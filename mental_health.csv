Depressed and miserable,"Hello, I am new here...
With my Depression, everyday is a struggle for me. From the moment I wake up, throughout the whole day and night.
I feel like my life is going downhill, and not much to look forward to in the future when ill-health and loneliness will take hold.
I am a single mom with 2 kids, son is 23 and daughter 21 years old. It has always been the three of us, and we are close with each other. I know that sooner or later, I will be an Empty Nester, and when that time comes, I will be devastated and miserable.
I can't do much about all of these, and am sad and lonely all the time. I feel I have lost all interest in things that I used to enjoy.
Can I get some advice from anyone, as to how I can be happy and motivated again?",depression
In this horrible rut again,"I'm 52 years old. Almost 4 weeks ago I woke up with awful vertigo. Room was spinning. Really really scared the crap out of me.  Turned out that I have BPPV, nothing serious. They treated it with physical therapy, and it's pretty much resolved. 
BUT the fear and anxiety about what the hell it was triggered me and now I'm in this awful rut of extreme morning anxiety and depression every day. This is my 4th major depression (MD).
I'm on the highest dose of Zoloft. My Psych gave me Buspar a few days ago but I haven't taken it yet.  I use a low dose of Valium each morning just to deal with the anxiety (I know the risks with it).
Previous episodes of depression were triggered by pregnancy, Prednisone, and I'm not sure what triggered the 3rd episode  
My question is has anyone else had a MD episode triggered by a really frightening event???",depression
Mail carrying blues,"I'm a mail carrier.  We are used to dealing with all kinds of sh*t, believe me.  The most recent, tho, is pretty weird and bad.  The new head postmaster general is making changes to undermine our organization and our ability to get your mail to you in a timely way, not to mention putting the carriers in harms way.  One way he is doing the latter is to change our start time to 8:30 a.m.  This is an outrageouly late start time for us.  Usually we start at around 7 to 7:30 a.m. because it takes time to get our mail, get out of the office, get the mail to you, etc.  Most of the routes are very long.  This is especially bad in summer because we can't ""beat the heat"" as well because we are starting later and in the winter it is bad because we are out there longer in the dark.
It's very depressing to have your boss forcing you into harm's way, making your job harder and making customer service worse.  I gripe a lot about my job, it is hard and a lot of the managers suck but I do take pride in my job.  Been doing it a long time.  I do care if people get their mail and get it in a timely way.  We deliver checks, birthday cards, meds, voter's ballots, tons and tons of packages, not to mention a friendly word to the lonely people out there who wait for their mail as the one of the highlights of their day.  Lots of dogs love us or love to hate us too.
This makes me really sad.  I don't think the postal service will ever fall completely, at least not in the near future because we are so tightly woven into the fabric of the American life.  But it sucks to have to deal with this kind of crappy corruption.  The mail carriers and clerks and mail handlers work really hard and we don't deserve to be treated like this.  We do all kind of dangerous and hard things on a daily basis just to get our jobs done and we deserve respect.  I think most Americal people understand what's going on but I wanted to write about this anyway.  
This new postmaster general is really corrupt so if you get your mail late or it's delayed, it's most likely his fault.  Yea, we make mistakes but I've never known a postal employee who was purposely trying to undermine service to the American people like this guy is.  It's shameful.  
There, I've said my peice.  I probably won't be with this job much longer anyway but I needed to get this out there.
Thanks for listening to my rant.",depression
I always feel fake,"been going through a lot of websites lately trying to find some type of support group because im in another one of my lows. With covid and everything I cant see my therapist in person. I can zoom but since i barely talk to her during our sessions to begin with because my anxiety, i havent brought myself to talk to her again yet. My meds seems to be wearing off, as if im getting too used to them. Too bad im maxed out on them looks like im going to have to move onto another one, so great. Last few days ive been pretty out of control feeling numb yet having outbursts of anger then crying for hours. Its been awhile since ive had these outbursts for an extended amount of time all at once. But anyway I just feel like such a fake person, I lie to everyione about how i feel because i dont actually know the answer either. In front of my friends im so happy, beyond happy. But the moment i hit my bed I feel so exahusted from all the lies and fake attitude I snap. Hate feeling like crap yet numb all day, somtimes i wish I got one of those bad diseases because someone who wants to live more then me dosent deserve to have it. Idk just something i feel guilty for but anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far sorry my grammar is a mess I dont sleep much unless I take my sleeping pills which also sucks cause i dont like starting another day over again just to feel the exact same. Any tips to just get my mind off things like a cool craft but not something too hard my motivation and willingness to get outta bed always overpowers.  ",depression
Vent: character development?,Idk what I’m honestly doing writing on here but hey I’m here anyways the last couple years have sucked and I haven’t handled them the best I’ve had manic breaks and went through yet another experience to give me ptsd I’ve been through dozens of horrible relationships experimented with my sexuality realizing I am a trans queer man but my mental health still has a stronger hold on me which I think I’ve been in denial over but idk if it’s good or bad that I’ve realized everything that went on but yeah character development  I guess lol ,depression
Battling my demons,I am a 20 yer old female. I never really believed I was depressed. I was always the happy friend of the group but here lately I haven't been myself. I reached out to my boyfriend and I let him in on my past. He knew I had had a rough life growing up. I lost my sister at the age of 16 due to addiction I gained my neice as a child. So it's always been hard to find someone to accept that part of me. I pushed everything down inside of me and just put a smile on my face and called it a day but I would come home and just lay around. My boyfriend has seen it all take a toll on me. He's been noticing a chane in me that I am not as outgoing as I used to be when we first met when we were 15. He's always held me when I get down on myself. We have been having problems because I don't open up to any one about how I am feeling. He is helping me through everything and trying but I just always push people away. I haven't told my parents how I am feeling because I am afraid. He's always been by my side and he's helping me seek professional help to try and help me and he wants me to tell my parents how I am feeling but I can't bring myself to do it. He hasn't left my side even if I have been ugly or rude towards him. He's never left my sie since I was 15. I have a cat as a coping mechanism and he went and got us a dog so I could sleep at night but I am up all hours of the night just laying in bed next to him staring at our celing. I am trying to get better but I am afriad talking to someone will just make it worse. I am just wondering if it ever gets better? He wants us to move to flordia and start all over for the both of us. We have both been batteling these demons together and we are both working on building to get better together. ,depression
Struggling with Opinions,"This may not be related to Depression, but I don't know where else to put. I feel like I need to vent about this. I am struggling with the part about opinions. I will think of an example. For example, if you explain what you don't like about cats, that's an opinion, right? Okay. What about talking bad about cats, is that an opinion? If that's yes, then I don't get it. I mean if you explain what you don't like about cats, then no need to talk bad about cats. That's called an opinion. I guess I am confused because if it is okay for you to talk bad about cats since you say that is an opinion. Does this mean it's okay for people to talk bad about my deceased mother because it's their ""opinion"" too? No way. That's not an opinion. I don't allow anyone to talk bad about my mother because she is NOT here and she is NOT here to defend herself. Can you see where I am coming from now??  ",depression
Lost,"I feel so utterly lost. I've pushed everyone away and stopped answering phone calls and texts. I know people are concerned, but I can't seem to care. I'm so depressed I was put on medication about 2 weeks ago, but I don't feel any different at the moment. Maybe it takes longer to work, I don't know. I am trying to get out of the depression episode I know to other they probably don't see it, but I really am. I don't want to be like this forever, but I know that's exactly what this is just an episode and it will pass like they always do, but it's hard to see the light when your the one stuck in it. I know my anixity/depression is something I'll never be truly ""cured"" of I will have to learn how to live with this and I guess this is just one of those bumps in the road. ",depression
Anxiety or Depression,"I am curious as to how to determine how much depression, how much anxiety.... and how to go about dealing with medication?
I have been on antidepressants for years and did increase my dosage for winter months (SAD--- way too dismal and bleak after New Year with short dark days and negative let downs of post holiday joys) Plus my husband just died the end of January. Obviously I am still on it .  I did recently spend some time with another man who did seem to notice that my mood is actually pretty good and positive... but I do have moments I am not clear on what to expect and tend to spaz and get overwhelmed... Said he sees more anxiety. 
I know they usually wean you off the anti Ds.... I  am wondering if anyone knows if I could go to a very low dose... and how is anxiety dealt with?  Meds when felt needed? Or always as a precaution?I would appreciate any feedback...
Thanx",depression
Completely Fake,"I've learned to pretend to be someone who isn't me, but when people want to know who I really am I fall into a depressive state. WHile being 'fake' has changed how others percive me, I still look at myself as a horrible person. Due to this I often going into a deep depressive state and cannot come out. Most people assume they've known the true me, but in actuality I know if they do then they will hate me, and for that I am unable to be true. ",depression
Question,"I was offered a position at a new lab, because the one I am working for has brought such a negative impact on my life that I had to take a stress leave for months. I'm not happy with the offer, even know my family has expressed their happiness over it, it made me cry because I'm not happy starting this over again. I've been so depressed it's made me ill in the stomach. 
I'm a slow learner and after a year I'm still making errors. It's a very hard job. And it wasn't fun. I am getting counseling soon, so I feel I need to reevaluate things but I don't have enough time. 
Should I just be realistic and just...buckle down and do the job? I'm living at home right now.

New here and first post,"Hello, 
I have just discovered this website few days ago and has taken me until now to post something. I have mild to severe depression and anxiety disorder. 
My depression hits a few days to a month at a time, and I do have coping mechanisms that help me when it's mild (my anxiety isn't as bad like it use to be years back). I also take medication morning and night. 
To start off on my first post, I'm curious to know how others here do to cope? All I've ever known was to sit it out an sleep. I have done self harm on myself few times, but I blank out when it happens. I can't make my family understand what I'm going through, so I hope to reach out here without judgement. Thank you for reading.

My lies fuel my depression and vice versa,"I've so good at hiding in plain sight...but my lies lately have led me to a fianancial and marital breakdown--in turn I lost my job after 9 years in in May and as a result , my depression is tuning me into knots---I dont know what to do--Is a inpatient stay helpful?

I'm at a crossroads ad I'm stuck",depression
Okay so I’m back (Off topic),"Hey guys it's been a long time some of you may remember me some of you might not I feel like I owe an explanation of why I disappeared 3 years ago and just didnt return.

Claustrophobic,"Someone posted about feeling Claustrophobic in Walmart and when I tried to reply, the site wouldn't let me. So, if you see this post I wanted to respond to your question. It doesn't sound like Claustrophobic as much as it sounds like Agoraphobia. I have that and can have panic attacks or high anxiety in crowded places. It wouldn't hurt to look into this. Wish I could have posted on your actual post and hope you see this. ",depression

More Bad News,"Well, just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, my grandfather passed away last night. I don't think it has really hit me yet and I don't really know that I have enough emotion left to deal with it honestly. He has had heart problems for a few years now but they got really bad in the past few months. He was admitted to the hospital early yesterday morning and they said he had pneumonia, his kidneys were failing and his blood pressure was 70/30. And also, because of coronavirus, nobody could go be with him since the visiting hours are only two hours per day, 1 family member per day. So my grandmother did not get to see him. 
And to make it worse, I have the worst ""best friend"" ever. We have been friends for 18 years and when I told her she said ""oh no, they shouldn't have brought him to the hospital, they should have just let him die at home. They had to know he wasn't going to make it."" which like, fine that can be your opinion, but also why is that the first thing you have to say to me when I just told you my grandfather died? I don't know, it just sucks because she is really the only friend that I have and she really isn't much of a friend. Just wish I could go to someone for support in real life instead of here for once.  ",depression
I need a break.,"Any more when i tell my family things i feel like i am speaking a foreign language. They ignore me, they ask ""what?"" If its as simple as telling my kid to sit while fishing on the boat they dont even acknowledge that i have spoken. I will repeat myself 2 -3 times before losing my cool and raising my voice and yelling it. To which all of them ask why i always yell.. Um. I didnt yell the first 3 times.. 
Whenever something happens (plans fall thru, store is out of some needed item, the pool is green, the kid gets in trouble for a bad decision) the blame is always turned on me! (Ex. Kid is hungry for dinner. I am putting dinner on the table. Kid throws a fit because they want to eat now not when daddy is ready, i get blamed.. The kid wouldnt be hungry if i would of fed them a better lunch.. Btw, the kids i refer to are 8 & 10)
when it comes to chores i am the one home so i should be doing it all.. No one else can help with laundry, cooking, cleaning, dishes... According to the kids its moms job and i am not gonna do it.. (Never mind the fact that they have had chores like putting their clean clothing away, unloading and loading the dishwasher, feeding and watering the animals)
ever since school went into the learning anywhere anytime i have been finding the kids watching you tube. They would waste hours watching videos if i was not constantly on them about doing other stuff. they throw fits constantly about having to shut it off. They fight and argue.. they try to sneak out of their rooms to play video games.. 
Whenever they dont get their way they feel the need to destroy something that isnt theirs.. (Husband included) 
I just need a break from all of this!  But thats not happening anytime soon.. 
To top all this off, i work as an aid in a school. I want to plan for school and work. But i cant do that till i know if my kids will get a 2, 3,or 5 day a week in person learning schedule.. I dont know what my work schedule will be.. its driving me crazy not knowing!!

Job Hunting in the Pandemic,"I'm not handling job hunting the Pandemic very well.  I had a remote interview yesterday that I may have inadvertendly (unconsciouly) sabotaged because I have been in the house with quarantine since March and truly don't want to go back to work the classroom.  I have had one traumatic experience after the next in the classroom, and these news reports of young or middle age people dying in horriffic conditions is just paralyzing. I read these stories and just freeze up.  A handful of my friends have contracted the coronavirus, and while they recovered, it did sound pretty formidable.
The interview went alright, I was so nervous, and then they asked me the classic question of ""Why do you want to work here""? You would think that someone with so much experience would be able to answer such a simple question, but did I? No...I started to ramble and blab on and on and say stupid things like, ""I have never worked for a school this big before..."" It is probably one of the most important questions of the interview. 
While I liked the interviewers and learning more about the position, the truth is that I am not sure a huge, massive high school is for me. I used to work in a small environment.  I don't want to do after school activities or clubs. The position is semi-part time, so that seems ok, but I don't want to be exposed to a massive number of people on a constant basis. I had one interview for a remote position, and that is a company that I know why I want to work there, but they have not called back.
My gut says that though it does seem like a good place and that I may like the people, maybe it truly is not for me. I don't know. I've never had to think about Corona.
I am getting on a live call today about possibly enrolling in school. Maybe take this direction with my life? Can I afford it? I don't know.",depression
Pushing people away...,"Hey everyone, recently my depression has been impacting me more than usual and I find myself pushing people away, especially old friends.  I'm not quite sure if I've outgrown the friendships or if my depression is making me self-isolate.  Either way, I do feel depressed.
Anyone else have this problem?",depression
Overwhelming depression,"My depression is becoming overwhelming.  I am not going to work at this point.  I wake up so depressed that I can't stand the pain.  This has been going on a long time and it's getting worse.  I am faced with deciding about retiring from a job I need but that I can barely do.  
I have been let down the my doctor, the suicide hotline and my counsellor.  I'm really desperate.  I don't know what to do.  The little distraction stuff doesn't work.  I'm broken.  My life is broken.  It's just reality.  I need someone to help me.  I have no friends or relationship.  I WANT to die to end the pain but my body still keeps going.  Makes no sense.  ",depression
NewHere and First Post,"Hello. I am new to this online support group thing. I suffer from mild to severe depression. It can last a few days to months at a time. I have ways of dealing and coping on my own, but find that talking helps a lot too. I don't always have access to my therapist and COVID-19 has made that more of a challenge. Today is an ok day. My family is not here to keep my mind busy and I feel myself sinking. I guess my biggest question right now is how has this forum helped you? Any and all suggestions are welcome. Thank you!",depression
Sad,Woke up this morning with an overwhelming feeling of sadness and loniness although I'm not really alone I feel like I am,depression
The bad side of hoping,"I read something on my phone today that I thought was interesting.  I've been extremely depressed lately, very frequent thoughts of suicide, barely getting around.  I was looking on my phone aimlessly and saw this article about the freedom in giving up hope. Can't remember exactly where I saw it.  Kind of made sense to me. said sometimes if you give up hope on something that isn't going well anyway that can be freeing. 
I thought of some of the things that I had or do hope for that aren't going well;  finding friends in real life, owning home or having long term financial security, finding a partner, having good health and losing weight, etc.  big things.  i started to imagine what it would feel like if i gave up hope on those things one by one.  I can't say it made me feel happy, in fact it made me feel pain, but instead of feeling anxious and guilty and responsible and stressed in addition to the pain, I just felt the pain.  It was kind of a feeling of relief in some ways.  I guess I felt like it was somewhat of an improvement.
I just thought I'd share that in case it was of use to anyone.  I think it must be something about letting go and not expecting so much and all that.  Another example is my job.  My job really sucks.  If i accept it is never going to get better and I probalby should just leave that gives me a little feeling of relief.  Even if it's wrong financially and practically and all that, I feel like giving up on it is somehow healthier and much easier for me than constantly trying to make it work and hoping it will work.
Another example for me.  I have had a hopeless crush on this man for about 8 years.  I know he isn't interested in me so I don't have to give up on that but sometimes I feel bad about myself for still liking him.  When I think about giving up hope on not liking him, I feel a little better.  Yea, so I am always going to have a hopeless crush, so what.  I feel a little less bad about myself if I stop judging myself so harshly for it.
I don't know this is probaby stupid.  Forgive me.  I feel like I'm going insane.   ",depression
Feeling Like A Loser,"It's been awhile since i've posted anything on here. Ive had a rough week. So i had a job, got fired back in October of last year. I got fired for BS reasons. I was working at Acme, a grocery store. I was told the reason was my lack of hustle. I got no warnings, write ups nothing. I wasn't spoken to about my job performance. I knew i had to do better. I thought i was improving. I said this to make sense of what i'm about to say. So a little after i got fired i got a match on Tinder a week or two after. She asked me what i do for a job. I told her i was recently fired from a job. I had an interview on Monday i told her. She than says it's getting late i'm going to bed. That's the last time i spoke to her. So this happened again this week. I thought this girl was different. I was wrong. So i messed up. I never intended to ask her what she does for a living. I meant to ask what she did for the weekend. But it came out as what does she do for a job. So i tell her that i wasn't proud of my situation. That i had a job, got screwed. Said i been looking for work, had a few interviews but no luck. That was on Tuesday. I don't know what to do anymore. ",depression

Stressed and mind block,"I am a little stressed and don't know what is the right thing to do. My Mom has a blocked coronary artery blockage, and because of the block, blood is not passing into the left side of her heart. My Mom would normally need surgery to have a stent put in but the doctors are not keen because (a) risk of COVID infection in hospital, (b) higher risk of adverse events as Mom is now 84 years old, (c) Mom is afraid of hospital and/or surgeries. The doctors say that Mom will risk having a heart attack and/or developing heart failure if surgery is not done to restore blood to the left side of the heart. Mom has a little bit of dementia, but she is very active, likes to exercise, walking, climbing, gardening ---- all of these activities trigger chest pain and predispose her to heart attacks if she does not undergo surgery to restore blood flow to her heart. My Mom's side of the family, due to good genes, live to more than 100 years old. Mom is quite healthy if I overlook the coronary blockage and dementia. The doctors say if surgery is delayed, the stenting will be more risky if it is done later in her life. If Mom is not so active and live to the max, then having medications to treat the blockage is least invasive, but my Mom is THE original flower power feminist rebel who wants to do anything that she pleases, even if it kills her.
My siblings won't get involved and has dumped the responsibility of the decision on my laps. I want my Mom to be healthy, happy and has good longevity to enjoy life, but then there are the risks... I am unhappy that the doctors and my family lump this rock on my head? I wonder what are the pros and cons I have to consider to reap the best benefits but at minimal risks for my Mom? My brain is so stuffed, I cannot think this through clearly. I wonder if my friends on the forum have any ideas for me to arrive at a solution. Thank you so much.

We are coming up on 2 years of my sisters passing and I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am depressed again always working avoiding my family and just very unsure and unhappy with life it self and I feel like i can never please or doing anything right to make others happen so I find joy In other place in my life, like going to work and seeing my coworkers or going out with my friend and spending money . I just dont know what to do and now having to move out my grandparents getting on my my cousin is even pissing me off because there certain odors he is not found of.... well neither am I buddy but I dont complain. But I guess that's just me please pray for me k need some prayers.",depression
My boyfriend is depressed,"A week or so ago I had posted about my boyfriend who has depression and how he is pushing everyone away, including me.  Things are progressing to a point to where I feel he is going to end the relationship.  He keeps saying he wants to leave everyone and get away from everything and has plans to go away for a few days and then wants to move away.  I am so tired of caring, being supportive and sacrificing my life for him.  Year after year its about him and here I am getting nothing and now I need to even sacrifice more because of him being depressed?  When he tells me he is leaving, I simply say okay, let me know when and if there is anything I can do to help.  I have researched how to treat someone with depression and basically its sacrificing your own needs to help them.  I have been for 6 years and I am exhausted!  I think he feels I come across as clingy and needy but its because I am bone dry!  I am thirsty for love and attention that I haven't gotten.  I just can't take it anymore.  Its like I have to be there for him when he needs me.  He can call or text anytime and Im there but if I need something, like just a call to say goodnight, I feel like a burden to him.  Im insecure all the time, especially since he says he's going to leave anytime.  I never know when that time is and I deal with daily anxiety because of it. Im not in a good place right now and my therapist says Im depressed.  Has anyone been through this with things actually getting better?  I just can't take it anymore.  Im tired of being the partner I wish someone was to me.  Im just a wreck right now.  ",depression
Just hopeless,"I'm a 28 yo female, im good looking, highly educated and cultured person, but people just seems to dislike me for whom I am, I also seem to fail at everything. I'm really tired of myself, I have hate myself all my life, being in therapy, multiple medication, nothings seems to help for more than a few days. I got divorced few months ago from a very abusive man who called me crazy and irrational all the time because I didn't want to do crystal meth or keep supporting him. I moved across the country to open my new business but im so scared im.going to fail, I tried online dating and it was even worst, people there made me feel.like garbage. I very luky i got 2 friends, but they are busy whit their careers ans relationships. 
I never thought I would find myself at 28 lonely, divorce, living out of my parents, just sad all the time... if it was not for my parents I would have kill myself long ago, I have fail to see the bright side of life, even tho I know im.lucky to have amazing parents and economic security.... and whit all is going on, I really don't want to keep going, I haven't been living during all my life, I been scrambling ans surviving thru my feelings... I sorry I know I sound like a breath wining but its how I have felt of my life and always failed to express it because people just point how easy my life has been (having loving parents ans financial support) 
Sorry for the ranting, but I guess annonimitt gives the relive to say what is in out minds and as sad as it is, I know plenty of people feel the same.

Sorry for the spelling. I'm dyslexic ans fail to see some.obvious mistakes ",depression
anger? (trigger?),"Anyone willing to lend some insight?
I've struggled with depression on and off for a long time, it's a chronic condition for me.  I have good times and bad times. I used to go to a support group with a coach, who quit a long time ago. He has come back to do zoom support groups during the pandemic. He is cool, and pretty popular with a lot of people.  I think I have changed, though, and in some ways I find him ineffective and in a passive way, harmful?  He is not a professional counselor but has a life-coach background.  He helped me after I came out of the hospital during unemployment at the time of the recession around 2008.  And here we go again with that...
He quit later on, I coached with him at that time for about two years.  It seemed with the issue of domestic violence that I was going through, he just could not handle it.  Ironically when he quit, and a coach in the community stepped up to take his place, she pushed me forward fast and insisted that I leave my abuse situation, and my life improved dramatically. He never did that. In retrospect, I often wondered while there was a ""feel good"" element to his groups, whether I or other people were truly making progress.
One of the things that I did when I got the stimulus money was a had a session via skype with a psychotherapist-an expert in her field. Within one hour, I was so amazed at how he was able to target and identify so many things. When I told her the severe physical abuse I went through in the past and the trouble with current relationships I have. She said, ""You really need to revisit and make sense of what happened, and realize that anger is helpful in moving past or not allowing others to abuse you.""
I had never thought about that, but I realized when I finally left my abuser for good after years and years, it was because, actually, I got so angry I put a complete end to all of his threats. My life was even in danger.  I also don't think holding on to anger and rage constantly is a good idea and to live that way is really destructive.  
(I also have a regular therapist)
I've been going to the coach's groups weekly online as this pandemic just drags on and on...but I've noticed something interesting. I see it differently now. He had been on hiatus for like four years. He admits at the beginning of every meeting lately that he has issues with his temper and curses, etc.  He doesn't realize that I actually drove past him one day and saw him flipping out in his car.  I've also noticed he makes comments ""on my anger"" every time I go to the zoom meeting.  Oddly, I'm not feeling really angry when I'm sharing. Mostly sad about what is going on. People who know me and my therapist have never told me that I need to do something about my anger. It just seems strange. I know when I get depressed it actually looks like I'm angry and can seem that way to people, but what's odd about the group is when I talk about what's bothering me (being unemployed and still on lockdown) he seems to get critical, and just tells me to be grateful.  I don't know...there was a lady there who was wronged by a doctor-he actuallly was hurting her. She had a frozen shoulder and he messed up, not treating her and hurting her worse. The coach responded with this 'happy happy response' and said, smiling, ""feel grateful for your other shoulder."" That didn't make a lot of sense. Wouldn't it make sense to be upset if a medical practitioner hurt you and you would want to do something about it?
I almost wonder because of what strikes me as a passive approach...to basically everything...is why I stayed in abuse for so long. As I look back, I realized that after a while our conversations were ineffective and it wasn't until someone else stepped in and demanded that I pull myself out of abuse, that things really changed. And that involved some SEVERE discomfort and anger.  Not permanent, though. My current therapist doesn't act like this...if I tell her something bad happened she helps me see how I can work to get past the bad feeling and take Action to change for the better (cognitive behavioral).  She doesn't try to shut me up and say, ""ok there is your anger again.""
Ironically, him telling me this...actually does make me angry. It reminded me of when my dad was beating me and said, ""you have an anger problem."" I also think he's kind of a hypocrite because he talks about his own times when he goes off on rages. He says I use anger to protect myself...I believe that is the idea, isn't it supposed to keep the wrong people at bay?  I mean negative feelings can be crucial infomation as to what you are encountering in day to day life. 
Of course, if you are bitter and angry all the time, yes you will ruin your life, but I've witnessed him talking to others and it seems somewhat irrational or even outrageous to just 'sit there and be grateful, namaste' on every little thing, when you probably should not be. If I was the coach, I would counsel the person to use her discomfort and upset to be assertive and confront the doctor and seek remedy-and another doctor. I wouldn't tell her to be grateful for her other shoulder.  It's sort of like, ""I know I'm beating you almost to death, just be grateful for when I'm not.""",depression
The COVID 19 blues,"Wow, what a situation. Everyday. On the news. Thankfully I don't have to go out into the work force. Its just, plain sad. All the loss. 
I try to keep busy around the house. Limit my going out. Wear my mask, keep my hands clean. ",depression
still coping,"So, I ended up going back to a different support group online. It was better.  I don't know if anyone remembers, but I was going to one and the guy kept getting on me about anger, when I didn't even really feel angry.  It's funny, because one of the issues that I was bringing to the group was this odd, but ongoing problem that I've had since the pandemic, and it's that I am not getting my mail.  I know that sounds odd, but it has worn me down tremendously with all of the trips to the post office. It's crucial to get your mail-becuase bills, etc. Not to mention that the box was broken into prior to the pandemic. I had the mail go to a PO box and then had it re-keyed. Since it was re-keyed and rerouted back to my house, the mail has just vanished. It's been like three weeks and I no longer get it. Not good. I need my car tags and health insurance cards.
So, back to the post office. They have been really awful. Just no help. The other post office that was taking care of my PO Box was OK.  So I had to go back today, and it's an hour minimum each time. I mean creditors, the IRS and whomever else will not accept the excuse that I am not getting it. So I was standing there when the person ahead of me was going on and on; they were not getting their mail, either. What a disaster. People were lining up. I started talking to her about it. She said it was the worst post office ever and to get online and to contact postmaster general.
When I asked them if they were still holding my mail at the post office, they said that they were not, but that it was not coming to my box, nor was in the Post Office.  So where is it? It's been like three weeks since the re-key and reroute back to my house, so what gives? I expressed that I thought that it was incredibly fishy, that ok, that the theft is now not from the outside, but is looking like it's from the inside? So, what now then? Was it made to look like an outer break-in when in fact now with the re-key the mail is missing completely? She asked if anyone else has a key to the box. They don't. This is why I re keyed it. I told her that the mail would not simply disappear into the ether or the twilight zone, and that receiving mail is a big deal-in fact violation of it is a federal offense. People in the office were talking about it.  I'm quite concerned now about identity theft and financial compromise. This is why I had a secure box at the other post office.  Identity and financial theft can destroy you for a long time.  I conveyed that since now the situation has been narrowed down to the post office and that all of the other variables have been isolated off. She just stared back at me.
When I talked about this at the support group, the ""coach"" just talked down to me, accused me of having an anger problem...yeah...sure...so just stand here and watch my personal and financial information be taken?? When I went to the other post office there was a guy there who *really* got mad. Like seriously. He came in, screaming refused to wait in  line. Apparently they had his ID and would not give it back. He was making a total scene. He also claimed personal discrimination. He started shouting, ""this is why people go postal."" Now, granted, I'm really upset but I don't think I""m gonna go there. 
When I talked to the woman in line, she said to get online. I found the postmaster and they have him there with a media contact. I certainly hope this gets straightened soon and will resume normalcy, when I get the mail at my other PO box like I was. It worries me.
I also don't want to go to the group, I'm scared of the actively suicidal people there making threats. The coach doesn't even call the authorities. It's a trigger for me since I made an attempt a long time ago. ",depression
The Moods They Are A Swingin',"After my post ""Of Chickens and Eggs,"" I felt compelled to report that I had a fantastic day yesterday.  I don't know what caused it.  Perhaps it was all of your advice and well wishes.  Whatever the cause, yesterday was the kind of day I wish I had every day.  I woke at 5:00am and worked very hard, with focused energy until 5:00pm.  There were some new stressful things that happened yesterday (one was a tax bill MUCH higher than expected), but I shrugged off the potentially debilitating stressor with ease.  It was like water rolling off a ducks back.  BTW, if you have never seen water rolling off a ducks back, be observant next time you have a chance.  The water turns into little balls and simply rolls off.  The duck doesn't get wet.  It's a great image to have when stressors show up and try to throw you off track.
My best to you all.  Just wanted to leave a positive post for once.",depression
Pointless.,"So everything feels pointless. I have no plan, but so much thought around just letting go.
I'm in pain, daily, mentally, physically and I can't remember the last time I truly had a 'good day' some better days, times when I've laughed and felt functional.
Sometimes I wonder if I deserve to feel this way, and should just accept it and continue, maybe someone else will be spared if the clouds hover. Sometimes I wonder why one cut, or twenty isn't enough... why pain remains there, but is now assisted by guilt, shame and self consciousness. 
I don't want to be without the people I truly love and care about. But I don't want to burden them either. It's all just on top of me and I can't switch off the dark thoughts anymore ",depression
"trying to cope, ramble, Trigger warn","I don't know if crying hysterically is a good or bad thing. One thing about dealing with depression is that I really try to avoid getting emotional. No matter how terrible I feel, I just tell myself to suck it up and don't cry. I high-function for a long time, and keep up a pretty good type-A front, which is probably pretty hysterical. I almost wonder if forcing yourself ""not to be depressed"" is what actually makes one depressed. I don't know.
I don't like to talk about where I live on these boards, or give away details, but I will say I live in a place in the country that is one of the most hard hit by the virus and I'm scared. So scared that I tell myself I'm not scared, and try to force myself to keep it together. Two of my friends have to quarantine again due to exposure. I feel bad for them. 
After about three-four months of isolation and sadness, my birthday came.  I told myself it should not be such a big deal that I will not see anyone for my birthday this year, as everyone is terrified and social distancing. Because I'm middle aged now I should be grown up.  The sadness of losing this, also, to this pandemic got to me.  I decided to take a trip to the Grand Canyon on my own (social distance again, enforced) as I live close, as I've lost so much else. So I did a trip, was masked, cleaned the hotel rooms with santizer extensively and took off the pillow cases and stayed in a stunningly beautiful resort. It was so awkward-still could not eat out-hostesses were absolutely terrified and frozen, so I got takeout instead.  All of the arrows/six-feet markers on the ground confused me as to ""how to go through the restaurant.""  I don't know how to do a freaking thing anymore socially after 90 days, as I've barely seen a soul. Now I'm released to the awkwardness of actual social interaction rather than a computer screen chat, and the game is changed. I feel like I'm at my first middle-school dance and I just tripped in front of everyone. 
Everyone is unsure, but desperate to connect. I interacted with more human beings at six feet than I have since March, felt grateful.  So many said stories!  An ER nurse who had the virus and recovered. Her husband pounded on her chest when he feared losing her.  A masked businesswoman who almost cried about having to sell all and close. But I still had an amazing time, got to see the Canyon for the first time in 30 years, saw a deer, it was stunning, bought some books and read them. I was reprimanded nicely for testing a potential guitar at the store, because they would have to clean it. I was so humiliated. I saw pity in the guy's eyes. 
Even forgot about this stupid thing for a while, then as soon as I returned home, I just cried and cried and cried and cried. I mean I could not stop. Had a fantastic time on the trip, but the whole magnitude of this thing came down on me, the whole emotion I have been strenuously avoiding as much as possible crushed me. I was just sobbing and could not stop. I can't see my parents because they are elderly, four months now. Can't see my other elderly friends either. End in sight? My mom dropped off a card and said getting together will wait.  I know when I run errands why there is such an uptick in the ambulances that are going by-I've never heard so many.
Oddly I feel much better after crying this way. I almost wonder if depression that I've dealt with is so much worse because I staunchly tell myself to feel the opposite. I just gave into my feelings instead of constantly fighting them and now I sense that they are not controlling me nearly as much.",depression
Of Chickens and Eggs,"I finally discovered what I am good at, just in these past few days.  I know what it is now.  I am a world-class depressor.  I do depression like no one I know.  I don't want to be dismissive of others who experience deep depression.  There are probably people in this DS Group that struggle with depression more than me.  Suffice it to say, I am very good at it.
Here is depression for me:  (1) Physical tiredness.  Not always sleepiness, but I am physically weak.  I wish I could sleep and feel rejuvinated, but sleep doesnt' seem to help at all.  (2) A tremendous, monumental, insurmountable lack of motivation.  There is no task too small for me it to make me feel overwhelmed.  When I force myself to start a task, it feels 10x harder than it should.  I am highly ineffective and quit very quickly.  (3) All problems look like mountains.  Things that would normally be small challenges I could easily overcome feel like crushing problems.
I often wonder what came first, the chicken (my depression) or the egg (physiological, biochemical things happening in my brain).  I believe that when we are in a deep depression there must be something that has changed in my brain chemistry.  But did the thoughts generate that change, or did the change in brain chemistry generate the thoughts?
I have more to say, but this post is getting long.  I'll stop here for now.  Does anyone have something to say that could make me feel better.  I did change my little mood icon to the one that shows I am feeling horrible.  That helped a little.",depression
Very down,"I came back from my Mom's and I feel raw.  I felt lonely and now more so.  I feel like doing nothing now.  I cared and just got hurt.  There is not much of connection with her or anyone it seems right now.

"Morning depression, possible triggers","I've written about this before but i need to write again i guess.  I write here a lot.  thank god i have a place to vent.  i have been very depressed lately, well, it's ongong but I have major stresses going on in my life.  Work, family trouble, out there and working with covid, my fairly unusually personality and more usual bad childhood.  I say unusual personality in that I am very shy.  Most people who meet me say i'm the shyest person they know.  I'm naturally very introvered and I am highly sensitive to outside stimuli, like light and noise and just going to the store bothers me.  I like the house to be very quiet, the lights to be low or off and I actually feel best when I'm in bed at night with the lights off and in complete silence.  I guess there are some people like this but I think it's not as common as extroversion or lesser forms of introversion.
ANYWAY, god, it's like a have been just vomiting words lately in writing and talking (mostly to myself and my imaginary friends and cat).  the stress is really getting to me.  but I wanted to talk again about my morning depression.  Upon waking, especially on workday but pretty much every day, I am deeply depressed.  I mean scary depressed.  Like I would rather die than go through another day and face the life and future i most likely have and the way I feel i woudln't wish on anyone.  
I have tried to talk to my doctor mulitiple times about my depression.  Once I said flat out ""I want to die"" and he didn't look up from his computer.  Most people are not too friendly to me.  They don't really know me and are probably reacting to my quiet personality but it's really hard.  I feel like I am being shunned.  Like an animal that leaves the herd and is on it's own and is then much more vulnerable because he doesn't have herd support and protection.  That's me.
I do think a lot about dying as a form of relief from pain for myself.  I don't believe in it, suicide I mean, but I understand when the pain is so great and so long term that one just needs it to stop.  Once, I watched a video of someone jumping off a bridge.  I wasn't going to watch it, I thought it was obscene that it was filmed and watched but then my morbid curiousity got the best of me.  It was a man, I couldn't see him that well.  He was in his 20's or 30's probably.  He was wearing all black.  He stood by the rail of the bridge and looked into the water.  then he dropped a twig in a watched it fall all the way down to the water and make a small splash.  then he climbed up on the rail and stood on the top rail, his back to the water, his arms outstretched and he just leaned backward and fell.  He hit the water with a huge splash and that was it.  
The weird thing is that I thought that i would be horrified or repulsed or ashamed that I watched but when he hit the water I felt this surge of joy for him.  I wasn't sadistic, it was this feeling of release from pain that I guess I felt vicariously for him and it brought me to tears.  I was shocked by my reaction.  there were other videos like this but I didn't watch anymore.  This was just one documentary called The Bridge I think.  I won't watch anything like that again but I just thought it was so odd how I felt. 
Because the pain I feel, my god, when I think of not having to feel that anymore it almost brings me to tears and gives me a similar feeling of joy.
I am not advocating suicide for anyone!  I probably shouldn't even be writing this here because i know there are very depressed people on here but I also thought you might understand.  I do think we should all keep fighting but it is so very hard some times.
forgive me for talking about that.  I just felt like I wanted to share that because I have been focused a lot on ending my life.  I don't think I will but I do think about it a lot.  I even looked into physician assisted suicide for depression and they actually do that in the Netherlands but you have to be a resident.  I read about it a little bit and that did repulse me.  Some doctor euthanized a young anorexic girl.  I think that is a slipperly slope.
Sometimes I wonder if I am manic depressive.  I've never been diagnosed with that but I have these kind of manic phases kind of like I am having now I think when I write a lot and talk a lot and really fast and I feel extremely agitated even though I am physically exhausted.  I'd talk to my doctor about it but...  yea.
I do have a therapist but she doesn't seem that skilled.  She's give me more like practical help and tips but we don't really delve deeply into anything and I'm coming to think that's because she doesn't know her stuff or whatever.
Well, whew, thank you for letting me vent.  I've got all this stuff pent up and I feel like I am going to explode.  I just want to be, I don't want to always be doing on thing after another that is hard or that I hate or that is dangerous.
Again, I am sorry if something I wrote triggered anyone but i think everyone here understands.  I'm ok for now, I need to rest and make dinner and then try to get to bed early.
Thank you for listening to me.  It makes me feel less alone.

Thank you all...,"Thanks to you all!!  I cannot tell you how much you have all helped me, I got a LOT of insight, tips, help, support......this was just amazing.  I am aware some of this is problems w/ me also, no one is perfect, and honestly, I am doing the best I can, it probably has to do with MY feeling unloved while I was growing up, and I DO feel terrible if I have an effect on my daughter.  I do go for help, I will speak to my counselor once a week, and tomorrow when I speak to her, we are going to discuss all of this.
I would love it if she would come to counseling w/me also, or on her own, I've been very careful to bring this up, waited for the right time, was very gentle, but she wasn't interested in going.  I will keep gently trying and eventually maybe she'll go to counseling.  Yes I will tell her I love her, which I really do....

I don't know what to do......,"Hi, I am new to this group and am distressed b/c I don't know how to handle this:
I have a 27 year old daughter, who lives with me in an apartment.  She's an only child, very smart and pretty, excelled in college.  Seemed like she had a bright future ahead ofher.   Now, I don't know how to handle this:  PLEASE can someone help me, I'll describe below, but if anyone can give me some tips on what to say to her, oh would I love that.
Things really started getting out of control, when she was horsing around with a male friend of hers who was trying to give her a piggy back ride.  Well they both toppled over, and since my daughter was higher up, she crashed down hard and broke all her front teeth.  I didn't find out what happened until much later, she was telling me she was walking and she fell (of course I didn't believe her).
Even though she's pretty and approachable, when a male seems interested in her, she goes overboard, gets ridiculously excited, probably has sex with them too soon, and then whatever relationship she has, fails.  So, she's an only child who can't seem to get a mate, and is very lonely.  No self esteem at all.
One of the thing she did was invest all her money in a really dumb investment, that a guy she knew told her to invest in.  She had her money invested in a place where they WERE making her money.  Of course, this new investment isn't making her money, it's losing.
Just recently, at her job in a medical office,  an office manager from another company called with a problem, my daughter helped this manager, manager told her over the phone how smart she was and how she wished she had employees like my daughter.  Next thing you know, this ""stranger"" over the phone is offering my daughter a job interview via Skype.  They have the interview, and my daughter comes out of her room beyond ridiculously excited, teling me she got another job, and that she is going to quit her old job.  I ask her how much money she'll make, and she tells me it's LESS than what she's making now.  Next day, she told me she quit her old job, then she shows me the ""contract"" she signed.  Well get this, she's making less money, has only FIVE PTO days a year (yes you read it right, FIVE), works longer hours and works every other Saturday and they stuck her with the front desk medical office position, where she works her butt off.  (The ""contract"" didn't state her Job position).   I was totally dumfounded that she would do something so stupid.  She didn't even go and SEE her new office job, where it's located, nor find out if they had any parking, PLUS it's further away from home, and she has a car with over 100,000 miles on it!!! She's an adult now--I can't believe she did this, and now the depression is really showing big time, and being her mom, of course she won't talk to me, and she has no one to turn to, we have an extremely small (almost non-existant) family.
I tried to gently talk to her and ask her what's wrong, and that if she had a problem I knew a place where she could talk to someone to help her.  Of course, she refused and won't talk.
If she's not at work, then she's home, always laying around, never doing anything at home at all, never talking, just laying in her bed, staring at her phone, never ever getting any exercise or fresh air.   Her mail just piles up, and even though it's very important, she doesn't open it.  She lays in bed in her room with the windows and doors closed, and it's hot as hell in there, and she ends up falling asleep real early b/c it's so hot in there.  One time I just went in there and opened the window myself (but she wouldn't do it on her own).
I've tried.  I'm at wits end.  I don't know what to do, it's very painful for me to see her like this.  Most of her friends have moved on, gotten married, good jobs, or moved away.  And she's still home laying around.  Please if anyone can advise me on what to do or say to help her, I would appreciate it so much!!

Depression sucks!!,"Hi, I'm new here.  I hope everyone is being gentle with yourselves, especially during this pandemic.  Depression is an aweful, aweful thing.  I have been living through some of the worst feelings of my life lately.  I ended a serious relationship in January.  We were engaged to be married.  Mourning the loss of my future dreams with this man and missing him emensly are the worst feelings in the world.  Then my mother passed away in March.  My saddness just got a whole lot worse. I couldn't get off the couch for weeks. My sister and I had a falling out just as Covid hit.  Isolation, anxiety, loss of relationship, loss of his friends, loss of sister, actual death of mother, work stress, single mother worried sick for my kids stress, financial stress, more isolation, more isolation, and more isolation.  Too much isolation!!!
So, I am starting to come out of it - slowly having more better days than bad days.  I've had a few past bouts of depression but nothing like this.  Trying most days to pull myself out of it without medication.
Hopefully time will heal this one,
Hugs to you all :)

Help,"So, things are really just getting bad. Like, out of control bad. I don't even know where to begin. I have continued to not have any success in finding a job, and I have become increasingly aware of the fact that I really can't even handle a job right now with how bad everything is. My anxiety is so bad that when I've gone to the store recently I have been forgetting like half of the things I'm there to get because I am so anxious that I can't do anything but think about how I can leave the quickest. It's to a point where I can't even look or really even think about a job application without crying for the rest of the day. But also a lot of my problems come from the fact that I don't have a job. My family thinks I'm a loser and is disappointed in me, and my mom constantly reminds me that nothing I have is mine. So I don't know what to do about that.
I've had to talk to the hotline 2 more times since my first post here because I have nowhere else to really go. I spend most days afraid that I am going to do something to myself. Some days I just spend hours on google researching different therapists and inpatient/outpatient programs, but that seems like a waste of time too because I can't talk to anyone about it that could help me get any of those things. I just feel like everything is so out of control, I feel completely helpless because my anxiety and depression have me almost paralyzed right now, and I know that everyone around me has to be able to see that, at least a little bit. There is no way both of my sisters and my parents have no idea that I am not doing well. I want to scream for help, I want to break down and just let it all out and I don't know how. In some ways I feel like I am, I spend all day in my room, I usually end up going to the dinner table at night with puffy red eyes from crying all day, I don't know, maybe it is not obvious to anyone but me. 
I am not sure what to do anymore. ",depression
Covid stress and death,"There's been so many changes and limitations put forth in the last few weeks its sometimes hard to keep up or remember what day it is. I'm an essential worker risking my health and sanity to keep grocery store shelves stocked so your family can eat. There's been a lot of long days, grueling loads to throw and more rude customers that I've lost count of. And now on top of all this I find myself trying to find time to grieve the sudden loss of my uncle from a heart attack. Covid 19 restrictions took away our chance to say goodbye and be with him in the end, a greedy and selfish family member took away our chance of a funeral. This person had now also turned to threats and finger pointing to get what he wants. When the phone rings at 4am you know its never gonna be good news, but why it had to bring this much paint and frustration with it idk. I feel so lost and heartbroken right now.....",depression
My boyfriend is leaving me due to his depression,"I really need advice.  I posted this in another group but wanted to see if any of you can help me as well. My boyfriend of over 5 years has been very depressed.  Pretty much through the whole relationship and probably before me.  It has just been getting worse.  His health isn't well.  He has been having bad stomach issues for a few years now and is in almost constant pain and its getting worse.  His drinking has been increasing to where he drinks everyday.  He decreased his days at work to only two a day because he said it was too stressful.  He is irritable all the time.  Never wants to go do anything except sit in his room smoking a drinking or going to the bars with his friends.  He has been saying he wants to just leave the state to get away from everyone and at first I thought it was him just saying it due to being stressed.  Tonight he basically told me he is going to move away.  He's tired of everyone and everything and wants to get away from the bullshit.  This means he is moving away from me too and he said Im part of the problem.  He said he wants NO responsibilty and nothing to hold him from doing whatever he wants to do.  I asked him if this was just his way of breaking up with me because he doesn't love me anymore and he said it wasn't that.  He said he will always love me and that Im his soul mate but he isn't happy.  So the man that I have stood by for so long through all of his depression throughout the years, been through him cheating, his alcohol problems and all the craziness his life has been is now leaving me.  We aren't broken up yet but he said he will be leaving soon.  He saved up a little money and wants to just leave.
Has anyone here dealt with a breakup due to their partner's depression?  Im having a really hard time understanding this because from where I sit, his life doesn't seem that horrible to me.  I feel he is the reason it is the way it is.  He hates living with his sister but he put himself there.  He hates his job, most people do.  His body hurt but he is causing a lot of issues by not taking care of himself.  I do feel he is in a horrible depression and he is walking away from not only me but his friends here and his family.  Is there anything i can do to make his see what he is doing, what he is giving up?  Is a change a good thing if you are depressed?  I feel he carries his issues with him and no matter where he goes, there is going to be bullshit to deal with.  He blames everyone around him for some reason.  
I am so heartbroken.  I have been through three breakups with him before which I had to walk away from him because he was affecting me.  I don't know how I am going to move forward after this.  I have very bad adbandonment issues and I feel him leaving is going to put me over the edge.  I have never put so much sweat, and tears into anyone in my whole life and he is still leaving anyway.  I don't know what to do.  I want to help him but don't know how.  I think the only option I have is to let him leave.  I am so hurt!",depression

My medication is starting to work,"Hi everyone. Blessings to anyone on here who sees this ❤️
Ive been on Lexapro for two weeks now. At first, it made me feel weird physically but now that days have gone by I noticed one thing.... I am not feeling depressed. Now granted, my episode fizzled out a day or two after initially taking it and I was told it may be a while before noticing anything. My friends, I was crying at my new dentists office as soon as I walked in and was terribly embarrassed and it's like everywhere I went I was crying uncontrollably the past month. Now, I feel 0 sad emotions for no reason (at least lately) and that has allowed me to start caring for myself like I never have before. It's slow but I went to the gym last night. That was huuuuuge for me. I still feel very anxious and that feeling hasn't really decreased yet but I do feel like I'm making improvements o I'm going with this positive energy I haven't felt for a while. I also said ""life is good"" yesterday.... even though it's clearly not great in the world right now, but I noticed how stable I felt even with everything going on...

What a day !,"I was doing a psychometric test online for the recruiter of the place I was applying for, and my computer crashed right before the second psychometric test was about to start. I had to ring IT and no one wanted to help even though they were online because they had to sign off after 5pm. So I had to write a lengthy explanation to the recruiter to request the test to be reuploaded, and no one wanted to do anything until Monday morning. I hope the recruiter would not think I was trying to avoid doing the psychometric test.
Then my computer crashed continuously for 5 hours whilst I was trying to fix it, and neither of my Windows or Office Pro was working. I have three millions urgent assessments that I must submit to my online teacher before midnight and the Word program has locked itself to prevent me from editing the content. This entire day has been a nightmare.

I feel sorry for myself.  No one should have to feel this bad for this long.  I can distract myself for awhile but it always comes back to this.  
I write here a lot.  I appreciate the support but sometimes I feel like there is just no point in even writing.  It's nice that people have tried to help me but nothing works.

New member and fed up,"Been on and off battling depression but since lockdown being stuck at home with my family has damaged my mental health, my mother blames me for everything wrong with her life, she makes me feel so small and angry and I feel trapped here, no one can do anything in this house I have to do every single chore but nothing I do is good enough. Having my job and getting away from this made life easier to deal with but I'm finding it so hard to stay positive and really don't want to live anymore.

Irritated and annoyed,"I am still having a hard time with this coronavirus.  It is really bad where I live, and has gotten much worse here, so it is sort of like the full lockdown but not quite. Very hard to plan or do anything. I had plans for an outdoor event last week, and was looking forward to it all week...and it got cancelled. Was going to go to a support group that was being held outdoors, that was cancelled too.  Tried to get out of the house for an hour or so this weekend in between finishing homework and it turned out to be not so good. I was reminded of why I don't go to catholic mass anymore.  They were serving communion on the way out; I really didn't want to take it and touch my face, I felt compelled to, so I took the wafer and stood there, kind of waffling. The priest was confrontational and aggressive and told me, ""maam, you can't walk away with that!  You have to consume it here!""  I told him I was uncomfortable touching my face at all so he had me give it back to him. I felt it was a real scene and I was so embarrassed. I really wanted just to get out of the house for an hour or so from a break from all the cancellations and the isolation, and then this happened.  I thought the sermon had helped and felt better about it, but the scene/incident at the end totally ruined it.  Now I feel like I really can't go back. My main place that I go, that is not like this, is closed indefinitely.  I hate this.
On Sunday I went to a friend's house so that he could help me do some review/feedback on some homework. He said we would watch a movie and hang out too. The movie never happened. Unfortunately, it was sort of what I expected. He was in this horrible relationship with a woman that was so bad and violent that he is now wearing a body cam. It was like 4 hours of talking about this, and then inevitably this gets me going talking about my ex too as I can't avoid it. But he goes on and on and on. I really wanted to watch a movie. My god.  I know I'm guilty of complaining about my ex too and I feel bad for him-in his case there was legal involvement.  I had to cut it off and go home because my assignment was due at midnight electronically.  I was so worn out.  Today I woke up feeling this general sense of malaise, kind of reflecting on the weekend, and realizing that the little interaction I had was kind of negative, between listening to my friend on and on, and the confrontation at church, that it was not uplifting.  There are just so few options these days.  And this is supposed to continue for another year or so? And I'm out of work. It's so overwhelming.",depression
Update: I told my boyfriend the truth,"Hi everyone. Hope you're all doing what you can.

i just wanted to post an update on the roommate situation. This weekend was weird. We went away to a local beach for the day on Saturday. Me my bf and roommate. My roommate didn't talk the whole drive there and once we got there he said he hated beaches. Why did you come then... Anyways he sulked on the beach, forgot his bipolar medication that day too:/ and ran away for an hour and we couldn't find him. Although on the surface his actions were very childish, but I have to remember he's going through mental health stuff right now too. But it doesn't excuse him for his selfish actions towards me entirely. i was upset because he almost ruined a perfect day (we invited him because we thought all 3 of us could have fun like we did before we moved in together and before he told me he had feelings for me.)

I'm lately kind of angry at him but keeping it to myself as I don't want to confront anything with him. Today I told my boyfriend that my roommate told me he had feelings for me. My boyfriend is honestly the most understanding soul I will ever probably meet.... he wasn't pissed or outraged by our roommates behavior/feelings. He was quite composed, listened, didn't get mad, understood where I was coming from, understood the boundaries we will have to draw and we're going from here. I'm not sure if he's going to confront our roommate about what he now knows but he said he respects me for respecting our roommates feelings too and knows I was put in an awkward situation. He is contemplating our living situation and telling our roommates parents because like I said, our roommate also has mental health stuff he's dealing with and he needs a support system, but I am the wrong person to be that for him if he has feelings for me that aren't going anywhere....

this cleared my conscious because I hated keeping it from my boyfriend but now I also feel guilty for spilling the beans from my roommates POV. I sincerely hope I didn't mess anything up by doing what I did but I think I did the right thing for myself at this moment in time.

Cant get past the past..,"When my depression hits I remember things from my past. Past mistakes, abuse, and humiliation. Back then I didn't have the strength to stand up for my self and now that I am older I still struggle with my self esteem. Do you know what its like to want to take back the past? Do you know what it feels like to want to be someone else? I just got out of a long term relationship that was unhealthy for me and for some reason I stayed..why?!? I am not sure. Sometimes I keep thinking I am useless and that I keep making the same mistakes. I am too nice.. and that niceness is killing me. Does anyone know what the ""nice girl syndrome"" is? its a real thing..and it a real big problem in our society. I have a lot to work on. Some people have confidence and self esteem and others just don't.

Rant about keeping in the now,"Hi everyone, I hope your all  doing well today.  I am home for the 4th day from the hospital.  I am having a hard time emotionally.  I feel like ziveant to go to sleep.  And than I push to stay here now.  Than I sometimes have been hallucinating.  It is a a little off, but I can function, however, it does concern me.  The psychiatric doctor office I gave up on.  They are still not open., you can leave a message and they say they'll call back in 24 hours, but they don""t.  My medical doctor won't prescribe psychiatric medicine without a script from the pdoc.  I am on pain killers so maybe that's why I am occasionally hallucinating.  .   Did anyone have this or have advice?",depression
One thing after another,"Hello everyone, 

I haven't been on lately I've been feeling really low these past few days with so much going on in my life. 
The situation that put the icing on the cake was hearing from a guy I use to be involved with. About a month ago I ended things with him for the millionth time but this time I stuck to it. He told me all these things about wanting to do better and be better and I believed him and things were good until I came back in town just to visit and everything we talked about went down the drain. We didn't hang out and he barely even spoke to me while we were in public with our friends. After he apparently made plans to finally make things official that weekend 

And I know what you could be thinking ""he sounds trash just forget him"" but we spent the past 3 years together and I've tried numerous times but that last time I meant it. It was almost a month since I had spoken to him, no social media and I hadn't cried over him in over a week I was very proud of myself. He messaged me a few days ago checking on my mental health there had been some sexual assault accusations made on some of our mutual friends (I'm not their friend anymore) and because I too went through something similar he wanted to check in on me. 
We talked and he brought up the message I sent him ending things for good. Saying things like ""I was ready to make it official"" ""I love you"" ""I lost a part of me when I lost you"" and it all sounded good but I didn't take him back. 2 days went by and he's texting and calling and begging and as soon as I consider giving in he told someone that we both knew that he didn't know when he would ever be in a relationship because he couldn't see himself giving his time and space to anyone else and that he just wanted to do his own thing. The thought of giving him the benefit of the doubt and he turns around and does this hurts. 
I'm hurt because I was okay without talking to him and doing better finally just for him to come back and do this. I'm upset with myself for allowing this to happen I should've never responded I don't know what I thought would be different but I feel like I took 2 steps forward and 10 steps back and it's definitely not what I needed considering my current situation. ",depression
Question about treatment/diagnoses,"Hey everyone. Hope you're doing well today. 
Working in a mental health office keeps me on my toes with resources of educational materials and information so today I was reading about trauma and PTSD. As someone who had experience childhood emotional trauma, I feel like I can relate to almost (not everything) in this book. But how accurately can I determine this? I clearly know I feel anxious and depressed quite often.
my therapist never mentioned I may have complex PTSD but I do feel that's what I experience in addition to dissociation. I also hate labeling things because I think it adds to the stigma of mental health and I don't want to feel like these diagnoses are ""mine"" as they're just a name for experiences. It's hard for me to come to terms with anything regarding my own mental health because my parents always told me nothing was wrong with me or just ignored how I felt and so it's hard for me to find out how much I relate in how how I feel with particular diagnoses. 
anyways I'm really trying to get to the root of my everyday struggles and really looking to relate with other about this because I'm sure I'm not alone but I just don't know what to do with this information for healing and recovery purposes. I just want to make sure I'm getting proper treatment and such but I know my therapist doesn't specialize in trauma therapy. Wondering if anyone else ever felt this way?",depression
Need advice,"Hi everyone. I hope you're all doing what you can to stay healthy and safe. 
I'm in need of some advice as a follow up to my post last week... I live with my boyfriend and our best friend. We just moved in together a little over a moth ago. A week into living together our roommate tells me he has feelings for me. Not just a crush but something more. He also had confided -in me and put me in a super uncomfortable position. My therapist thinks I should tell my boyfriend because it's weighing on my conscious but I also told my roommate that it could stay between us but that I do not feel the same way at all. That was me controlling the situation because I didn't know how else to react? I try to make everyone else comfortable and then everything is stewing up in my head and if I feel anxious and already depressed about myself so this tops it off just great. 
I can't help but feel like the worst partner in the world. Knowing information is dangerous and I had a panic attack last week because of all this. I want him to be honest with my boyfriend but that'll never happen. I really wanna tell my bf just so that I don't need to feel this guilty and weird. I didn't do anything wrong but just knowing how our roommate feels and not telling my bf almost feels like that issss what I'm doing wrong.

Really hurt by (former) good friend,"I only had one good friend growing up in childhood, all the way to college and beyond. After our mid-twenties, we were still good friends, but didn't really talk or hang out much because of geography and our lives were different.
Anyway, fast forward to two years ago, when we were in our mid-thirties. In many ways, that was the hardest year of my life. My younger sister was getting married that year, and it was a mess. I was so hurt by the way that my sister was treating me and my family. The guy she was marrying was terrible too, and he brought out the worst in her. I was so hurt that year and cried for an entire year. 
My friend knew I was so unhappy about this, though she didn't know the details and didn't know exactly why. She never once asked me how I was doing with this, before or after my sister's wedding.
Instead, she even went so far as to support my sister's wedding (and they're not even friends at all) by liking my sister’s Facebook posts about her wedding. 
I also think my friend was heavily judging me too. I'm not married in my mid-thirties, still live at home, and don’t have a high-paying or prestigious job - all my choices, by the way. By comparison, she's a doctor married to another doctor with three kids. I'm happy for her. But I think she judged me and my life a lot, and that HURT. 
I know my friend isn't going to change or own up to these things. I already tried with her. I accept this. I just consider her an acquaintance now. But I guess I just wanted a place here to talk about how hurt I am by her. ",depression

Desperately in Need of Help and Understanding,"Hi, I was directed here by someone from the helpline because that's where I'm at with my life. I don't even know where to begin. I went away to college in the fall of 2017 and I had an awful time, and I ended up dropping out. At the time my mom told me she would never forgive me for dropping out, I don't know if her feelings have changed or if she is still mad at me for it. In February of 2018, on my birthday, we received a letter that said our house had been foreclosed and we would have to leave. My parents both kind of shut down and I was left to pack up our entire house and help my sisters pack their rooms and we moved into a rental house that May. The landlords wouldn't allow us to bring our two cats, so I had to bring them to the SPCA and surrender them. That fall I enrolled in community college and this past December I graduated with an associate's degree in visual art. I have been looking for a job for the past year at this point (since I got my own car) and I have not been able to find anything, and I'm talking about just minimum wage stuff, McDonald's, CVS, etc. I think my parents feel like I am just a loser now that I have been out of school for a few months with no job, but I don't know how to try any harder with the way I feel. At this point, I am just completely hopeless, and I don't know how to communicate that to anyone who can help me in a way that will be taken seriously. I am just getting to that point where I am afraid because I don't know how I will ever get past this. I see nothing for myself in the future, I have run out of hope and dreams and goals, none of those things seem worth it anymore. I also feel like I can't talk to anyone in real life about these things because I will get too emotional. I can barely say hello to my parents without almost bursting into tears. I think the best word to describe how I feel is just completely broken. Recently, after about 6 years without hurting myself, I have started again because I am just running out of ways to cope with all of this (and more.) I want help, I want to say anything to anyone at this point and I want someone to help me, I need someone to take me seriously and help me.",depression

depressed or just going through too much anxiety?,"i cannot stop telling people I'm sad or depressed or very anxious and that i started taking meds for it... and everyday i panic over something different like my shortness in breath, the ringing in my ear,or my mental state, and then i cry about it. why do i i ke seeking help? this has only been going on for a week+ and i dont understand why i keep telling everyone I'm anxious and started meds",depression
did I choose to be abused??,"Ok so there are a lot of things going on.  Illness,  grief,  seperation, loss. I am pretty close to the edge.I was raised in an abusive home,  and I just found out that my dad died.  I don't know how to feel at all he was a horrible person.

My mom believes that you pick your parents before you come to earth. So according to her.....I need to figure out why I picked my father and what lesson I needed to learn from allowing myself to be born into an abusive family.  As neither she or my dad is responsible to any of the things that happened to me.  I chose it and I created it. And my pain is well according to her ""self inflicted"".
So my question is, is it my fault?  Am I completely responsible for the hell I grew up in and do they have no responsibility what so ever.  I am not a ""blamer"" but it seems very harsh and over the top that I should be blamed for their cheating and lying and abuse. For their immaturity and their hurtful treatment and their selfish acts.  
I guess that is how low and confused I am right now.....I actually think I am at fault for everything. ALthough I am seeing that I have been told that my whole life.  If I had never been born think of how great their lives would have been......has always been the underlying messge.  A good indication of why I have always felt suicidal. ",depression
Rage,So it has been awhile since i've posted here but my temper has become even shorter lately. I get enraged just by being around people or someone looking at me in the store. I enjoy staying home because I literally feel like I hate people (except those in my life who I love). I'm sure it's a part of my depression but some days I just want to be on the planet by myself! Has anyone else experienced this?,depression
coping?,"I am not sure what coping would look like, but I have to say that dealing with depression is difficult enough, and add in a pandemic that's going to radically alter life for quite a long time certainly makes it much more difficult. There is so much more to contend with. If you were facing setbacks and difficulties prior to this, then certainly now all the more. I hate to admit that when I read the timeline of how long this would go on back in March, that it would last this long and continue to do so, I was totally gobsmacked. Now that it's sinking in, I realize that this is something to adapt to.
I keep feeling guilty for not getting up really early and keeping busy all day, but I do seem to be very productive during the afternoon and evening.  I talked to my therapist about it, and it seems better if I can get to bed by/around midnight, and at least get up at ten, instead of eleven, twelve, one, or even not at all.  I just hate to get up and face more of what is going on, but it's beginning to be a familiar backdrop. During the afteroon, I do homework and a couple days a week I meet a friend in the evening to swim laps. Seems alright. Still just so tired in the AM, though. 
Yes, it's going to be tough to find a job in this environment, and even more since my last position didn't end all that well. I didn't get dismissed, but it was not the best experience, and short term. I've finally decided where I might like to go next in terms of employment, and got used to working from home for two months, so I have more experience with that. I also took an online class on contact tracing since there are supposed to be a lot of hiring in regards to that.
I still feel really nervous as I'm supposed to go to a concert tonight.  I have not been on any outing since all of this started. Except for walks with friends, and swimming outdoors with one person, I've done nothing, period. This certainly contributes to depression. Cases are really out of control in my state.  I probably should not go, I just feel like I'm out of touch with the world and reality from being home for so long. It does make me feel better that the venue has significantly limited the number of patrons who come in and people have to stand apart. Plus no food service.  I will be wearing a mask. Plus it's ventilated and the part that's sheltered is also open to the outdoors. The meetup doesn't tolerate no-shows and they might kick you off of future events if you don't come, but I have to prioritize things and pleasing other people just isn't a priority in the face of facts here.  If I feel uncomfortable I will just head out or stand outside.  
This whole thing, the distancing, the isolation, its' incredibly weird. ",depression
Stuck,"Hope noone minds if I just talk some?  I'm having this stuck feeling today, I was so good yesterday. I made a list last night for today. Well it's more than halfway through the day and I checked off just one. Every time I get up to go do something, I feel like I have this all over heavy like weight on me, more snugish in the chest. My brain jams up thinking of the to do things, and the later it gets, the more I feel guilty that I haven't done anything but watch TV and look up things on my iPad. It's beautiful outside, one would think that would inspire me to go out. Nope. I'm home alone today, maybe that's some of it? Calling someone when I get like this, a lot of times makes my head mess up worse. I know there's a reason in there somewhere just can't think of it. I'm trying to see if, by my ""saying, writing it out to the group, that I could talk myself into doing something. Like maybe Break the to do list down into smaller pieces.Like Laundry: wash, dry, fold, bring upstairs, put away.  Am I being lazy by coming up with some kind of excuse to not do something? I want and ""need"" to have these things done. I would be happy to have them done. So why aren't I doing them?  Well, there it is, my thoughts of the day.  Have a good day. ",depression
Creating a new group?,"Hello everyone! 
I hope you all are having a peaceful day.

i was thinking about creating another group, I'm still new to this site but think it would be great to start a group to be able to talk about things free of judgment and take a step back from our issues just to find small bit of peace and a moment of happiness just talking to our peers that have been giving us sick great advice so far. 
im not sure how you all may respond to this but I might just start a new one and she how it goes. You all have been so nice to be and so open and I just want to share the positives as much as I can.

let me know what you think! ",depression
Continued,"Hello Everyone, 
 I hope you all are doing as well as you can.
Just an update on my situation. My step mom asked me to come home and I apologized for whatever I said or done to upset her and I took some your advice about brushing it off and keeping my head low. I found out that she gave her boyfriends daughter my room she was staying for a few days to help pack the house (which they didn't do) and my little sister called me and told me that the room was now called the guest room. She told me I need to stay gone a few more days and that I put her in a ""tough situation"". I extended my help if she needed it to pack multiple times and she turned it down. 
it was then that I realized she told them to come help out of spite toward me and she couldn't just tell them they couldn't come. Long story short I hadn't heard from her since that day until she texted me with a very dry tone. I told her I understood if she doesn't want me back and if she just wanted life to be with her boyfriend and his kids but she never responded. 
I can't help but feel like during my time away she realized she liked it more without me there and now she regrets telling me to come home hence why she hasn't talked to me since that day and she continues to deny my help. 
But overall I'm tired of feeling bad and apologizing for something that was not my fault to begin with and I know you all are saying I should just suck it up but I've been more than trust worthy and loyal to her I just want to be happy and not feel like a burden for once in my life

Just alone,"honestly i don't know what to say at this point. or how to feel. the amount of stress, anxiety and depression that has filled within me is overwhelming. i have ever felt more alone in my life. every night i cry myself to sleep because i have no one. no one to talk to. no one to check up on me. i have no friends. i've gotten to the point where i'd rather have my old toxic friends back just so that i'm not alone. IM TIRED OF BEIGN FUCKING ALONE. IM TIRED OF EVERYBODY LEAVING. why does everyone have to leave? and why is it that when they leave they have to take a piece of my heart with them. I'll never get those pieces back. i feel unfixeable. unloveable. alone.",depression
When someone doesn’t believe you,"Hi everyone. I hope no one minds if I just write this out. 
The past 3 years I've been processing and dealing with anxiety and depression but have been living with it (in denial/unaware) almost my whole life. Recently I've come to realize that my father was a narcissist and that ruined me... I received only conditional love from him and was put down every single day of my life, called the most horrible names you could call a child, threatened, but never physically abused I must have you know however it doesn't take away from the emotional torture that words cause, especially from a parent figure. Anyways my father doesn't believe in mental health. He's more of a ""pull your bootstraps on and keep goin"" kind of man. I always tried to respect him but he always gets inside my head and I really dislike him. He never said I love you, still doesn't. He never hugged me or showed affection, only sabotaged any good environment we wound up in and brurally verbally abused my mother. Growing up was hard, but I survived. Ive been seeing a therapist now for 3 months and she really has been able to validate my feelings, experiences and lately I feel like I'm making progress towards understanding. What is self-esteem cause I don't know yet.

Sone how I end up in toxic environments and I'm sad and angry. I just moved in with my boyfriend and his best friend; we all get along really well and have very healthy relationships.... so I thought 3 months ago. As if graduating from college and moving during quarantine wasn't hard enough, two weeks after we move in he tells me that he is severely attracted to me and has a love for me that he hasn't felt since his last girlfriend tore him to pieces, literally. WHAT THE FUCK. Not even two days later, he is hospitalized for suicidal ideation/ attempt and is diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. All the while I'm processing childhood trauma, trying to be there for HIM and also really confused and pissed off that he told me, guilty because my boyfriend is truly the purest soul and doesn't deserve to be in the dark and so now what?

Fast forward 3 weeks later. I'm doing the dishes and roommate is cooking dinner, my boyfriend is working. All of a sudden my legs go numb and my heart is beating faster than I've ever felt and then there it is. The panic attack that was waiting to happen. AND THEN HE TRIES TO COMFORT ME.

Two days later here we are. I was prescribed Lexapro and today was day one. I had heart palpitations, loss of appetite, nausea and weird euphoria. I'm a mess right. How about we're ordering food and I was like nah I'm not hungry I think it's this medication maybe and roommate says ""you're on medication now? For what?"" I said I have major depression disorder and GAD (eVenmo though I've told him) and he says ""no I don't think that's what you have. In order to feel that way something has to have happened to you."" I just thought that was the most arrogant and disrespectful thing to say, especially coming from someone who was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder?

i removed myself and found this website. I'm new here and I just don't know what to do from here.... 
Thanks for listening

Getting bullied again,"Hey everyone. I was getting serverely bullied in high school before it was shut down for corona, but now that I'm getting over it I have some rando from my new college in my DMs saying the exact same crap. Inuslting my relationship, religeon, and so on. I already blocked her because who has time for that noise but I guess I just wanted to vent because it's the most I really can do. Hope you all are feeling well and supported. This has been such a helpful group for me recently <3",depression
I struggle with my lack of accomplishments.,"I know it sounds like conceit, but today and as of late i've been struggling with the fact that I know that i'm talented, bright, and an attractive person, but I haven't utilized these traits in my life, its as if i'm just wasting away, I feel worthless and guilty for not accomplishing some great thing. It leads to a lack of motivation and anger and self-hatred and bitterness. As each day goes by it's just a struggle with the fact that I was born lucky in life but i've done nothing with it. I feel absolutely worthless.",depression
Making Space?,"Hi everyone,
Hello,
I'm new to the support group and also new to depression. I've had anxiety...for about as long as I can remember, and depression runs in my family. I always (naively) believed that exercise, a positive outlook, doing good for others, loved ones and friends, meditation and making space would help protect me from depression.
I was wrong. I feel like I've been fighting it off for months, but lately it has gotten unbearably heavy through a number of losses and stressors that I can't seem to get my footing trying to handle, and I'm struggling to find a good fit with a physician or care provider in a timely manner. I'm trying my best but I can't overpower the gravity of it. 
Do any of you have advice for making space, coping, or overcoming the symptoms while I continue the search for help? My relationship, ability to concentrate on work and mental wellbeing are really hurting right now. I'm anxious because the less I can right these ships, the worse I feel - but none of my usual strengthening exercises are working for me (exercise, prayer, painting, meditation, walking outdoors).
Any advice is so appreciated, thank you!",depression
Coming to terms,"So i'm very new to this sort of thing. For as long as i can remember, i've always felt sad and out of place, and just felt like life is pointless and theres no reason for me to be here. I always felt like i needed to hold everything im feeling inside so i can be there for others when they need me. I've always felt i had to be the one to help, and never thought i would need the help. I got very good at hiding the way i feel, and never learned to open up to people, even my own family.  The past few years it's gotten worse. I've had a few rough patches with relationships and work, and it feels like the ""bottle"" is finally cracking.  Anxiety episodes are becoming more and more frequent, and there are days where i don't want to get out of bed at all.  I've had to come to the realization that i truly need help. I had to call my parents this morning and tell them that I'm suicidal and don't know what to do.  I want to get better before I ruin my current relationship and want to stop pushing peole i love away. I have no insurance so I'm not sure how to go about getting affordable counseling, so i'm hoping that i can find some sort of relief and help through here.",depression
How sick and demented and funny life is.,"So on Monday I found out that my dad died 2 yrs ago.  It is a long story.......basically he got a huge inheritance and then he got a new wife and she used his mental unstability and his strokes to help convince him that his family was not his family. She secluded him from us and would not allow us to see him or know anything about him. None of his friends or famlily know as far as I know. I did a google search on Monday that is how I found out. My dr asked me yesterday if I was loved and cherished and taken care of as a child..I just laughed.  She said that is why as an adult I can't accept things and why medication isn't working for me (I was diagnosed with c diff about 6 wks ago) I am still sick.  
It really made me realize how alone and disconnected I am (hey of course all this covid crap isn't helping with feeling loved or secure) I asked my daughter to find someplace quiet where she could talk to me  so I could tell her what I had found out about her grandfather...she was at the park with screaming kids........so of course not.......why would she even be available to me for something so monumental.  I told hubby and he gave me a hug said he loved me and went back outside to work on his project.  I haven't told a single ""real life' friend....because what the hell do they care and at best I can expect a ""wow really sorry you are going through this"" end of discussion. So now it is up to me........to tell family and friends that he died. And to decide if I should do anything about it. A memorial or just post it on facebook and so be it, or write letters or make phone calls or say nothing at all. His wife.......didn't let anyone know. No one he cared about or knew or was allowed to visit him while he was still alive.  Anyway.........my question is....no my thought is........what really matters?  family?  friends?  What makes life worth living?  Well I am alone............so is there really a point to living at all???????????????????? All of this is reinforcing that I just don't count and what the heck is the point. Honestly I don't even know why I am posting this. I don't want platitudes or cliques or false hopes. It is what it is.  I am a good person whose life sucks. And it just keeping getting worse and worse and I am sick of fighting and hoping that one day it will get better.......that one day there will be a light at the end of the tunnel, that one day someone anyone will care about me and want to put me first and love me the way I hope/think/feel that I deserve to be loved.  So anyway if anyone does read and reply to this..........please me soft and kind.......as I am on the edge of a cliff at the moment.
And no I have no intention of going on drugs and no I don't have a counsellor and no I am not going to look for one...been there done that and it has never worked for me. I just needed to vent so that I don't explode. I don't need to be fixed -- I am not broken. I just need to be heard. ",depression
Thank you,"I appreciate everyone and there kind words in regards to my last post with my step mom and our situation. I have decide I won't be going back home and doing whatever it takes to stand on my own two feet. It's really hard and I'm very sad on top of the depression that was already lingering but I know I'll get through it. 
It's been hard I've applied to over 40 jobs since I've graduated in May and still no luck but I'm still going to stay optimistic. I don't have any more hard feelings for my step mom she did the best she could and she deserves to be happy although how she went about the situation could have been better I'll always love her. 
I'm still very afraid and often feel alone so if anyone has any life advice tips tools that I could use in regards to life and living life on my own as a young woman I would really appreciate it. ",depression
"Yep, I depressed, DUH,","Depression just totally sucks the life out of you. Period the end. Add in stress, anxiety, mental/physical health issues, not as close to family as I use to be, and just a couple of friends, throw in a 29yr marriage that has been on shaky ground for at least 10 of them and now in a state of ambivalence.

New to this,"Hello everyone, 
my name is Ashley and I'm very new to this site, I hope everyone is having a good morning/night so far. I recently graduated college and moved back home with my step mom who has now decided she wants a life without me. There were very harsh words thrown at me all the time and it seemed like she only wanted me there to help with my little sister who I've baisically been taking care of since I moved back home. Yesterday after an argument I decided to pack my things and try life on my own. I know she would let me come back home if I needed to but I've been told to get out so many times I'm not sure if it's worth it. I feel very alone and scared although I've been away to college I had a great support system there. But now that I've moved back home I have no one, my friends and don't know much about my life back home and when I finally told them they were t very supportive of me and I don't have any other family that I could turn to. (It's been like that a majority of my life). 
I apologize if this message triggers anyone, like I said I'm new to this. I'm just trying to find some peace of mind in all of this, I know eventually I'll be okay I just feel so many different emotions  just 2 months ago I was in school with a job my own place to stay and friends and now I have no job staying on a couch at my god brother's and no one to talk to. 
Maybe it's for the best. ",depression

I just can’t eat.,"I am new here.
For the last two weeks or so I have been unable to consume more than about 400 calories a day. It's not that I don't want to eat, I just feel very ill if I try to. I have some extra pounds, so I'm not in immediate physical danger. Obviously this is making it so that I have a complete lack of energy, which then makes it hard to do the things that could pull me out of the funk.
Now I'm getting stressed about not being able to eat, which adds to the depression and anxiety.
My main relationship is in turmoil, and a beloved pet went missing all at the same time.
I do have a few very good friends, but only a couple of them are local. I feel like a burden if I unload my troubles to my friends (and I don't want me or my partner to be judged).
I have been meditating, doing what I am able to physically, and I start therapy this week (which is worrisome financially). Does anyone have any other coping mechanisms they can recommend?
Thank-you.",depression

So much on my mind depression& anger,"In April,2019 my 9year old daughter disclosed that her grandpa**Not biological**(my husbands dad) had been touching her private area,this happened at her grandparents house,while i was working she told her dad and my husband being a protective parent confronted his father which denied it of course the coward that he is, the grandfather charged at my daughter ready to put hands on her,my husband pushed him back and thats when i arrived confused as so much yelling and screaming i immediately took my 3 kids away from that situation as i didnt know what was happening after securing them in the car i asked my oldest what happened and she then told me,  i then called the police to report it,since the beginning i knew this wasnt going to be taken serious, cops came and only took our information down and told us a detective will contact us on Monday(we reported Friday night) Monday came and nothing, I had to call and ask what was happening(tuesday) set us up for interviews at amberlys place, my daughter was traumatized, it broke me down dramatically, my daughter would hide behind me or my husband when any adult male came near, from family strangers coworkers, so when the interview took place it was a male investigator that took our case and interviewed my daughter in a tiny room alone, i was called to stand behind my daughter in the interview room as she refused to talk without her parents there which i was told i can not talk what so ever only hold her, this room was so small that the chairs facing eachother (one for my daughter one for detective) where less than 3feet apart when sitting knees could be touched from how close this was, for a child having to go through what she went through this was unprofessional, well my daughter went on to a fetal position and cried she said her grandpa touched her in her front private under her underwear and then she shut down not one other word came out nor did she repeat herself, my daughter did not talk to me for about two days after that interview as she said why i made her tell a police(detective) what happened to her, shes embarrassed, i had to put her to counseling as my baby only 9years old told me she wish she was dead because of what her grandpa did to her, she said why did it have to happened to her, our lives have changed dramatically my once outgoing extremely energized daughter turned sad and depressed and isolating, weeks go by i called almost everyday to get updates and i am sure i annoyed them but i wasnt going to let this go unnoticed, it finally came 2months later that the grandfather was interviewed he denied it completely they offered him a polygraph and shocking he agreed, after the polygraph was given they took him back to interview for the results, the detective told him he failed miserably, grandpa still denied it, he was told multiple times the numbers(test) dont lie and he stuck with it never happened he read the results to him all his personal or generic questions he answered correctly but once the question involved my daughter or sexual intentions he failed, he was told he was free to go and the grandpa asked "" I can leave?"" ""Can i move out of state?"" detective told him he can do what he wants he has not been charged but cant tell him anything else, i received call from detective and was told about his results and i asked if he was arrested or charged detective told me no i asked why not you got proof he told me a polygraph cant be used in court and they can not press chargest as he did not admitt to the assault, and because my daughter did not want to talk(to a male man after the trama she been through) there was nothing else they can do, i went to detective supervisor, i wrote emails to other agencies and so on and after everyone telling me nothing they can do,to just let go and move on????? Really so just pretend my daughter never got touched just forget that the man is out there free possibly doing it to others and no punishment for his actions?? Well here we are a little over a year later and it still hurts as it just happened i still struggle with my depressed now 10year old wishing she was dead while this pig is out there enjoying his fucken life and not one ounce of guilt what he did...i do have video copies of the interviews and reports but unfortunately even now my daughter will not talk nor would i force her. but i think it should of been handled differently maybe a female detective from the beginning maybe more concern of this situation, all i want is some type of justice for my daughter without having to traumatize her and have her talk to more people about her situation...i have so much different feelings going through my head just dont know how to handle things its soo hard, the fear of loosing a child because of what someone did to them, i comfort my daughter so much and give her what she wants but i can still see depression in her and that kills me inside, i myself 27yrs old am suicidal i deal with alot of mental depression and this just made it worse i have to fight my self to stay strong and here for my kids, i was raped at 16yrs old and got pregnant with my now 10year old daughter, so this fucks me up more the fact that i protected them so much to make sure what happened to me never happeneds to them and as a mother i failed because now my baby is going through something similar",depression
Not Doing Good,"It's been a long time since I've been on here. I bet back then things seemed like they couldn't get any worse, but I kept going on to see what would happen. 
I've had good days and bad days in the past and always seem to be able to bounce myself back. Now it's only bad days and I can't seem to get myself back. I don't think things could feel any worse. I have so much hatred inside for myself that it's spilling out. I'm getting angry at people, and it's ruining the only thing I have left. 
I've never wanted to die before, there was always something I hung onto, but now those things seem more unimportant. It's all downhill from here I just don't want to wait and see what happens any more.

so furious,"I just need to vent.  I feel really sad and angry. It's been three months now since the breakup and I really should have been over this sooner, but I'm just not.  I still obsess, but not as much.  One of my friends said 'well at least he was honest when you guys broke up."" But that's just it. I don't think he was actually honest. He said the reason he couldn't be in a relationship was because his business was failing and he had to parent his son part time, and thus did not have the time or the money for dates. Yet, the singles group that we were in has opened back up after the quarantine.  Still, coronavirus is spreading and the absence of lockdown doesn't change that.  He has signed up for every event, both paid and non paid.  Spending money on dinner and brunch, and gets on the list for everything. This is the same person that told me that he was avoiding me and cancelling our plans because, ""he was ashamed of the fact and circumstance of his failing business and that he could not even make his car payment, and that he wished he could show me a good time and couldn't.""  And this wasn't because of me. He is out there at least weekly, maybe four nights a week (he used to say that he didn't have time, either, because he had to work these evenings) Going and spending money at restaurants. The same guy that could not make his car payment. He has also started his own meetup group on line for spiritual people, and he has everything listed on there that they can do-hikes, restaurants, etc. They are even meeting at a bar (this is the guy that says he doesn't drink).  All of these things and more-he claimed he was 'an introvert' and couldn't meet my friends. An introvert? A person who starts his own meetup and goes to social events nightly in the middle of the coronavirus??  Really?

I'm so mad I can't even see straight. Unlike what my friend claimed, I don't think he was honest. In fact I think he was the total opposite. He also told me his divorce was going to be finalized in February and hinted we could move forward.  I called the court and as of a week ago it's still not finalized and just sitting there. To make matters worse, I think his ex actually joined the same singles meetup. What really pisses me off is that I don't feel like I can go to any of these events when this virus dies down-because he is there all the time!  I really like the group and would like to be able to get out. Why does he have to be there constantly!!! I don't like feeling like he wins. I hate him I think he is such a hypocrite, a liar and a loser. I also think he probably doesn't' have any actual friends at all and so has to go to public events. I think he's alienated everyone. He's such an ass!!!  I hate that I feel depressed, sleep way too much and want to cry all the time. He told me he didn't want to be the cause of me feeling this way. Well it's too late! I sleep most of the day to avoid the horrible depression I feel most of the time and want to cry constantly. My therapist said after my insurance runs out she can't see me anymore. ",depression
anxiety and depressed?,"I have been in my new job for a month. I got let go at the old job due to reorganization.
I never had a commute but now I do. The drive is over two hours a day but the drive doesn’t have much traffic overall.
Everyone is nice but I don’t make friends easily and these people tend to stay to themselves. I’m not sure if making a friend or just being more comfortable over time would help.
I work in a space where I can’t have my phone and I have no windows and this gives me a lot of anxiety too. I’ve never worked in a space like this.
I used to work from home full time and now I have to go into work each day. I’m no adapting well to that.
Honestly there is nothing really bad about the job overall from the outside looking in. It is better from every aspect I’m told but I am struggling very badly and I don’t think the commute, being without my phone, and feeling alone, lonely, and trapped are helping. I mentally feel trapped everyday. I’m not sure how to get past this and feel better I know I won’t be in this job forever but I don’t know how long until I find something I prefer to do and has maybe some work from home option.
I am looking for other jobs but I needed a job so I took the first one I got offered. I think I would freak out with any job. I’m an introvert and a 6 on the enneagram so anxiety is just terrible for my personality type. Life is a struggle.
I do have a therapist but I just feel I’m still not making any progress anywhere right now. I’m going crazy.
I feel the same mainly everyday whether I’m at work or the weekends at home…the anxiety is there for the job… I’m not sleeping well…I have bathrooms issues due to the anxiety and nausea..I can’t seem to enjoy much of anything…I feel lost
I guess I’m just looking for help. but I don’t know if I can be helped or thrive. Breathing doesn’t seem to help calm me. Distractions can’t work at work. They are only temporary at home.
I’m not on medication of any kind.
Anyone have similar experience and / or what helped you?",depression
getting so tired of this,"From a selfish perspective, I am so tired of all the constant chaos going on.  The quarantine was exhausting in and of itself.  I was starting to deal with it, though. Breakup, job loss, the whole thing all at once.  Our state was just beginning to open up and I was starting to resume some normal life, was not feeling nearly as bad, got to do some of my usual things. Got together with a friend for about the first time in nearly three months. Yes, that isolated.  Everyone is too terrified to leave the house.
Was just getting ready tonight to see another friend tonight that I haven't seen in many months, and guess what-we have to cancel-not because of a quarantine but because of rioting in my city. Can't even go on a walk in the park because of a curfew. G**damit. It is always something! It's like every time I turn around, I have to run and scramble and cancel my plans. I was in the the thrift store shopping for the first time in forever, and the clerk announces, ""we are closing because the governor has announced a state of emergency."" I'm thinking, ""on top on the emergency we already have?""

Lisa completely ignores, doesnt even acknowledge that im there and she glares at me too sometimes.. I've wanted to go up to her and ask if she hates me.. i usually try and look at both sides to see if I did something wrong.. idk if what's been going on is affecting her or that we have to close in Jan (long story short the place we are renting from has asked us to find another place by Jan of next year) however she is laughing and talking to the other people who work there.. so Idk what i did or if something snapped inside her idk but I can't do this anymore.. it hurts and I've cried so much.. when I go on my breaks I just cry.. also my boss and lisa her daughter are always changing the rules every single day.. one day it will be this and than the next it will be completely different and we'll get in trouble.. i have a really good friend who is a support worker that comes in to work with one of the kids and she has helped me a lot, always giving me advice about child but my boss talked to me on Friday about planning for the kids and she told me not tell my friend anything and that I have all of planning in my head and that I can do this is myself.. what happened to working as team? They are pushing us away from each other and we both knew this would happen... also communication is terrible there too, they don't tell me really anything and ill get into trouble for something I should've known.. like there was this project that lisa did with pinecones and soil.. there was a mess on the table like with soil and moss... im like that must be her project and when we messes we need to clean it up.. but not with lisa.. i over heard her talking about it and she said oh it should've been finished all last week but no one did it and i was the only one who did it.. ill say this she never once asked if we could do what she was doing.. than as I was taking stuff out for the kids to do since it was raining my boss was like you need to clean this up before you bring stuff out! So if i left this out I would get into trouble and I would clean it up anyways.. however if its lisa or my boss they never clean up their mess.. im just done and I want to leave, however the only problem is what's been going on with covid I dont think its the right time to leave however I cant stay here till Jan.. ",depression
Relationship Help,"Hey everyone,
This is my first time posting and tbh I never wanted to get help, but it's gotten to the point where I just can't function and be happy anymore. The reason I'm asking for help is because my gf of almost 2 years just broke up with me and it was absolutely all my fault. Looking back at it I treated her absolutely horrible in every way. I always use to consider myself a good person, but after all I did to her I don't think I can ever love myself again. I constantly made her feel like she wasn't enough and I constantly put my girl best friend in front of her and made her feel like she wasn't good enough. I told her things that made her self conscious about her body and I even lied to her constantly, but the worst thing I ever did to her was flirt with a random girl so I would feel popular and cool and that’s considered cheating. I broke her trust, I broke her heart and the feelings she once had for me are destroyed. Tbh I could keep on talking forever about all the things I wish I could have done differently, but that’s never going to fix what I did. The worst part is I loved her more then anything in this world and for some reason I still did those things to her. Why would I do those things if I truly loved her? I’m so angry, disappointed and disgusted with myself and because of this I feel the need to punish myself. She wants to stay somewhat friends and nothing else, but I want more then that and it’s killing me inside. We use to hangout ever single day and now I’m lucky if she texts me once a day. I’ve tried extremely hard to move on, but I just can’t I really can’t. I don’t know if this DS thing will help me, but I’m out of options. Recently I’ve had extreme depression, anxiety and I’ve started having suicidal thoughts. I don’t have anyone that I can talk to for help so I have to ask my ex and that just hurts her even more. Should I just stay friends with her or should I block her and hope she decides to come back to me? I’m so sad and depressed all the time because I had the dream girl, but because I was selfish and Inconsiderate I pushed her away and now she’s probably gone for good.",depression
Depressed and lonely during Covid pandemic,"This is my first time to write on here. I am so tired of staying in my small apartment.  I am 66, live alone with my cat and am so lonely I could cry.  I have been, actually.  Have depression, too.  Anyone else out there  in the same boat?  If I didn't have my cat to talk to and pet and do not know what I would do.  I do not know how much more of this I can take.  But no point in saying that, because I have to take it.  I do not go anywhere, afraid to get the virus.  Of course, I had depression and loneliness before the virus, but it is worse now.  I cannot go into work.  Working from home at this time.  Glad I have that, I get to talk to people.  Have a few friends I talk to and a psychologist I can call when needed.  But really, now, this is too much.  Any words of wisdom, and anything that has helped you to deal with this bizarre situation we are end, I would appreciate the feedback.  Thanks, Chloe",depression
Road to Emotional Idenpendency,"Hello Everyone,
I feel as if my depression has worsened  2019 and currently 2020. Especially these past few months I have been overthinking way too much about little arguments with my family and boyfriend. I feel as if I have become emotionally dependent. I feel as if I have no value, and I have developed a fear of being hurt, I live in constant fear that I will experience something traumatic that will leave to me emotionally and mentally scarred. Honestly, all I do is sit in my room half of the day and cry staring at the ceiling. I feel as if I'm drowning in a pool of water. I can't take scary scenarios out of my head. I try to preoccupy myself with things I like doing, but sometimes It doesn't help for long. This is my first time posting something. I don't think anyone around me can understand or help me. I want to learn how to become emotionally independent and value myself again. ",depression

Hanging by a thread,I've been so depressed today. I just feel like not being here or waking up and trying the day over. Everything hot me so hard today. I feel like no one is here for me. I mean really who do I have I have no friends and no family. The only reason im here is because of my kids. That's the only thing that's keeps me going anymore. I realized today that I'm a single mom and it's getting to me for real. Im very lonly now I have no one to talk to or just watch a movie I have no one and it's so depressing. I can't get it out of my head that no one wants to be around me and do I really blame them woth how depressed I am. I talked to my therapist about and she thought it would be a good idea for me to be in these support groups. So here I am depressed more then ever and feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. ,depression

Struggling to find a purpose in life,"I'm struggling mightily and I am at a loss. I'm posting this as a reach out to some folks that may have similar things going on as a support system. To be honest this post could fall under a number of different groups. 

I'm just going to put out a number of things and am hoping that some folks would reach out with additional questions to keep up a back and forth conversation to try and develop some clarity.

Here are some facts, not all of them right now, I'm not sure anyone would want to read the whole thing.

1.) Male -- Age 49 -- Married 20+ years (possibly not for long) 3 grown children. 6 grandchildren 

2.) I grew up in a family that did not show a lot of affection which has transitioned into my adult life. 

3.) I am bi-polar, but taking medication that does really seem to help.

4.) Out of the Big 5 personality traits, I am highly neurotic (I've just come to realize this in the past week or so after reading about it. I thought neurotic behavior was just something that happened under stressful situations, not something that rules daily life) & introverted (but not because I don't like hanging around people, I just have esteem issues I think.)

5.) My predictive index shows me to also lack patience and be highly competitive. 

6.) I'm not physically abusive or violent, but do go through swings of mental abuse. The mental abuse is not something that I do vindictively or consciously, but the end result is the same. I've stole a good part of her personality and soul. 

7.) I'm a little bit more than controlling, not in an evil way, but its kind of like ""It's needs to be my way or I will either try and change it to my way or sabatoge the invent somehow by mooping around and having a negative attitude.

8.) I believe I am in the throws of an ""Existential Crisis"" for probably 4 years or so. Triggered by changes in management at my last job, whereas the new manager started to devalue a lot of the accomplishments of many of us that had been at the company for many years. In my case 17 of the 30 years. Secondly, our last child graduated from high school and became an ""adult."" 

9.) I drank everyday, for the past 4 years as a coping mechinism, not what I would call an alcoholic, but kind of just something to do and somewhere to hang out with people and my wife. (The local bars)

10.) I'm aware that I am not a bad person, but one that has been a jealous, controlling person that has difficulty living in the now. I evaluate things for potential ""problems"" instead of looking at things for the joy they are. My impatience causes my mind to think ahead to the next thing, giving little time to enjoy things for what they are.

11.) I am desperate to change, I hate myself and not just because of the pain I've inflicted on my wife.

I thought I was doing okay,"I thought that I could push through without talking about it, I thought it would be okay to just let it pass and not confide in anyone. That's always the person I've been: quiet, hardworking, eager to help others, an attentive listener. Uncomplaining. But it's starting to become so much harder now. I feel myself pushing away those around me and curling up into myself because it feels safer there, and less painful. I know this isolation isn't healthy, but I don't know who to reach out to anymore or even how to put it all into words. My body just aches all the time and I'm so exhausted, and everytime someone tells me to stop looking so depressed and bored, I do my best to lock it away inside myself. If someone has advice about breaking free from this isolation and the best steps to take to reach out to others, I would be very grateful. It helps even to think that maybe someone out there is listening, and can empathize with my experience. I'm trying everyday to find joy in the small, simple, beautiful things in my life, but I'm afraid it's becoming more difficult to identify them as the days continue. I hope that someday I can find and fully appreciate those little moments again, and feel the same as I did before all this began.

Ex girlfriend addiction and gaslighting,"I don't now where to start.  My last relationship I was with her for almost 5 years.  I knew her for 6 years. I didn't date her for a year knowing of her upbringing and her never dealing with it with professional help and I knew she was a drinker. She's a sweet person sober but her vice was alcohol.  We started dating and she eventually moved in with me.  Hiding liquor by the pool or behind the toilet in the upstairs bathroom, etc.  Long story short, she drank daily.  At work redbulls and vodka.. came home buzzed daily or lit.  Story of her coming home from work and it was 6-6:30PM and calling me saying some guy is on her hood.  I was on the phone with her and waiting for her outside, she only worked 10 min from the house.  I asked her should I call the cops (All I knew was some guy was on her hood).  Well she pulls up in the driveway and 5 cop cars pull up behind her with their lights on.  Well that guy who was supposedly on her hood was a female cop. She was arrested on DUI that night. This continued througout our relationship, the daily lies, denial, deflect, blame, pick a fight with me so she could get a hotel for the weekend to drink.  I pleaded with her family about her situation.  Then it became physical one weekend while I was driving.  Cops were called and thank god they knew.  Cops been called before and on record knew about her alcohol abuse.  I'm a big guy and she no marks on her but I had marks on me.  
You get the gist.. This was honestly daily.  And I admit I was weak, she would use sex to apologize.  But after she hit me I knew something had to be done.  I pleaded with her family who lived in AZ and TN.  I knew when I didn't want her sex even it was over for me.  She slept on the couch for months, and lied of course to her family saying I hit her and keep in mind the cops were called by her that weekend she she claimed that to them.  I was totally coherrent to the cops that evening and she was lit out of her mind and no marks on her but I had sevel from defending myself and trying to hold her while I was driving.  

6 months later I 9 of her family came and got her things and took her to TN.  I was elated then.  
But since she has left I have felt down, what could I had done differently, I trust no one and honestly do not even want to leave my house except for work.  I used to be so outgoing and fun.  Now I just want to keep to myself.. I don't want to deal with people and bullshit, etc.  

Gaslighting is no joke, hearing, ""Rob, it's all in your head daily"" knowing I knew the truth.  I would video the fridge/freezer before I left work of the liquor and she would deny it when she got home or when I got home.  I would show her the video before and after w time stamps and she would still deny it.  
She's been in TN and still texts me, ""I love you"" etc.. Given this girl was molested by her dad for 10-11 years and raped by her best friends boyfriend before we dated but I knew her.  I was the one who called the cops for her 6 months later when she told me.  

I don't how to shake this or what.

I need some stability and support in my life that I can count on.  Everything seems to be falling apart and I can't handle that.  I am thinking of retiring in a month or less due to my mental and physical state.  Although it will be very bad financially I think it is what I have to do.  My job is absolutely toxic right now.  horrifically abusive supervisor, very unsafe work environment, my body continues to break down.  I'm practically shaking with anxiety and fear right now as I type this.
If I could end my life I would.  I would have done it a long time ago.  It's not that I don't appreciate life, I do.  But the pain and hardship that has come along with my life is getting unbearable.  I'm in so much pain right now, I just need it to stop.  I don't care how.

Being Essential has been Debilitating,"Hello all,
As I believe it may have for many of you, this pandemic has taken a toll on my mental health. While I may only be 21, I've been diagnosed with severe clinical depression since I was 12 years old. I've been medicated for it, and it had been working, as far as I can tell, until this pandemic hit. The job I currently have was considered essential from the beginning, and due to the mass demands for the products we sell (I work at a grocery store), I've been working 8+ hours every single day to help my community. I know without question that this has had a negative impact on my mental health and my depression, and the medicine just doesn't feel like it's doing anything anymore. My boyfriend, who I met at this job, has been working similar shifts, and I can tell it's been hitting him hard as well. Seeing the light in his eyes flicker in and out when we're at work is heartbreaking, and it hurts me even more to know that he's going through what I am. Working 8 or more hours a day for the past 2 and half months has been debilitating, and I'm afraid that when everything ""goes back to normal"", I won't. I have no idea what to do, but I'm trying my hardest to keep going, for both my boyfriend and I. ",depression

Feeling Lost and Hopeless,"Hello everyone, I'm new here and I'm not very good about coming out and asking for help or putting myself out there to maybe get advice. 
I know that this whole COVID fiasco has a lot of people in tough places and it's affecting so many people. But, it's affected my relationship more than anything else.
Sorry, I'm bad at this. My problems with depresssion have been with me for a long time, since I was just a kid. I think on my mom's side there is a history of depression and other mental issues, and no I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but I know it's a problem. So much has happened and so much I can't remember to know where it started, but looking at things and I think it all started with me. I've always felt weak and like I had to be careful. I was born with athsma and I had developed exima when I was just a baby, I suffer from allergies to animals and plants etc. We had horses, cats, a dog and later alpacas so whenever I wanted to do anything with them I would always break out, I learned to deal with it and just do it anyway, but it's always bothered me that I couldn't just go hug my horse without feeling like I had to itch my skin off afterwards. Being asthmatic on top of it made me limited on how far I could run and how long I could play and what activities I could and couldn't do. 
On top of already having issues being able to do what I wanted, I later in life injured my knee and became even more limited for years. When I finally got enrolled in school (my mom beleived in home schooling) it wasn't until the seventh grade and I was an outcast, I didn't fit in with anyone for the longest time and when I did finally find a group, it was my fellow outcasts (which I am not throwing any marks against them), so we were all made fun of etc/, and I lacked the social skills needed for such an envrionment which made it all worse. My siblings were always getting better grades than me, my older sister being a Sophmore and my younger in 4th, setting standards for the high school teachers and then exceeding expectations in jr high. My high school teachers never said it, but I knew they were disappointed that I didn't live up to what my older sister had set for the family name, and it hurt. I did however do well in my English calss and eventually got to an honors class in it, but that became an even harder challenge after I recieved a concussion and almost no longer understand the material. In here at some point my parents seperated and wouldn't get deveorced for almost 12 or so years, we were forced out of our home in the dead of winter (born and raised there, lived 17 years at the place) so we had te get rid of all our animals, find a place to move, and go to school. It was a very hard and traumatic couple of months. None of us have been the same since, I feel that my life has just degraded since. 
I got my first boyfriend after we moved and was with him for 4 years before I had the guts to get out of the abusive situation. After about two years I had moved in with him in our own apartment and his true colors came out. In 2 years he managed to rip me down to the point where I was never happy and couldn't feel any light inside. I used to spend hours writing or drawing but lost all desire to do so. My fire, who I was, had all been extinguished. I'm still trying to recover from it all, working on rekindling everything. 
I some times think not everything would seem so bad if life wouldn't just slap me down. Every time I get settled somewhere I'm knocked out with a painful reminder that I'm insignificant. My first job was working as a salesclerk and I quit after having a six month battle with my reinjured knee and them refusing to pay workman's for it when it had happened at the job. I got fired from my second job for standing up for myself and my cowrokers, and lost my third job due to a shoulder injury that I am currently dealing with that prevents me from being able to do anything some times.  I have such a nasty feeling that I am on a timer, one that is quickly running out. I've felt for a long time, with how weak and unstable my body is that I have a limited window in which I can go out and work. Every time I turn around there is something wrong with my body or it's getting worse and preventing me from being able to do things. I thought I was pregnant last September, the most sure I had been about anything in my life, and I wasn't. I just KNEW that I was, but there wasn't anything. But from that I have gained a lot of weight and can't seem to get rid of it, and have been left with doubts about my fertility or ability to bear children, always having felt that I have an extremely short window for that too. 
With having everything turning upside down all the time and no friends, other than some online I play games with, I'm always stuck at home with nothing to do all day and get bored of what little I find to do. I've gotten to the point where I can't motivate myself to even take care of myself. I only take a shower or brush my teeth if I have an appointment or go to see my family. And while I'm trying to deal with myself, I'm also having to support my loving boyfriend who has issues and when put in a lock down situation starts talking dark and getting mad at little things that people do that would never have been a problem before, like using a blinker in a roundabout. I don't feel like I have time for me, but when I am given time, I can't bring myself to do anything to make it better.
I know this was a ramble and I'm sorry, I just feel so helpless and some times hopeless and with not being able to motivate myself and the constant and increasing failing of my body I just don't know what to do and I feel like there is nothing I can do, that I'm doomed to stay weak and falling apart, doomed to sit here and watch it happen. I feel like I've lost all control and that I have nowhere to go and nothing I can do.",depression

How Can I Seek Help?,"Hi all, this is my first post here.
I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for about two years now, ever since I graduated from high school and entered college. It's been a highly stressful, confusing, and lonely time period for me, and I know a lot of college students struggle with similar feelings. A part of me believes that seeking professional help could be beneficial, but I fear how my family would view this, so I am generally afraid to bring it up to them. They seem to believe that the best way to combat depression and anxiety is to keep busy and distract myself with school and work. But, it's becoming more difficult to stay engaged and keep up with these things, due to how I am right now. Could anyone provide some advice about seeking help when the people in your life still seem to stigmatize and avoid conversations surrounding mental illness? Are there accessible, cost-effective resources I could pursue on my own?
Thanks all,
E.R.L.",depression

A distraction for tonight,"I've been looking for distractions for my suicidal thoughts and came across this video. I was feeling very sad and it's a sweet video. I cried so hard I almost threw up watching it. Thought I'd share. (SGN with John Krasinski)

Merely Existing,"It's been nearly five months since my wife moved out, nearly three since any employment prospects dried up, and two since the entire world went into isolation. At 51, this is the most difficult time I've ever experianced in life. I'm completely and totally alone, and the worst part about it is that I feel powerless to pull myself out of it. I would love to go to work everyday and socialize with co-workers, like most other people can, but there's no jobs available that I can physically do. I would love to go out to a casino, or the movies, or the park, or even a singles bar to try and meet people, but they're all closed and social distancing has turned into the norm. I feel completely helpless to learn, grow, and recover from the multitude of terrible events that landslided over me. How can a mind and soul heal when the means of attaining recovery and healing are simply unavailable? I sit in this house alone all day, all week, all month, a home that used to be full of life and family. I watch other people sequestered as well, but most have family and friends and are getting through it as a group. I envy them. I have been in this state since mid-January, and I see no prospects of hope at all. In fact, I predict more suffering to befall me soon (perhaps that's paranoia). I am now merely existing and watching the world move on without me. I don't think any of you can give me advice I haven't already heard or thought of before, I just wanted you guys to know about it, I suppose. I hope everyone is doing the best they can out there.       ",depression
I Hate This *Trigger Warning*,"This will probably trigger and offend a bunch of people... I really don't care. I am so sick of everything at this point-- I had COVID-19-like symptoms starting Saturday so my doctor ordered testing for me and told me to isolate for 10 days. It has sucked on a major level. I haven't been able to leave my apartment, even to get mail and even though my test results came back negative, the RN I spoke with said that although it's likely I don't have COVID-19, the results aren't 100% accurate and, based on the symptoms I had, they want to play it safe and still keep me home. I haven't been able to go to work (I work in a pharmacy, so no working from home for me) and I am so scared I will not get the position I am applying for there because of this, even with the doctor's note and proof that I got tested on Monday for COVID. I fucking hate Denver-- it is filled with pot-smoking yuppies and rich hippies and I am sick of it. It is expensive and pretentions and absolutely nothing like it was when I used to visit my family here in the 90s; hell, it's nothing like it was when I first moved to CO in 2013. I fucking hate people. Furthermore, I'm getting the nomadic urge to relocate again; I want to move to some rural town in the middle of nowhere that no one's ever heard of and live in a box lol. Unfortunately, I am stuck here for a few years. I am very depressed about coronavirus, probably like a lot of people are. Thank you China, for spreading your fucking virus to us, and thank you Trump for being an ass (as usual) and not acting appropriately or in time to effectively handle it. I am abiding by the safer-at-home orders, practicing social distancing (or at least I was when I wasn't in isolation), and wearing face masks when out in public, and I will continue to do so. But I miss the days when I could sit at a table at my favorite coffee shop and draw. I miss swimming. I miss meeting my friends for lunch and catching up with them. I am sick of being cooped up at home. I am sick of Denver. I am sick of everything.",depression
really don't know what to do,"I honestly don't know what to say about everything, I am mostly at my wits end given all that is going on. Things were touch and go prior to the pandemic, but now I feel that they have in a way gone from bad to worse. The pre existing problems that I was dealing with are basically still there, but now there is this extra added problem of the economy and that it will be harder to get jobs.  
So, the end of my teaching contract came up. It's basically been fifteen years of extreme difficulty with this career, in a few different jobs, and now with not even being able to be in the school (we were distance learning, which was OK) I feel like I'm adrift. To sum up, the past few years-before I was at a job I liked- but there was so much politics, etc. that I left, which was sad because I liked the job and was there  for a good while. I had really good recommendations, etc, and they wanted me to come back. I didn't because there was a really angry guy there who was making all of our lives hell.  It was too much. It was extremely hard to get another job-I didn't get the right fit right away. Lots of interviews and no one bit.  I finally did, and and spent the last nine months or so in an also bad situation, working in an impoverished area that was violent. One kid brought a loaded gun to my class, which I narrowly escaped (we all did) I had pics of me put on the internet without my knowledge...just a mess. A couple of my classes just absolutely refused to accept me as their new teacher/authority (their other one passed away) so I was never really able to establish a foothold. I was planning to go elsewhere, anyway, and then we went to distance learning.
Fast forward a couple of months. My boyfriend dumps me, the pandemic happens (in this order) and now my contract is up. It's the end of the year and I will need to look again. I've emailed both my admins to ask for a reference letter-no reply from either-this obviously means no. I've never not been able to get at least one letter. I know that the year was a difficult one, but there were a lot of factors involved and I don't know if all of them were related to me. It seems like with the way the circumstance is, it's just more evidence that it's time to move on from this fraught career. I just don't think it's fair at all when you work super hard, drive super far, and just try your best to do what you need to do and get treated like****. At least that's what I feel right now.  I don't feel I did anything really wrong in the position. I delivered the instruction, students resented me trying to keep some order. I don't know what else to say. Aren't they supposed to cooperate and not make your life a living hell in the process and interfere with your delivering instruction?  A ""friend"" of mine, when I was talking to her, just went off on me when I told her what was going on-saying it was just hard to watch all my anxiety and that I 'overreact to everything."" Overreact? This is a pretty bad situation (the pandemic) as situations go. She told me to ""take supplements,"" and that she was ""pissed off at me for a whole year."" She is/was studying to be a life coach and wanted to practice on me-no thanks. How can you put people down or go off on them right now? There is so much going on.
It was hard enough having the person I loved just walk away from me, then we were on lockdown, and now no job too? WTH?

Should I cancel my therapist?,"I am seeing two therapists at the moment.
One, let's call him Zack, I see him for free once a week.
The other, lets call her Mary, is paid and I'm seeing her once every 3 weeks, and also going to paid group therapy run by her every week.
Mary's sessions are targeted at addiction, handling the root causes, and underlying trauma. She's very good.
Zack, well, you get what you pay for...
He seems preoccupied at times... Not the best listener, nor too understanding. He made me so angrilly depressed today. He said some things, which maybe are true, but maybe could have been said with more tact... He also told me to be a man... Lol.... I dont know.... I am thinking very strongly to drop him, but I have mixed emotions about doing so.
On the one hand he is someone I can talk to, and he seems to be giving me ""fatherly"" advice...IE He is encouraging me to get my act together...And also gave me decent advice in dealing with a love interest. However, the last 3 times we spoke I felt quite worse about myself, and this last time very much so.
I don't think confronting him about it would be very fruitfull. I am thinking about just dropping him. If I do so, I think I'd be releived, but also I think I'd feel a bit guilty. Like maybe he could have helped if I'd given it more of a shot.

I'm not okay,"I feel like there is no one I can turn to about how I've been struggling lately so I found this site online.  I don't know if I've just gotten in my own head, going quarrentine crazy, or if my depression has worsened but I don't feel right and I'm so tired of it.  I've taken an antidepressant for probably 5 years or more now and I've never felt this low.  I'm a single mom, now working from home and trying to homeschool and entertain my very active ADHD son.  In the last week I've had 1 good day and the rest have mostly been sleeping and napping.  I feel like a horrible mother because my son spends a lot of time alone. Since the quarrentine there's no where to go. Before, we had something going on all the time and were never home. Now we've been stuck at home for 2 months.  I don't want to do anything. I've run out of clean clothes before I finally did laundry last week.  I don't get dishes washed until we're out of utensils, and I have one clean towel in the whole house.  This is not me.  I am in no way OCD, but I'm very overwhelmed.  I haven't been getting much work done either because I just don't feel like doing anything.  I'm struggling at home, with work, as a mom, and I've become very paranoid in the relationship I'm in because my mate doesn't talk or text me daily like he used to.  He says he's sorry for being distant and I know he's struggling with his 3 kids at home and trying to get them to do their school work, but I still feel like I don't matter, which I've made him aware of.  I just don't know what to do.  Usually I get in a funk it might be a day or two, but I've never felt this hopeless before.  I do not see a counselor, although I would love to, but I don't have health insurance so I can't afford the cost of office visits.  My usual spiritual uplifting methods or coping methods are not helping.  I'm so tired, but also tired of feeling like this. ",depression

And it is contagious.......so now I can't even go near hubby at all. To top it all off I just bought a brand new laptop, that is broken. I can send it to another province to get fixed or I can return it. There are no other laptops that are the equivelant that can replace it.  Not anywhere. I have to get my corporate paperwork done in the next 2 wks. And it could take weeks for the computer to come back to me.  Literally to call anywhere to get help or information means being on hold for hours. I think that I am going to lose my mind. With everything that is going on with the Corona and with work and with hubby's injury and not having anyone to talk to and really not having much human contact in weeks. This is all just too much........way way way too much. ",depression

Quarantined with Parents,"I've been in quarantine with my parents for about two months now and am beginning to find it extremely difficult. My parents' marriage has been over for a long time now.

I feel caught in the middle, trying to make peace between them when that's not my role. But since none of us can go out anywhere I just want some kind of calm in the house instead of constant tension. I am in search of a job and hoping to move out soon, but am concerned for how my parents will get along if/when I leave. I know at a certain point I need to move on and live my own life but its hard when I love them both very much and just want them to be happy.

And I am being tested for COVID-19 today because I've been exhibiting symptoms, and I haven't told her yet because a) she will freak out and b) after that she'll make it all about her and how worried she is about me. It just seems like, ever since she retired, she's lost all control. And she's become very self-righteous in the process.

I feel like I have always had anxiety even as a youth but the other diagnosis occurred after my daughter past away in 2011. Since my daughter died I have (or felt like I have) ruined my life.. I slept around so much and didn't always protect myself, drank entirely too much, betrayed friends by of course- sleeping with their exes, did not take care of my body what so ever and at one point I was even a ""sugar baby"" or whatever they call it now. That was probably my lowest. I only did it once, felt disgusted and wanted to kill my self. None of this is who I am. I didn't seek help to get diagnosed until 2016 and even then I didn't stick with it. My mental health spiraled until the last incident I mentioned, it was last year and that was my breaking point. I have been on medicine since and taking care of myself the best way I can. However my problem is, I can't let the past go. I literally hate myself and what I did. I feel disgusted and unworthy of anything. Sometimes I will just start crying out of no where. I can't believe the things I did and how I put myself, my body, my health at risk time and time again.

Hi,"hi, i'm not really good at reaching out to people, but it's gotten to a point where I'm literally self-destructing.
I'm generally the kid who always gets perfect grades without studying much, because I have great memory when I pay attention, but this past month or so I've been failing and getting literal zeroes in pre-uni calculus and data management. I have 3 offers from really good unis, but I feel completely overwhelmed more than excited (a lo-behold family members who shame me for being stressed out rather than excited for 'a new chapter of my life' cause you're not getting any younger, eh?). I'm completely burnt-out and feel like screaming whenever my teacher speaks in my online class, like an awful minute-long rage that results in feeling like you've just drank cement for the next few hours, similar to an awful mini panic attack. I've been dealing with my abusive mom turning everyone on me to repair my relationship with her by playing the victim card, stalking me online and stealing my photos and invading my privacy and posting fake heartfelt captions under them that result in many of her friends and co workers pressuring me and shaming me for running away from home, but she's not the least of my worries (they sound like a lot when I type them out, but it's more or less been the same thing for almost 4 years now). The only reason she can't stalk me irl is because I been living alone abroad since I was 14, but now with the quarantine, having 5 roommates who are extremely noisy only adds to my stress and I just feel like shouting and generally being violent when I hear someone talk (so irritable I really hate myself right now). My father's girlfriend has been trying some stuff behind my back, generally being critical of me and soiling me in family gatherings (accounts of my grandma. I'm not close to my father at all because he is completely emotionally unavailable, but still depend on him financially which is stressful cause he's never been reliable in the least) and from past experience, I fear that the small support I get from him in the form of finances will fade very soon. I do go to therapy, but I don't feel like it's helping and I'm just in a constant cycle of perfectionism, self-hatred, self-criticism, guilt and a constant burn-out. I have no idea how to deal with everything anymore when I'm a 17 year-old being forced to make decisions that are meant for people 3 times my age like my parents.

The Past still hurts...,"I was in an abusive relationship 5 years ago. It was followed by stalking and only last year did he finally leave me alone. I dont know if I ever truly healed from that.

Now fast forward some years, I am still stuck in something that doesn't feel complete. My ex hurt me so bad that it made me scared and depressed. However, now I have someone that won't actually commit to me. So I dont feel enough. I have had relationships with people on two different sides. One who was controlling/abusive and one who doesn't love me enough. A couple months ago, I got in an argument with the guy I'm dating and I had a full panic attack, rushed to the hospital. Sometimes if we get in a little argument, I flinch. He has never hurt me but I feel like my past was so bad it is ruining what I have now and that's why he won't commit. He always hugs me and says please stop flinching but I can't help it. I have days where I don't know what's wrong with me and I just cry until I can sleep. I get overwhelmed with work and school and just want to sleep. I want to be able to have a successful relationship but sometimes I can't get out of my funk. Sometimes it causes me to be mean and sometimes it causes me to sleep my day away. I feel alone and feel like no one wants to hear my issues or cares because they didnt go through it. Honestly, I can easily put on a poker face when I am out and about and just smile as if nothing is wrong. Truth is, I have been hurting for a long time.

Suggestions please.,"Hello all,

With this craziness and being home alone I have been trying all kinds of things to help ease my depression and anxiety. There is an abundance of content on youtube and I was wondering what may help ease this awful feeling. I have watched a lot of Jason Stevenson, some Tibetin/meditation and mindfulness, RAM DAS and host of other postings. Today I found Mindful Movement which has mutiple videos on meditation. I feel that the availibility of this viewing is wonderful and I was wondering if anyone else has subscribed to these channels. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I was feeling really panicked two weeks ago and wanted to harm myself and I reached out to my friend who I’ve had for 13 years. I’ve been there for her when she felt suicidal, when her dad died, when her husband had a sex addiction, when she was thinking of divorce. I even went to her sex addiction anonymous group with her. She was my best friend for my first few years of college. We have been friends all this time and we got into one awkward conversation when I confronted her and saw she was going on a trip to Vegas with all of her girlfriends, over a year ago. I told her it makes me sad that she only has time to grab coffee with me and has to pencil me in on her calendar months in advance, but I see that she’s always going above and beyond for her other friends and sometimes it makes me feel like she doesn’t care about me. I would always invite her to dinner or to my parties and she would always decline. She specifically wanted to get coffee and only that. And it just made me sad. On top of that she also didn’t invite me to her wedding but she would talk about her wedding in front of me and it made me sad, and then every time I saw her it would be like a therapy session and she would unload these incredibly heavy things on me but then not include me in any other way in her life. So I brought up these things to her and I guess she must have felt attacked and decided not to talk to me. I told her that I feel that she comes to me only when she needs to vent and talk about heavy things and it makes me feel disposable because I try to be close with her and I don’t know how when I just see her for a 20 minute coffee every three months. Anyway, I contacted her like a month later and profusely apologized and told her that I was sorry and she said it wasn’t a big deal and forgave me. Since that awkward conversation we have gotten coffee again, we had sushi, she even told me she wanted to go dancing with me and plan a trip together and she was sending me weight loss tips and inspirational quotes. So I contacted her two weeks ago because I hadn’t heard from her for a long time and I was worried but I was also starting to feel suicidal and I needed someone to talk to and I felt she understood me because she’s felt that way too. I texted her and tried calling her multiple times and she ignored me for three days and it started reinforcing my feelings of abandonment and feeling unloved. I started texting her saying please call me I’m not in a good place right now and I feel like I did something wrong, I see that you’re online, maybe you changed your number. I’ve been trying to reach you it would mean a lot to me if you could please call me. If I did something wrong I would really appreciate it if you could let me know and I will take full ownership. She literally completely ignored me, for no reason. I hadn’t heard from her for two weeks. Yesterday I reached out again and she texts me and goes, I talked about you to my therapists and numerous other people and even journaled about you and I realized that our friendship wasn’t something I was into to begin with and wasn’t really interested in anyway so it made it really hard for me to want to see you or spend time with you. I realized that every time I saw you I felt like a shitty person because you’re so nice and you’ve been there for me and you’re always so kind and saying the sweetest things but I  don’t want to be in this friendship anymore because it makes me feel like a bad friend.  And she was like I’ve been thinking about this for months, And I’m sorry to myself that I forced myself to be in a friendship for your sake when I really wasn’t into it, and I should have been more honest with myself. And then she tells me that up until I contacted her today she thought of still being my friend and having a “light” friendship but because I contacted her today, she’s changed her mind and doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. I tried to text her a few more times apologizing and saying that I want to make things right and that this really triggers my feelings of abandonment and it makes me so confused and unloved because she never indicated that there was ever any problem, and it’s incredibly painful for me and I don’t understand where this is coming from because she literally asked me to go on a trip with her and we got sushi and she kept saying how grateful she was for me and she continued opening up to me about getting a divorce and sharing all these heavy things. I had no idea she didn’t have any desire to be my friend. I felt like she just strung me along believing everything was ok, and then out of nowhere she decides to completely ignore me and not talk to me anymore especially during a moment of need when I was suffering and so upset. Her then only response to my emotional and vulnerable texts was was “Youre too much for me, I’m working right now” I just literally cried for eight hours. I couldn’t stop crying. I woke up this morning crying. I don’t understand. Everything was fine and we were hanging out and texting each other positive things and then she just decides that she doesn’t want anything to do with me and tells me that she’s felt this way for months but didn’t want to admit it to herself and only hung out with me because she saw how much I wanted to hang out with her and she did it for my sake. She made me feel like it was ok to trust her and talk to her as she had to me about her struggles and I come to her one day begging for her to call me for three days and even when I am suffering like on the verge suicide she completely ignores me. And I contacted her yesterday saying that I don’t understand what happened and why she won’t talk to me and it makes me so sad and I’ve tried in every way to reach her, and confessed that I hadnt been doing well and was feeling suicidal and I came to her because I missed her and trusted her and wanted to talk and she was like yeah I didn’t want to talk to you. Like I could be dead right now and she wouldn’t fucking care. She just responds with, I had my reasons for not wanting to talk to you, I don’t want to be your friend anymore, you make me feel like a bad friend and I’m not really into this friendship and wasn’t to begin with. How does someone talk to someone who is hurting so much in that way, during a pandemic, and when that person says they have felt suicidal? She didn’t care how I felt at all she talked to me like I was a pest, like I was a nuisance. Like “leave me alone I’m busy you’re interfering with my boundaries stop talking I’m working” kind of way. I don’t understand. I feel like I’m just going to lose everyone I was so excited to have her in my life and for her to be making these efforts to see me and I realized it was all a lie. I try so hard to be a good person. I try so fucking hard and I give and give and give and do everything for others when they are in pain. Why does this keep happening to me? What did I do that was so terrible??",depression

Unhappy or unhealthy associations/how to let go,"Hi everyone, I need to ask for opinions and how other people deal with unhappy associations.  I have been in acquaintance with a woman from church for 11 years.  She likes to be a leader, and restarted a prayer group.  I have been in the group and stopped a few times.  Lately, with more stress we are all dealing with, she has been harder for me to be with.  I don't feel we are really equals because she is a leader.  I have started to limit association with her.  Not because she likes to be a leader, but because she has made comments in past that have offended or rubbed me the wrong way.  Tomorrow I will see her, but for a mutually helpful activity.  I can probably deal with that, however, she is giving or her way of being a Christian is helping out.  She knows I don't drive and offered to take me to my relatives house to leave off some supplies.  This sounds all very nice, but I don't like it because she made comments in past how she gets invited a lot of places and her dghtr gets invited  a lot of places.  By the tone of voice and the attitude, she came across like she was trying to put herself up as so popular.  I just don't feel that comfortable taking anything from her with her attitude.  Another time she came across to me  to try to self praise and put herself up that she enjoys herself a lot.  This comment came out of nowhere.  Unfortunately, I told her I get depressed at one time and I think this might have something to do with it.  She came across as I'm a big success because I enjoy myself.  So I don't tell her anything personal anymore.  Other people have confided to me they don't like some of her words and actions either.  My therapist said just go with her and don't think about too much and enjoy it.  It just I don't feel comfortable letting her give a ride to my relatives.  Than she can say  after all I did for Bluebird, etc. ",depression
Peace,I wish you all peace.  A deep calming breath.  A feeling of being ok.  I just wanted to express that because I know a lot of people on here are suffering and I hope you get a break soon.  ,depression
Getting  help,"I am not sure if its just me but every time  I  want to get help for my problems or even  talking to someone  I know,  my brain  immediately  puts up barriers.

Will things get better?,"April was really tough for me. Easter with my divorced parents, my grandma, and my stepmom was really awkward. I stayed at my mom's for about a week after Easter and during that time, my younger brother fractured his ankle. I had to help him out with stuff and my older brother hardly did anything to help and usually ignored me and my younger brother. After that, I was starting to get a really bad cold. On April 24th, I went to the ER for chest pain, and that was when I tested positive for Covid-19. Luckily, I started to feel better after 5 days of bad chest pain. I am able to go outside again as long as I wear a mask and gloves at all times.
This all happened in the span of 3 weeks. To be honest, I feel uneasy about this new month. I dread what is going to happen next. After finally getting the good news that I am able to go outside again, I am bracing myself for the other shoe to drop. I'm probably feeling paranoid, but after everything that happened last month...
I'm trying to take my mind off of things by trying to focus on school work but either my mind wanders or the neighbors keep being too loud. I don't know how much more I can take before having a breakdown.",depression

So I'm new to this,"I'm 33 going on 34 yrs old and I have battling depression since before I was 14, which is when I officially got diagnosed. I don't know how any of this works or if this will even work but I'm here to give it a try. I am really good at bottling up things and not so good at dealing and it's crazy how I just came to this realization. The recent situation that has brought me back to my depression is that I had a third miscarriage end of January and I thought I accepted it but do you ever really except that a piece of you died? There was a heartbeat and it was so strong and she was so active and then one day she wasn't and there wasn't. I don't have any living children and my only wish in this life is to be a mom and for some reason it keeps getting taken away from me... why? What's wrong with me? I'm sorry for the vent, I needed to get that out. I don't even know if this is going to work but I have to try something before I slip too far down this rabbit hole.",depression
I feel incapacitated,"Hi everyone.
I haven't been on this site for a long time, but I'm really suffering right now. I feel like my depression and anxiety have taken over me to the point where I can no longer function. When I'm not working I sleep all day. When I am working as I have been from home recently, I feel like every little thing takes all of my energy. When the work day is over I just lay here like a corpse. I have a dog that I can't take care of anymore because I can't walk him and give him the exercise and love that he deserves. I wasn't always this way. I'm 29. I have a masters degree. I used to be an overachiever who had a 4.0 GPA and wanted to succeed in everything. I went to film school, I studied art. I used to play the guitar and worked doing photography which I loved. I was creative. There are many factors that have made me this way, although I have had severe anxiety from an early age. A lot of it had to do with my appearance (and still does), but I remember staying home and hiding because of my acne and just feeling like I was repulsive. If someone saw me without makeup I would have a full on panic attack. I would be late all the time to anything because I had to try to look and feel perfect. My anxiety and depression came from maybe wanting control when I didn't have any. I had an on and off eating disorder throughout my life, I had fallouts with many many people. I was raped when I was 15. I have been physically and emotionally abused by my twin brother my whole life, and my mom emotionally abused me and always made me feel like I was ugly, crazy, selfish or not good enough. I also have had two suicides in my family - my grandpa and my uncle. I lose sight of all of my trauma sometimes, but what brings me the most pain is what I have done to myself. I blame myself for all of my relationships failing and all of my friendships failing. I truly feel so alone and insignificant. I feel like now I have little to no friends, and have often thought that if I died tomorrow it wouldn't make a difference. I feel like I've hit rock bottom and that I don't have anyone. I can't talk to my family either because they constantly bring me pain. I feel completely unlovable. I don't think I'll find love again. I am so crippled by this pain of being all alone that I just don't have energy to better myself. I think, why work out, why take care of myself, why even shower if I'm all alone? Who am I even doing this for? So I have let myself go. I literally just sleep, let my dog out to pee, eat and work. This is by the way one of the longest standing jobs I have had, there have been so many that I have abruptly left because of my mental state. Although I am able to work now, I am barely capable. There have been many times where I just left and ended up going into treatment. In regards to treatment - I have been once to inpatient and twice to outpatient. As you can see, it hasn't worked. I don't know what to do next. I don't think going into treatment again will help me. I've thought of suicide so many times. I live in my own filth, I don't take care of myself, I don't feel like I have anything. My own dog by the way bites me constantly. I feel like everywhere I turn there is pain. So I stay alive but barely, and just sleep and barely function. I don't feel like there is hope or reason to get better if I will be all alone with nothing anyway. I don't know what to do anymore. ",depression
Feeling off,"I'm not depressed at the moment but I feel it trying to rear it's ugly head. I've been feeling off all day at work and I ordered togo for dinner even though I should be eating at home. Yet, I feel down so I opened the curtains in my bedroom to let the light shine in. We'll see. Fighting depression is so hard!",depression
Hurt,"I'm not sure what I expect or hope to get from posting but I have so much hurt that's been building up for years I don't know what else to do. I'm in such a dark place I can't get out of. I'm having suicidal thoughts to just get released from this and have been cutting myself to focus on that which helps.
i was in an abusive marriage which ended a long time ago and I've never had the confidence to be in a relationship since. So there's no confusion in this situation, I am a guy, my abuser was my wife. Soon after marriage it started and steadily got worse, which was verbally, mentally and physically. Over the years she broke me, made me believe I was absolutely useless. I was often hit, kicked, scratched and pinched and she  got me to believe it was always my fault she did, and I always apologized for making her do it. Eventually the marriage ended which was many years ago now but I can't get over how worthless I still feel. A few months ago I lost my dad and maybe that contributing to some of what's going through my head, I don't know. 
i keep having problems of hyperventilating and uncontrollable sobbing and crying and just can't stop it I don't know what to do. Writing this I'm crying. And feel so totally lonely of no value. I don't think there are any answers, and not expecting or hoping for then writing now, sometimes I just so desperately desperately need a hug but have no one to turn to.

Very down,"You when you have depression, you know there are all these different levels and ways of experiencing it.  I'm usually just down and sometimes I am physically incapacitated by it, sometimes it makes me kind of manic, sometimes i feel sad and lonely and then there's the really bad stuff.  the one i am going through now is the kind that is a deep sadness and hopeless that kind of feels like someone just punched you in the gut and you are on your knees on the ground feeling completely hollow and stranded by the pain, unable to find a reason to keep going into the abyss.  I don't know if that makes sense.  it's just the kind where you feel really alone and can't get traction with anything in life to keep going forward.  it's that feeling that you feel that no one else has ever felt the way you do before, completely unconnected, unloved...i want to keep moving forward but but i feel like i've got the wind knocked out of me.  i think it's a combination of a lot of hard things going on all at once.  i feel so alone and so scared and so helpless.  a person needs a reason to live and to keep going.  i person needs other people who care about them.  i feel like knocking on someones door and saying please hug me, please love me, please cre about me and spend time with me and please let me know you will always be there for me for the rest of my life whenever i need you.  and i can't do that and i don't know how to get that and i feel really really lost.  ",depression

people really get me mad sometimes,"This quarantine has made depression really return.  It's been a huge struggle not to just burst out crying all of the time. I got into a virtual support group yesterday and it helped a lot.  I was feeling a whole lot better at the end of it, and was finally calming down.  Called someone I haven't talked to in a while.  The person called back, late, (kind of a distant acquaintance) and went off on me.  It really pissed me off. I think people who like to 'tell the truth,' that you ""JUST NEED TO HEAR THE TRUTH,"" Are a lot of times just arrogant. Not that I don't respect the person's opinion.  
I was in a support group that was based on 'truth telling,' which is fine some of the time.  (I keep thinking of Jack Nicholson ""You can't handle the truth!""  This person is training to be a life coach and I think needed some guinea pigs (me) so she was coaching over the phone. But, I think, sometimes relationships from support groups, etc. get really codependent.  She called me back and got really pissed off at me. She told me that all the time that we had been talking that she was not honest with me and that she had been pissed off at me because I did not do something that she suggested a year ago.  We don't even talk that much, once every couple months. But the convos are kind of involved.
Apparently she sent me a text a year ago and I didn't follow this ""suggestion.""  Her voice was kind of raised, and she said that ""listening to me and my experiences is hard to watch.""  OK, so I am thinking in my head-why are you offering to practice on me as a life coach for your certification-you certainly don't seem to have a lot of patience. And now you call me to tell me you've resented it the whole time?  The ""suggestion"" was for me to get a genetic test (like that is not expensive, and it's elective) to see if I have the 'anxiety gene,' and that I can take vitamin supplements for this anxiety gene.  (She took this test and takes the supplements.)  She has a masters in genetics, but she is not my psychiatrist. I do believe in supplements, etc.  Obviously, depression has genetic and medical components, but she said she was tired of listening to me ""spin and spin and spin."" This is one of my issues, rumination gets me sometimes. 
She seems to think this is a magic bullet. I know these things help; when I was hospitalized I had a blood test and it revealed severe vitamin deficiency and they gave me shots. But, this woman is not my doctor and I don't appreciate her calling me back at almost ten o clock at night to tell me she's been ""pissed off at me for a year,"" (her words) and why didn't I save her text.  All this time she seemed to not mind helping me out with life challenges-isn't that what coaches do and what she wanted experience with? I went from relaxing (which is hard now that I gave up my mmj card) to all upset after she called.  It was kind of a shock. So vitamins will cure me?? I'm sure they will help but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  I've had a couple of people who were formerly in this 'support group' go totally off on me, raise their voice at me, and talk down to me. Who the **** do they think they are?",depression
Fide Up,"It's hard to explain to people that sometimes hard being so called happy isn't easiest thing to do. I wake up, my partner is gone to work. I'm alone, tried walking it doesn't work anymore. Home alone for hours, watching tv, phone just not enough. My minds starts to wonder which is not a positive way. Sometimes I wonder how long can that living like this. ",depression
I don’t feel okay.,"I really didn't think I'd end up here again after 9 years of bliss, but a lot of things can happen in 9 years, like abandonment, domestic violence which led to a agonizing divorce, the loss of a close friend, all of which makes my depression far worse than it was to begin with. As of now, I can't even think positively about my life which is what helped me get out of this never ending hole in the first place.",depression
Why am I so alone?,"I know that the lockdowns are hard on everyone. But long before these even started i was lonely. Honestly before this virus started the only difference for me was i could go to the gym. I've had no less contact than before.
My best friend has distanced himself over the past couple of years and it seems that it's always me chasing contact. I get a couple of replies every few weeks, even after i told him i was suffering with depression. There's some family i try to keep in contact with but get the same. 
I try to help them and be there for them but it's all one way and gets harder and harder to bother.
I consider my self a good person. I bake for charity, go to conservation sites for my holidays, plant trees locally, I have my cousin the money for my uncle's headstone cause it was eating him up.. I don't get why nobody seems to care, why im so easy to out to the side and forget about.
It gets harder to pick myself up each time and happens more often. I've been let down by so many people and now the few i still care about are doing the same.I'm not sure I can take it.

A Step in the wrong direction,"You know sometime I'd like to think I'm a know it all and I know I'm not. I guess that it's sometimes just too late to change. I havent always been the brightest girl in my family. Neither the favorite what... but what I will tell you, and this is all based on how I have felt for as long I can remember is that I have felt like the black sheep. The child that always makes mistakes and fucks up (excuse my language). I just feel like I've never been able to get anything right and when I finally feel like I am moving in the right direction or somewhat certain ... I'm always pulled back to the reality that I have always felt to be real and yet again disappointed everyone I've ever know; my mom,  my dad, my sisters, my grandparents, and list can go on and on but most importantly myself. I've never just listened to what anyone has told me and I am finally listen but I am listening a little too late. I've burned my bridge as my mother says. And she is right I have I fucked up big time. And now I have to deal with it. So to get to the situation and I am so embarrassed to say ... I havent been the cleanest person when it comes to my living space. I for a long time would leave cups and plates with food crust in my room for months at a time and I would just get so complacent and lazy with them being there that I would forget that they were there. And then I would eventually get in trouble by my parents... and that's kinda of the situation now except for the fact that I'm older living in my grandparents house left a plate and a fork in my draw totally forgot about it and my grandparent went through my draw and I felt violated I felt that it was an invasion of my privacy and I wrote a note and put them in every single one of my drawers and they got very upset and now I am in this situation and feel horrible all at the same time and I understand how they feel ... but I'm also kinda bug that my feelings arent seen ... so all I can really do is sit and take it and not share my emotions I feel and ha e felt powerless and I can totally understand why. So any advice anyone can give me. I mean hopefully it will put my mind and feelings at ease.",depression

A question about the mind of an abuser,"This has been bugging me for ages, and I couldn't find many answers online so thought I'd ask all of you.
Okay, I'm a victim of violent crimes; unbelievably, I have been assaulted by a violent female doctor, attacked by a teacher in two one-to-one lessons, and been sexually abused by a male doctor. I was a minor when two of these happened so I bottled them up for over ten years. When I finally report these abusers to police, the police make excuses for my abusers and bully/undermine me. These abusers carry on working.  So then my mental health gets worse on top of the PTSD I already had.  Totally disgusting, right?
My question isn't about me (because now, years later, I've had 3 types of therapy and finally I'm doing better) - it's about the minds of my abusers. In wanting to abuse (in their minds), then they see a patient/student who they sense is vulnerable (who perhaps just entered the room), then they step the mark and physically/sexually abuse them (and it's easy for them to do this too). *In committing this kind of sick-minded abuse what is the abuser doing to their own mind/mental health?*  Surely they must be destroying their soul (which was once good), and then they go home to their partner/family pretending to be a wonderful person (living a lie)?
I am curious to know what you all think. It's hard to know for sure because we are good people, so we don't have the mind-set of an abuser. Someone once told me that abusers are totally ""black"" on the inside because of what they've done.
Thanks in advance

"really bad day, maybe not a bad life","Hi there, 
I'm having a tough time recently, today in particular. I'm new here, never done an anonymous support group like this, but I've always wanted to try it, just never had the courage I suppose. I've struggled with major depressive episodes since I was a young child. Some years were better than others. Some years, quite a bit worse. I usually see a therapist regularly and try to take good care of myself, but this month has been so hard. I know this time with the pandemic is hard on everyone. I feel a heavy sadness. A sadness that makes me want to crawl under the covers and lay motionless for a few weeks. Some days I want to eat everything, other days I want to feel as physically empty on the inside as I do emotionally. My thoughts spin out of control, down a deep, dark, rabbit hole.
This year has been up and down.  I was living with my girlfriend for most of the year but the relationship kept getting worse and worse. More and more fighting. Our values just didn't align, I wasn't happy. I don't think she was happy either, but it felt like she was so scared of losing me, that she would never say she was unhappy. I had wanted to leave for so long but I just couldn't work myself up to do it. About a month ago I started having dreams about leaving, about being on my own, having more freedom, not being tied down. I didn't say anything outright to her, but she could pick up on the energy between us; it had changed. She would question me, tell me to leave if I was going to leave, then beg me to stay. Back and forth, over and over. It was such a dreadful cycle. I would decide I was leaving, then a huge raging, tearful fight would convince me to stay. I couldn't stand to see her so hurt. I felt like the worst human alive. Like I was hurting such a good person. Why couldn't I love her as faithfully as she loved me?
I finally left. She said she didn't want to be home while I prepared to leave and she walked out the door and down the street. I packed everything as best in a half hour I could and said goodbye to the cats. I got in the car. As soon as I was on the highway, the phone starting going off. Call after call after call. I pulled over at a rest stop and called her back. She was losing it, but I was feeling a mixture of guilt and relief. She begged and begged me to turn around. I couldn't bear to hear her like that I was so worried she would do something rash. So I told her it was temporary, just a short break, I would text her when I made it back to my parents. I wanted to end things then, but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't rip the bandaid off. 
It's been a few weeks at my parents. I still talk to her everyday, usually just texts. She asked me to promise her that I won't ""ghost"" her. I felt like I owed her that. But I think she thinks that I'm coming back. I know she's praying I do. She texts me every morning and every night. She tells me all the things she's doing that I've asked her to do months ago. She's trying to open up to me and fix everything. And I wobble back and forth over and over. One day I'm going to write her a letter and explain my feelings, then the next day I miss her and change my mind. 
I haven't lived with my family like this in over 7 years. The last time I was here we didn't get along well. They didn't accept my girlfriend, I think they were thrilled I was leaving. But I feel like I have no one here to talk to. Ah, I don't know, I feel so sad today. I heard a family member say something negative about me on the phone in the other room today. That kind of pushed me over the edge. I finally was able to cry a little. I did get outside this afternoon, the sun is out where I live. That helped. I just feel so alone this evening. If you have read to this point I really appreciate you reading, I hope you all are well and carrying on through the pandemic. ",depression
Curiosity killed the cat,"I wonder. I wonder what people think when they look at me. I wonder what people say when I am not around. And I only wonder because I know what I would see. What I would say. And maybe it's because I feel my pain now that I would know what to say or what I would see. I walk around and see my sister everywhere I go. I can't help but question my grandparents who have never met her who never made an effort to get to know her, as to why they would have a shrine of her with pictures of memories that burn evrytime i look at them. I wonder sometimes why am i still walking this earth without her and i know its a selfish thought but i only wonder. ",depression

Depression,"So I don't know where to even begin. This week I have felt like a stranger in my own home. I feel like a roommate to my partner. I feel unheard and ignored. I have tried communicating my needs in the past, and it goes well for about a month or so. But then I do something that seems to irritate and he tends to talk at me in a degrading manner that makes me not want to try anymore. I love this man with all my heart, but I just don't know why I feel this way. I've tried coping skills, I feel like an imposter at work, I have no motivation to try anymore and I feel defeated before I even try to communicate because from past experiences I don't see a point in trying. Does anyone has experience like this with their partner?",depression
Sad rant,"I know i'm lucky.. I got diagnosed this year, which is really early on. but why is it that I can't be happy?

I feel hopeless and so alone. why me? why is it that no matter how hard I try I can't be happy I'm trying so hard. I really am. But i keep thinking and thinking.. I feel like such a failure to me and my parents. I've managed to lose myself and I can't find me anymore. The worst part is that It's on me. I have nothing to blame it on anymore..it's just me. I cut again for the first time in a long time.. and the worst part is that I liked it. I'm so miserable and I can't seem to help myself.  My parents have tried so hard..and i can't get better. Which makes it worse because I feel like it""s all my fault..and maybe it is. I feel so alone..and lost. My future seems...blank right now..I'm strong I know I am. I can keep fighting all the pain and urges to cut. I can fight all of it. but i'm so tired. I really wanna rest now, why can't I be okay enough to rest? I don't wanna fight anymore.

My actions have cost me the life I loved,"Not sure if this is the right topi for this group, but my actions have sent me into an emotional tail spin of depression. I have a sex addiction that recently caused me to get arrested. This made my wife of 20 years file for divorce, put a temp restraining order on me, and force only supervised visitation of my kids (please keep in mind I have never done anything physical against my wife or kids). My addiction was for prostitutes and other women. Now my wife is pushing away and asking our friends to help her out with our house and the kids, this just pushes me further into my depression. I have tried to give her space, but with the kids it is hard. Today she called me to walk her through some things on the house. When we couldn't do over the phone i told her I could come to the house and walk her through it. She instead called my best friend to come over to help.
This mad me mad and hurt, I lashed out a bit at her only to have to apologize for my actions. She only talks to me on her terms and it is usally about the divorce, finances, or the kids. I don't know how to win her back and I don't know how to pull myself back up. I am seeing a therapist, psychitrist, and SA group meetings. But I can't get what I have done to her and the kids out of my head, I would do anything to go back and start over. It has been 6 weeks since this all happened, 6 weeks since I had to detox off prescription meds (which were keeping me from feeling anything), and my emotons are all over the place. I am trying to focus on changing, but it is so hard to stay focused with everything going on. i am not sure how to move forward or to get my family back. Any help please!",depression
depressed,"Been find it so difficult to be happy over anything, right now am going through a very serious hard time been lonely for a very long time get no one to share any of my feelings with. now dealing with major depression and anxiety disorder, feeling so tired of life but i just have to keep pushing my self going its hasn't been easy for me and i just feels like giving up everyday.",depression
im not in control,"I talked to my therapist today. It wasn't great. The conversation just made me feel even worse. I was trying to explain myself but its hard to explain when I really don't know what's wrong with me. I feel empty inside and I just can't explain why. my therapist said it is my choice to continue to feel horrible or do something about it. I don't feel like I have control. I feel stuck and it's impossible to break myself free. How can I look on the bright side when I can't see any light. I can list all I want in my head things that are good but I won't feel anything. A list like 1. I have a family. 2. I have friends 3. I'm not a mistake 4. I am loved etc..... 
Saying those things, thinking of those things won't make a difference when I feel the way I do. It makes me feel even worse. 
Maybe I do have some control. maybe I can make myself feel happy and positive when I feel like shit and I want to die. it just feels so impossible. I am not deeply depressed right now but I'm almost at that point. I don't want to kill myself but I think about it. I think about it a lot. I think about how my family and friends might respond when they hear I killed myself. I think about what might happen when I am on the other side. But I won't do it. I believe in God. I go to church. I'm afraid of what God would think of me giving up. I don't want him to be disappointed with me. 
I'm frustrated. I am annoyed with my therapist. she thinks it's so easy just to snap out of it. Just to stop being depressed. I would if I could but I can't. I'm too tired. I'm so frustrated with her. she thinks I'm soooo strong and soooo smart. she doesn't see me or I don't see myself. but I'm so annoyed with her telling me this all the time. I'm so frustrated with her. It seems like she doesn't even care. maybe I'm not understanding something. its hard for me to think straight when I'm like this. It's JUST SO FUCKING HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW!! I just wish I wasn't scared than I could just disappear already. 
I'm sorry I'm not what I should be. I'm weak and I just don't care. Idk what I'm trying to say anymore.

Really melting down-trigger,"It's been a long road recovering from clinical depression.  I used to have it very badly and was hospitalized. When I was dealing with the throes of domestic violence, and then later economic recession, were my two worst bouts of it. Almost did not make it out.  Suicide attempts will do that.
This current situation is pushing me to my limits. I'm not even sure why.  I made an emergency appoinmtment and my dr. will call me tomorrow for a phone appointment. I think it's sinking in just how badly people are going to be affected by this crisis and all of the collateral damage. I worry about people still in domestic violence situations-now it's going to be really hard to leave. How about people going hungry, or losing someone to this terrible thing?  It kills me to think about it.
Every little thing is a huge massive effort. I can't buy clothes as all those non essential stores are closed.  I need some clothes. You can't touch anything, and the gloves are so hard to get on and off. Forced to deal with tech all the time now, frequently it doesn't work.  Nothing seems to go smoothly. In pain due to back issues-but treatment for that is non-essential, so stay in pain. No gym to go work it out, so I sit here except for daily walks. Shortly, it wil be 110 in the desert-what then?
My therapist told me to watch funny movies as of our last appointment, when I was just 'meh."" So I did. Something about that overtunred the apple cart. After laughing hysterically for half an hour, something about all that laughter seemed to shake me loose-I started sobbing uncontrollably.  I didn't realize just how depressed I must have been; maybe I was numb?
I cried most of the way through the weekend. I can't even play my keyboard without crying. Trying to master a song that I can play for people remotely-was fine until I hit a certain part of a beatles song, that just hit me, the part about people being broken hearted. Cried all the way through a virtual remote meeting with the video off.  Just seeing all of these colleagues. Cried like crazy over feeling like I just can hardly do the job from my house now. I don't understand a lot of the remote tech skills or how to apply them yet. This has got to stop, because I can't even work remotely if I'm clinically depressed. I can't sleep at night and just barely make it on time to my home office. Even that's awkward; I'm not set up for it, so there are papers and shit everywhere.  I need an Actual office in the house-it's in the kitchen now.  Nearly totally missed a meeting today. Woke up at ten and suddenly realized I had a meeting at eleven.  I could have blown it completely.  Why? I was sick with a sore throat and got over it.   I personally am in one piece and OK.
I had quite an altercation with someone on the phone today regarding a bill.  I don't know that it was even that big a deal, but we actually got into a shouting match. And yes I was being difficult, but did that warrant the woman shouting at me?  She actually was talking right over me and raising her voice as I was talking to her-interrupting and steamrolling me, and I said, ""it's a yes or no question-will I get credit for the payment if I paid it today?""  She screamed ""YES!!!"" We actually were in a shouting match I could not believe it. I work with the public too, and even if someone is being irritating, you just don't go off on them. It was an HOUR before I was able to reach a supervisor. I said I would just take money from savings to pay it all and not in installments because I would not deal with this again. She said if I opt out of their bill pay service I will be blocked. Whatever. They accidentally doubled my bill to six hundred from three hundred eariler this year due to an error, then this today.  When I'm severely depressed is when I have the least patience and can tolerate the least.  I was weirded out about being ""blocked from their service,""and if ""I ever have medical debt I can't use their service-will just go to collection,""  but I don't like being screamed at.  God! Everything-and I mean everything-gets on my nerves. 
I need some serious help. ",depression
Relationship with yourself,"in psychology world they suggest your relationship with yourself determines your relationship with others!? 
Yes! I agree. Totally agree.
the self.. such an interestng word. It’s much bigger and more powerful than we ever comprehend.. 
the philosipher Rumi said; you are not a drop in the ocean, you are the ocean in a drop. It is one of my fabourite quotes. 
When you love and respect yourself and your needs, you love everyone too. And will feel loved by everyone, because they will like what they see, and will want to get closer. There are exceptions, feelings like differences, jealousy, unhealthy competitiveness can play a part in changing this rule one way or another, but I’m speaking in general terms and most likely result from a healthy level self love. 
Im not good at it, my self love range from zero, to about 60%.. but my maximum figure was only 40% not long ago. So they more I take care of myself, the more I see results from my efforts, and how others around me too react to it, the more confidence I grow and I become gradually become a believer, that I am actually a worth person, I deserve good things.. 
and all that in fact helps my mental state, building confidence is a un process, to realize I have potential of achieving a lot, and if I haven’t achieved it yet, is only because I didn’t try enough before. So we just keep going and trying.. one day at a time, one step at a time..",depression
Not doing ok,With the pandemic going on and an over paranoid husband staying home when his boss said he could work; means I am not ok. He is a narcissistic sociopath that is also verbally abusive. He refuses to acknowledge this. The longer we are forced to stay in the same house with no breaks from each other the more I wanna just end it all so I don't have to be around to hear how worthless I am or that everything I own is trash.. I am still in physical pain that Drs are not going to help me with other than saying come see me again and try that again.. Take more drugs! Which makes me wanna overdose just to prove the point that taking the max dose of an nsaid does not fix what is torn. In fact it does not even help the pain the tear causes. I started drinking at 10 this morning. And have been holding back tears for the better part of the day. But no one in real life is bothering to check in to see if I am ok. So would anyone really miss me if I were gone?,depression
What are you doing under your mask?,"This season of isolation is hard on all of us. However, my life has not changed much, because I live alone and am always by myself. So, what the world is experienceing is my typical day of social distancing in my home due to many reasons. But the thing that is different for me is wearing these masks. I have been depressed and I've been going through a lot of grief due to the loss of my therapist, but the other day I made myself crack up in public. I thought to myself. ""you know nobody can see if I'm smiling or making faces under this mask."" Well, that's what I started doing. I had a lot of fun making faces under the mask in public. It may sound stupid to some of you, but it was such a stress reliever to me and quite humorous. I'm just trying to lighten the load! Anyway, I hope everyone is hanging in there!!",depression

Feeling depressed.,"Hello Everyone,I am writing this down in the depression group because due to certain changes that I decided to do in my life today, I am feeling a little bit depressed. I don't know what depression feels like, But I don't feel any motivation to do anything, not even doing fun activities like listening to music or watching a nice movie, nothing interests me anymore. The changed that I did in my life which I talked about before is that I decided to stop watching porn videos completely. Ever since that, I realized that my whole life and my sexual energy has been contaminated with this addiction. But even after knowing how bad this addiction is, stopping the same is not making me happy, instead its making me feel lost and out of zeal.

I am welcoming any comments, please tell me that it will get better and its just a phase and it will pass and when I am out of it, I will be even more stronger and happier.",depression

ive been diagnosed with depression/anxiety but my dr. Feels that underlying depression has triggered anxiety symptoms.

Things got to me today,"It was a bit ironic as my best friend told me the other day that she was impressed with how well I've been doing though this isolation. I am a very social person so not being able to go out and visit is tough for me. I've been doing well with messages and phone calls but it's just not the same. The big thing for me though is not having a set routine. That always seems to get me down for whatever reason. I am working from home but it's not the same at all. Tonight I was talking to my friend on the phone  and the tears were streaming down my face. I hate that I just start crying out of the blue. We were taking about her horse, nothing emotional at all. I hit a low in November and it took a couple of months to get back to myself, I am not going back there. I fucking hate it there.

Please help,"How do you help a partner with depression. Im pretty sure my boyfriend is depressed but gives me mixed messages on how to help him.  He tells me he wants to be alone then asks favors of me.  Then he wants to be alone but doesn't want me to leave his house.  Then wants me to leave to be alone.  Its a crazy cylce of him seeming to not know what he wants and putting me in the middle of it.  His drinking and weed consumption has increased a lot as well.  He is very unhappy in his life, mostly his living situation but seems to lack life skills to get him out of his situation.  He can't seem to save money since most of it is spent of beer and weed.  Then gets mad he can't move out because of lack of money.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I am very supportive and always there if he needs me but Ive been feeling really neglected lately.  My needs aren't being met in this relationship but I am having a hard time letting go.  I do have some codependancy issues.  His issues to me seem so small.  His rent is small and he has money left over to save.  But for some reason he can't.  He also seems to blame others for his unhappiness.  Says everyone stresses him out.  He has even said he wants to move to another state away from everyone.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do?  I really do love him but I am wearing down.  I just want him to be happy and find some peace but I am doubting if he has the ability to be happy.  Is there anything I can do to help?",depression

Alone,"Im sorry if this doesnt make much sense a lot of this has been bottled up for a long time now 
I grew up in an unstable household for the first ten years of my life until my mom commit suicide. My parents would drink and argue every night and we had a terrible bedbug infestation. The only way of escape for me was my grandmas house, which me and my dad moved into soon after my moms death. We had a large family but soon most of them left or died out too. At a certain point it was just my grandma, dad, and I living in the house. Things were hard but I was thriving academically, even had dreams of getting into Yale freshman year. Once the summer of sophomore year hit though my dad started drinking off the rocks and losing his mind. He wasnt the same and I started watching myself fall behind. I had to leave therapy because he lost his job and we lost healthcare and then a year later he left us for a girl then died a few weeks later. Its been a year since then (im 16) and although I wasnt doing the best before Ive watched myself spiral out of control. My friends knew he died and watched me struggle and distance myself but didnt say anything or try to support me and I would feel like a bother reaching out to them. At the same time not a single one of them offered me a hand when I was struggling they just watched me go and accepted it. I just feel so alone now and Im in an unhealthy relationship with a boy who doesnt seem to care but Im afraid of losing someone else and Im afraid of being alone so I dont want to leave. To make things better my alcoholic cousin who steals, lies, and freeloads moved in soon after because my dad was the one that kicked him out but he isnt here anymore. Now my grandma and cousin argue all the time and day to day life is a struggle to get through. I have assignments piling up and Ill be beyong lucky if I get into a decent college and it just seems unfair the way life pans out. All of this isnt even the tip of the iceberg either and everything is too much especially being alone in quarantine. I feel overwhelmed and like too much is going wrong at once idk.

New to this group,"I'm not sure what I am looking for here, but I guess some idea that I am not alone in this and maybe some treatment ideas. I have had generalized anxiety disorder for about 12 years, was on citalopram with no big issues and seemed pretty good. Occasionally some bumps in the road but nothing too big. I got sick in November, and nothing has been normal since. My anxiety was at peak level, but has calmed since January with the help of Effexor 150mg and therapy. However, I feel like what I have started experiencing would be more depression than anxiety. I was struggling about every 4 weeks for a few days, but I successfully distracted myself and could get past it. Now that I am stuck at home, I feel consumed. For the first 2 weeks of staying home I was fine, doing projects, etc. For the last 5 days that has been quite different. I sleep fairly well, and sleep at least 8 hours, but more like 9 or 10. As soon as I wake up, I feel a dread for the day ahead. I push myself through the motions of getting ready for the day, put it is hard. After that, I feel exhausted and just want to lay on the couch. No appetite, though I make myself eat something with my pills. There are moments of feeling normal, but they are fleeting, and usually only in the afternoon/evening. Most days I go outside for around an hour because listening to the birds makes me feel a little better. I cry on and off at anything or nothing at all, and I am not a typical crier. While the recent situation has made the symptoms harder to ignore, they are not new. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist, therapist, and regular doctor over the next two days (all telehealth). I'm very unsure where to go from here. Thanks for listening.",depression
Hanging on by a thread,"Trigger warning.......please read with caution. I dont want to cause anyone any harm I just need somewhere to vent...

I feel like I just need to vent. I know most of this probably seems jumbled and doesn't make any sense.I am barely hanging on by a thread. I am beyond stressed, my depression is really bad right now. My anxiety is through the roof. I am an essential employee. I am on the front lines daily. I work in a hospital on the EVS/housekeeping crew. We have a covid unit on one of our floors. I work on that floor several times a week cleaning. I am under all my gear when on the floor in the red zones. The stress is getting to me. Let me say that I live with my mother and brother. My mother is immune compromised. She was told by her doctor if she catches this covid she is dead. She will not make it. I keep having nightmares at night seeing her on a metal slab being dragged out of the hospital to the refrigerated truck we have parked out back. I am barely sleeping. I am so scared I am going to bring this home and be the one to kill her. I have no where else to stay in the meantime so i have to go home. I have had patients reach out to hold my hand while cleaning their room. I have heard codes called on the covid floor while at work. My anxiety is through the roof. I keep having breakdowns at work and home. Ending up in the bathroom at work crying my eyes out shaking. My stomach is a mess. My whole body hurts from the shakes when I breakdown. I feel like my world is crashing around me. I feel like I cant breath. I feel doom. I have turned to drinking while at home to cope, to quiet my mind. Nothing crazy but I am drinking a couple drinks a night. I talked with my counselor last week on the phone during our phone appointment. She said she was going to email the person who prescribes my depression meds to see if there is anything she can do. I have not heard back. I am breaking, I am a mess. I cant eat anything foor wise without getting sick. My mind is starting to get dark again. In the past I was in an outpatient hospitalization program for 2 weeks. I am scared I am going to end back up to that point. I have made such leaps and bounds since that point a year or so ago. I feel myself sliding back down. ",depression

I want to talk to my friends but even with the phone in my hand, I don't? I just don't text them, call them, view their messages... I've been making lists on Pinterest and stuff about things I ""have time to do now"" but they're just lists. I feel like I'm suffocating yet I am like smiling at the same time because I should be happy that I am home with my family? But I'm not? It's super tiring. I want to text my friends but it has been days... I haven't responded to them and I feel like I should... but I don't know what to say? Like, ""Hey, sorry I haven't responded in over a week and a half. Just been chilling with my chaotic self for a bit?"" I'm dramatic I know. Sorry, y'all I need to get this off my chest. I'm at the point where I might just drop everything and drive back to the dormitory and be there alone for a while and see how I get by day-by-day. ",depression

Reaching Out,"Right now I am quite alone, no one to talk to.  Lost my family long ago.  Things are really bad with me, I don't get out of bed, this has been going on for since this pandemic started.  Have had problems all of my life, but getting Lyme Disease multiple times made things much, much worse.  I don't know what happened to my only two close friends.  One does not respond, some one I have known for over 20 years. The other just texts.  My biggest concern is that I will become homeless because of all of this.  Company I work for was very slow before this started.  Am 60 years old and not good health.  Anyways I am just reaching out for some human contact to try and get me going again.  Thanks for reading this and God bless you all.",depression
I am a furious depressed kitty kat ,"For over a year my ex best mate of 20 years ignored me, my boyfriend at the time heard me breaking my heart about it, turns out they were both smoking hard drugs and having a good laugh about my mental and physical health together.

"Really tough, still feel off/weird","In the middle of this whole pandemic I got sick. I don't know with what, but it really scared me. I was sleeping and recovering last week, but I still feel really weird. My sore throat is gone and the low fever, but I feel really strange. For some odd reason my skin hurts. Usually when I get a fever or sick, this can happen.  Even just wearing clothes hurts my skin. My scalp hurts too when I comb my hair.  When I turn my head from side to side, I get a bad headache.  I can't seem to ever get enough sleep, and feel this terrible malaise. I have some back issues, and since we can't go anywhere and I'm sitting all day working from home, my back pain is a lot more intense. Of course, I can't go get a massage like I usually do. This usually works.  I feel so strange, dizzy and lethargic.
Last night I logged into my support group zoom meeting. The coach is really helpful. There is this one lady there, who used to try to hang out with me in the past. She got me to take her camping a couple of summers ago. What a mistake and a disaster. Everyone was struggling this week with job loss and the other collateral problems that go with the current situation.  People were feeling low and depressed. What does this lady do? She starts chirping on about how wonderfully happy she is, which is fine if she is, but starts pointing at us through the screen, and saying, ""y'all are so depressed and you're dragging me down, you could be better if you did what I do.""  It really pissed me off. I thought she was  a total b****.  I remember when she used to go to the in person groups. She was the MOST depressed person there for sure, cried constantly and about everything. I really did not need in the middle of this to go there and have her tell me off. When it was my turn to talk she got up and walked off from the screen.  The coach said to her, ""who died and made you God?""  I thought that was funny.  I just can't understand how or why in the middle of this disaster that's upending everyone's lives, how she could go off on us.  The man I was dating actually got the virus and it really upset me, in addition to our breakup. I was worried to death and scared for him.
This has really got me slipping into a clinical depression. I just stare off during the workday, I feel useless and lifeless. Just not knowing what is going to happen, how or when, people around me getting sick, having to put on a mask and gloves just to get groceries, it's like walking uphill every minute of every day. And I still feel like I'm fighting something off and can't stop sleeping. It's like my main activity.",depression
Going through a tough time,Right now I am going through a very hard time. I had to quit my job due to anxiety and depression. I've had ECT many times and I'm still feeling depressed. I feel I have no reason to live. My divorce destroyed me. It's been 4 years. My doctor is great and has increased my medicine. I'm hoping that it helps me. I lie in bed everyday all day. I just pick at things in the refrigerator and make no meals. I don't take showers for days because it's so hard. I can't get myself into a routine. I find no reason to leave bed. Please if anyone has any suggestions or a nice comment to give I would appreciate that. Even paying the bills is such a hard thing to do. I just need some hope. A reason to go on. ,depression

Hey,"I used to be here years ago, thought I was better. I have crohns, ptsd, anxiety/ocd, depressive mood disorder, fibromyalgia, arthritis, asthma, eczema, so never sure what group to be in. I had what I thought was a good stretch. Turns out I was a little manic. Bounced from job to job, to stay at home mom, to job to job until I started unraveling. I started working to over spend on credit cards, until it drove a wedge between my husband and me. He pulled away emotionally feeling taken advantage of, until he told me he wasn't in love with me anymore, at which point I completely mentally broke. I got so bad I was put in outpatient group therapy for 3 months, while seeing a psychiatrist and experimenting with meds to figure out how to treat all my mental disorders. I was functional but still in one on one therapy for months feeling erratic until I started seeing my current psychiatrist and we figured out the right tx. Now it's trying to fix the marriage, started a new career. The marriage is better but the intimacy is missing which effects my moods and brings on loneliness and sadness, and my mom died in February. So now I only have my journal to talk to.",depression
2019 Taxes,All right all you worry warts and so and so's.  After three months of procrastinating and worrying I did my taxes and I was pleased at the outcome.  It took a big load off my mind.  One less thing to worry about.  Just wanted to share that with my DS friends.,depression
Broken,I feel completely broken today.  I want to stop.  I need to stop.  People are so cruel to animals.  You know how this virus started.   From a live animal market in China which means they have all kinds of animals there in cages and kill them on the spot and butcher them in front of the other animals too.  Fucking serves us right.  Pay back's a bitch.  Humans are so stupid though they'll never change their ways.  This is our chance to wake the fuck up.  Stop killing and torturing innocent animals.  Stop buying animal products.  Get involved in animal rights.  Wake up and see what's happening.  I don't belong here anymore.  I'm just done.  ,depression
Can't sleep,My husband told me I lacked empathy because I got upset he kept falling asleep during the time he was supposed to be staying up with the baby so I could get some sleep.

It was so bad I had to peddle hair to take care of myself. Like my whole life is fucking miserable. Sometimes I beg God to just let me die. Like why be here and you can't have a week month years of happiness. I truly been trying to work on myself. The therapist I seen. Oh I stopped cuz she wanted me to stay wit his sorry ass.

Bad Dream,"I keep having a reocurring dream that goes something like this:

I am walking towards people and as I do fog rolls in. I try to talk to them and they turn away, I try to reach for them and my hands go right through them.
I try to talk to them and my voice does not resound around them.
I scream and nothing hears me but a voice in the distance answers.
I ask the voice ""Why do they ignore me why can't i reach them"" to which the voice replies ""You are not worthy"".
I say ""They are my friends and family and those women i try to love what can i do to reach them"" and the voice answers back""You are not worthy and will never be worthy"" and my friends fade out and the fog remains but a bitter cold surrounds me and freezes my blood and my tears turn to ice.
The dream gets darker from there....

I know where this comes from in a way i feel that i am nothing most of the time. I try to make friends but only a few will bother with me and I try to find someone to love but i am never enough and always delegated to the ""friend zone"". I feel so lonely and lost and wish there was someone out there that can say one day ""I love you rian"" but i fear god hates me too much to allow me the blis of being in someone's arms.

Depressed about coronavirus and everything,"When this first hit, the coronavirus, i was managing ok.  Now, not as well.  The stress is really building up.  I've got other major stressors going on too.  I'm having trouble going to work or concentrating on anything.  I am very depressed and anxious.  I don't want to lose my job.  I don't want to die that way, it seems so awful.  I'm not really a people person but i feel really bad for those who have caught it and died or lost loved ones. 
I am also stressed by the delay and disorganization of the response.  I think social distancing should have started soon and mandatory masks in public should start right now unless someone has breathing problems or is a baby or something.  I'm also dealing with a work environment that isn't complying with social distancing and other safety recommendation.  I've already talked to union, management, health district as so far very little is changing.  i'm just overwhelmed with frustration and confusion. 
I called the CDC today and the guy i talked to said that 50% of people calling in were essential workers who were being forced to work in unsafe conditions.  He didn't have a good answer for me about what to do and no one has.  Where do we turn for help?  I'm tired of being this expendable peon that needs to keep working and I need to sacrifice myself so society doesn't crumble.

Dad's diagnosis... not good,"Hi all,

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on March 11th. He started chemo March 19th. They are giving him 3-11 months to live.  I am so sad.  We are very close. We both have been dealing with depression also for years.  Mine is pretty well managed,  my dad's is not.  He's been very depressed for 3 years now, he's tried to fight it but hasn't been very successful,  and now this only makes things worse. 
I'm also scared because I'm an ICU nurse and not only do I know about this type of cancer, but I'm also scared due to this COVID-19 pandemic.  I don't want to spread anything to him, but I also want to spend time with him.  My manager and my dad's oncologist are working on making me exempt from taking care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.  Until then I have asked the charge nurses to please not assign me to those patients.  Most are very nice and good about it,  but one charge nurse was not nice. He assigned me to a patient who came up from the ER with suspected COVID-19 when 4 other nurses could've admitted this patient.  I don't care about me,  but I may only have 3 months left with my dad,  and that charge nurse was very rude to me when I requested what I did.  I realize I'm not special,  but my I am caring for my dad right now. 
That being said,  I also put in the paperwork for FMLA to help my dad with things. Family is so much more important to me then my job.
I'm sad,  angry, and in denial about this all at the same time. My dad is 71, before this cancer diagnosis he was walking 3 miles a day,  shoveling snow,  and was very healthy physically,  mentally is another story. But, I thought I had AT LEAST 10 more years with him.  Now it's less than 1 year.  I don't know what I'll do without him.  He's more like me than any other person on the planet.  We are so alike it's ridiculous",depression

Glad they are not alarmed, because it scares me. The only thing I've gone out for is groceries and physical therapy, and I put fuel in the car.  I went to a friend's house and hung out one-on-one, but he never goes anywhere; he works from home.

Medication Question Atomoxetine &Retalin,"Good Evening, 
I started taking Ritalin in the morning then three hours later I take 60MG Atomoxetin (Strata). On my first day of taking both cocktails of medication, I feel very mellow. I was wondering has anyone every took both these cocktails. The reason I ask is I read about the side effects of Atomoxetine (Strata) and I am mostly concerned with heart problems--chest pain, trouble breathing, feeling like you might pass out; signs of psychosis--hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), new behavior problems, aggression, hostility, paranoia. From your experience taking these medications have you experienced these side affects. ",depression
I got sick,"I don't know what I got sick with, but I did get sick.  My dr. does not seem to think that it's serious, but anything scares me at this time. She is giving me antibiotics and vitamin C. For the past few weeks I've known that I have been fighting something, just so exhausted that I could hardly keep going. I had a cough and felt bad on Sunday, slept all the way through Monday, and woke up Tuesday with a horrible sore throat that closed up the back of my mouth. To make matters worse, I was still obsessing on the breakup and looking at his social media, and what does he say except that he had contracted the virus and how bad it was. I felt horrible, but there really is nothing I can do. As much as I want to help him, I have to remind myself that this is a person who just was not that hyped about being with me and was willing to let me go.
I feel better today, just a little scratchy and sore, but I certainly will not be posting any more on social media. I mentioned that I was not feeling well in one group, and a couple people starting going off on me and attacking me. I haven't left the house hardly at all, esp since I got sick and they were telling me not even to get groceries. But they don't know what is wrong with me, neither does my dr.  I don't know. This sucks.  I am feeling considerable better today and working through it. There really is not much that can be done. ",depression
Facing it all-trigger,"I will say that none of this has been easy.  I can only handle so much of this and so much of the news.  I feel traumatized by the news stories of field hospitals, of things going on both in the US, and in Spain and Italy.  It's chilling.  I am either addicted to listening to the news or can't stand it.  It's like a horror movie or nightmare. I'm often reminded of Edgar Allan Poe and some of his stories.
Anyway...work is a stressor. Now that we are ""working from home,"" I'm facing some interesting dynamics. At first, there was sheer panic and isolation and depression, as the recent isolation from my breakup was setting in. Then, there is the struggle of getting basic supplies, of stores and shelves being absolutely empty. There is the challenge of driving from store to store, and getting up very early to do so, otherwise everything will be gone. There is the inability to visit the library or bookstore, the isolation... and then suddenly...like some kind of runner's high, this strange calm sets in.  I fell asleep for the first time on my own lastnight-no pills, no panic, just sleeping. I had some revelatory dreams and feel more ""in touch with myself,"" as they say. I suddenly feel this strange sense of clarity about myself and my situation.
I have a LOT of anxiety about work. I was having stomach aches and cramps all the time. And then I realized what was happening-every time we have a virtual meeting for work or there is any interaction with work, this vague abdominal pain creeps in.  But now that I am not commuting and facing a toxic environment constantly, there are a couple of interesting phases: first: withdrawl, then adaptation.
It appears to me that there is nothing right I can do for my boss or my students. I've long known I'm phasing out of this career. I do take joy in my online classes that are propelling me toward another career.  But, I notice an interesting corellation between my relationship with my family/parents (abusive) and my work. if it's true that we gravitate subconsiciously toward that which is familiar and replay out old patterns-then I certainly have done that with my career. If I am ""unconscious"" or playing out everything subconsciously, then I'm doing it for sure. I work in a career where I am never physically or emotionally safe.  I'm always waiting for the next snide attitude or remark, of the next time I am wrong, for the next dismal review. And nothing ever, ever, ever seems to make it better, none of my efforts, for anyone. I never seem to do a good job no matter how hard I try and no one ever seems to be happy. Our trainer talks to me like a two year old.  This reminds me very much of my abusive situation and my previous domestic violence. I'm suddenly aware of the pattern.
And the degrading doesn't really stop emotionally. So far, I had the crap kicked out of me once on a prior job during a fight that wasn't controlled. This venue is not much different-one student brought a loaded gun to my class; my photo is taken without my permission and smeared all over social media. One student tried to grope me, my computer equipment was vandalized. One teacher at our site got punched and they really didn't do anything.
I think I really had a defining moment, as during this quarantine I still allowed to go to physical therapy.  This week, I was on the bicycle and started chatting with a woman who was in really bad shape-an elderly woman. I asked her what brought her to physical therapy. She told me the horror story as I was looking at the scars and how debilitated she was: she worked at a nearby high school, but was out for PT for six months. Why? During a fight, she was pushed down the stairs and her leg was broken in three places. She is disabled now. The kids were out for two days only for the incident. I wondered why criminal charges were not pressed. Much like our school, nothing was done and no attention was paid to her. This was a real wake up call for me.
On the flipside, the medical student who is assisting with my PT is also a former high school teacher. His story is interesting and we talked at length. He invested in Bitcoin, bought low, sold high.  He admitted after several conversations that he made-get this-a million dollars via smart investing. He was formerly a high school biology teacher. He quit work and is retraining to be a physical therapist-because this is what he wants to do. He withdraws 40,000/year for living expenses, pays for school, and bought his mom a house.  A million is LOT of money, but even that may not enable you to never work again for the rest of your days if you have many years to go. He will work because he wants to. Amazing. I learned a lot from both stories and am currently reprioritizing.  If you believe that you are meant to meet the people you do and and that the universe is talking to you, I might have something to learn from both these people. I certainly have the quiet time to reflect. The balance in society and its institutions has been sorely amiss and very dysfunctional. This crisis may pose as a strange opportunity provided we don't get ill!  I am reminded of the old story about God sending you a ""boat, plane, and train."" I can see the metaphor in this. ",depression
what's stopping me?,"honestly, i've no idea what i'm doing. i've resorted to online chats, trying to get as much advice as i can. my life is utter mess, and i'm not joking when i say i have no one to talk to. no one real, no one genuine. my dad died around 3 years ago, part of me resents  my mother because he died and she didn't, but i do love her. of course i love her, but i was closer to him. and part of me hates my sister because she still has 'her' parent, the one she is closer to and mine is gone. they have their inside jokes and laughs and i feel like an outsider in my own home. 
i have nothing left, what am i fighting for? what am i living for? a future that i don't want? a lifetime of just barely holding on? 
the only thing stopping me from, you know. is my family, i couldn't bear to put them through another death after my dad. especially me. 
so, this is what i'm trying. anyone got any wise words to shoot at me? i'm not sure how this works but i'm kind of looking also for someone to talk to 1-1, to support eachother and just have eachother there. let me know.

Feel Like it’s My Fault,"I ponder on whether it’s my fault I have lupus. Maybe it’s because too much anxiety built up in me. Maybe it’s because I was dehydrated. Maybe it’s because I was terribly fatigued from overexercising and eating little to nothing everyday. And now that I have this condition, I’m just like “well, you got yourself into this mess...it’s well-deserved.”",depression
"Hello, first timer.","I have no friends and no family really to talk to so I hope this support group can help and make me feel like the whole world doesn't hate me. 
I hope I can get some feedback and help make sense of my emotions. To start I'm going to give a little background:
I'm the youngest child of 4. My siblings and I came from different dads. Growing up, my biological father had left. My 3 siblings still had a relationship with their dads, whether it was phone calls or actual visits. It made me feel rejected.  I didn't completely miss out because our step dad was incredible, I wouldn't trade him for the world. Yet, I still find that feeling of rejection haunting me. 
Being the youngest wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. My mom had her issues. To start, she was in a violent relationship. She would disappear days to weeks at a times. Longer periods were when she was too bruised and embarrassed to come home. I remember one time, begging her not to go and crying in her lap until I fell asleep. When I had woke, my mom was gone. I felt rejected again. I thought how or why would she choose a man like that over her own kids?!
She finally got out of the relationship, but suffered from a drinking problem. Around this time, I was in high school and my brothers had all left and joined the military. I envied my brothers more because they had their dads, they had their childhood, their teen years, to me everything. During this time, I turned into the parent. I had to pick up my mom from bars, sometimes had to go in there to drag her out. Whenever she was stirring up trouble, sometimes dead of night, I'd get a call and had to go get her. On holidays, I would end up going to my uncles house just so I wouldn't be alone because mom was out drinking and my dad usually worked. I remember one time, my aunt was dropping me off and my moms leg was hanging out of her car, door wide open, I was worried she was dead or something but no she was just passed out drunk. Times like that I wished my aunt was my mom. Now years have passed and I've seen my real mom, not the one who was lost and hurting, and I admire her strength and big heart she has. 
Two years ago, before my grandma had passed away, she had requested to come live with us and have my mom (her child she had wished was dead, so least favorite you could say), take care of her. My mom immediately, took leave from work and took my grandma in, we had turned our living room into my grandmas hospital room. Everyday we'd all work together to give her her meds, treat her wounds, give her showers, serve her meals, everything till my grandmas very last breath. 
The night of my grandmas death, my family had split. Our house is small, hence grandma being in the living room. But my uncle, aunt and cousins were all at my uncles house celebrating his birthday when they got the bad news they immediately came over along with my grandmas siblings. We were all rotating in in out, saying our goodbyes. Inside the room when it all had went down was my mom, my cousin, my grandmas siblings and I. My mom had politely asked us to step out so the siblings can have their time alone to say one last goodbye. During that time my cousin had flipped and started cursing my mom out and then here comes my aunt then before you know it my uncle was calling my brothers out to the street, mom and aunt were fighting and then the cops had arrived. That day I not only lost my grandma, but I lost my uncle, my aunt, and my cousins who were basically sisters to me since the day we were born. So again, felt alone after that but also angry at them for leaving my life. I constantly find myself missing them, especially with having no friends, I'm lonely. 
I find myself pushing away anyone else that tries to get close to me but I don't want it to be that way. My boyfriend and I have been fighting a lot lately. After these fights, I do realize that it's my fault. I feel like some of his actions trigger these past experiences where I'm not chosen, rejected. I feel like my heart has many holes, people leave all the time, but now my actions and instincts are pushing him away. I don't mean to, it just happens. 
Are their any tips on how I can move forward, how I can fix myself so I can have a healthy happy life. I appreciate any feedback even constructive criticism 

thank you",depression
Nobody loves me,"I'm feeling really depressed today. It started this morning when a staff member at my personal care home was all excited because she got a new car. And it reminded me that I'll probably never have a car of my own again even though I have a valid driver's license. And that means I'll never feel independent again in this lifetime. I have no people in my life since my husband died to love me or care about me. No siblings, no children, nobody. I'm very isolated where I live with 17 other people who are acquaintances, not friends. I long for people to talk to that I share something in common with, and there's nobody here. Before my husband died he signed his car and his $38,000 pension check over to a woman who he barely knew rather than to me. That tells me that even he didn't love me towards last. The last words I remember him saying to me were ""There is no us."" I feel very sad when I think about that. At one time I had my parents and aunts and uncles, but they are all dead now. I'm 64 years old now. I estimate I'll live another 20 years without anyone to feel close to. I wish I could move back to my home town where I have a chance of finding some extended family. I have none in the town I'm living in now, which is 200 miles away from my home town. I'm living on Social Security--I can't afford to move. I have no life. I just spend my days reading books. I can't even eat normal food since I had all my upper teeth extracted. I wish I'd never done that--I wasn't having any pain or problems with them. I live on potato salad and Ben & Jerry's ice cream because I can't chew normal food. Somebody takes me to the grocery store every week and their supply of Ben & Jerry's is mighty low with the current crisis. I wish I could see a way that things would get better--that I'd have some people in my life but I just don't see how it's going to happen.",depression
idk,"i never told anyone this irl before, except a therapist.. but only for a few minutes.  but i was talking to one of my online friends tonight and i opened up to him about my childhood abuse from my dad. its so hard for me to talk about it irl because it feels like im incapable of talking about my feelings.  i wasnt really raised like that, i didnt really get lots of affection and i dont feel connected with my parents.  both my mom and dad would verbally and physically abuse me.. but with my dad it was way worse because of his anger issues and violent behavior. it just hurt more with him ig. i dont really want to get into specific fights but i think it was bad.. he only made me bleed one time tho and i grew up being scared of him and hiding from him whenever he would get mad.  i think the verbal abuse was worse because he would say the worst things to me and i would feel so awful about myself and i felt so worthless.
i think the abuse is affecting my relationships irl.. like with my bf i find it impossible to be physical with him.. like cuddling and stuff.  i still flinch whenever he touches my back or touches my neck.. it took until our third date for me to hug him.. for the longest time i thought that was normal but it was tonight when i realized that its not. its also impossible for me to open up to people, i distance myself from people and im also incredibly shy too.  i hate showing emotion or affection cuz idk how to, i honestly dont think my parents ever hugged me unless they were apologizing for hurting me.. and whenever they did it felt wrong and uncomfortable. sometimes thats how i feel with my friends and they dont even know. i felt like i was keeping a secret from all my friends growing up and i never wanted them to come over my house because of him.. he was just so unpredictable.
the abuse isnt that bad rn.. whenever my dad would get mad when i was a kid, it would be over dumb stuff.. like spilling my drink or making too much noise. but the abuse rn is mainly just verbal.. i just wish i told someone what was happening when i was younger, like in middle school or elementary school. i kept it from everyone i ever knew for so long and idk why. i just wish someone knew, because it really hurt me inside and im just now realizing it.",depression
How do I talk to my parents about this?,"In 2015 I was diognosed with depression and it got worse over the years. In the beginning of 2019 I started to feel better so I decided to get taken off of my antidepressants, but now my depression is much worse and my parents aren't helping. I have had 0 motivation for anything except for color guard which is my escape. I am constantly yelled at by my parents and I am constantly reminded of how much of a bad daughter I am. I am failing classes and I am struggling to keep my room clean to the point where it's going to take an entire day to clean it. Well now that I'm stuck in Coronavirus lockdown, I'm at home for 3 more weeks. I'm already behind in my classes (I'm a sophmore in highschool) and my parents are just yelling at me to clean and it's not making my situation better. I'm crying so much it's unreal and I can't go anywhere. I haven't talked to my best friend in days even though I've been trying. I need to talk to my mom about this but she is always so mad at me and I can't do anything or say anything without her getting mad. Besides she wouldn't believe me. I tried to tell her I wanted to kill myself last year and she started to yell at me and say ""I just want attention"". She refuses to believe anything is wrong with me and that I'm just lazy. She gets mad that I have a back issue and I can't clean for long periods of time. She's never happy with me. She's always yelling and I know that is a reason why my depression is so bad but she never let's me talk to her about it. What should I do?",depression
ending it.,"today my ex asked me how i felt and i my response was i feel like blowing my brians out because how alone and depressed i been in the last month and all he told me to do was do it already... i dont know why i open up but i know i should just keep my mouth shut from now on, i feel so done already...",depression
The rabbit hole,"In this world I have never fit in and have never belonged. I have loved but it's always insufficient, i have believed but it has never been enough, i have given to others but .... I have tried to live a good life and be there for others that have needed a kind word or a shoulder to cry on but it has only left me alone and empty with no one who will listen to my true cries. Yes there are those that will be there for a while and only for certain things but there has never been anyone that has wanted to help quell my madness or my sorrow.
When i was a kid in a certain religion they refered to what i am as someone in a soul death. My soul has been bleeding out and crying out for others for so long but no one has trully answered it's cries not even me. I feel like i am drowning in the blood of a soul that has been hemoraging forever and what I desperately need to heal my soul is always out of reach always kept from me and i am afraid it is just because i am undeserving. No matter how much work i put in to others so they will hopefully hear my souls scream and help me tend to my wounds nothing works.
Sometimes i wish i could be unfeeling as the rest of the world where everyone just takes and doesn't give as much in return because they don't have to. I've never been enough to people even though i try with all my might and all my strength just to be sucked down that rabbit hole again.
Sometimes i wish i could go back to Clonazepam even though i don't need it at least then parts of my mind were numbed to the world and other things were easier to keep to myself like love and passion...without it my mind is screaming at me for how low i am in this world and how undeserving i truly have become. A piece of garbage to be discarded at the earliest sign of work for someone else to put into me.
I wish i could shift my feelings sometimes...then again i wish i could eliminate them all together....get rid of the Id and keep only the ego and superego so i stay in reality with logic and no emotion or primal drives.
i'm almost glad sometimes i have no access to others....then again it is like being sucked down a deep dark hole like Alice was into a chaotic world that will eat you up and spit you out without a thought. I hate when these depression spells come...hopefully it won't last too long.",depression
Just breakdowns....tired,After crying my eyes out for about an hour ...i still feel super down not only do i feel lonely which is ridiculous because i have my kids and my hub but i just feel alone...sad down alone angry cant shake these feelings and hurt inside i curl up and cry so bad my insomnias gotten worse i need air but dont/cant leave my home....i pray and still im hurting....yes i see a therapist but i still feel like this im so tired of being tired of feelin depressed sad and angry ....somedays i feel like i wana sleep for weeks on end im just tired of being me.......tired......,depression
The isolation situation is getting to me.,"I am agoraphobic by nature....I prefer to not go out. Which is a great skill to have in this situation.
But this is starting to overwhelm me.  Neither hubby nor I are sick, nor have we traveled. But we are trying to stay home out of respect and consideration. There is no where to go anyway most things are closed.                                                                                       
Due to hubby breaking his wrist we have been home since January. But I did have plans for us once the cast came off. I wanted to take a painting class, go to church on Sunday, I had just gotten us passes to the gym and the pool. So we could get back into shape. I was hoping to lose at least 10 lbs so I could get back into my work clothes. We were going to go to the dinner theatre. Actually it was our 20th anniversary a few days ago and we had planned on taking an actual vacation and maybe going on a cruise or spending a few days in Vegas. 
I just want to go to the movies. Or go clothes shopping. I want to see my daughter and granddaughter. They are staying away and staying as isolated as they can as well. 
Yes we have been using DVD's to do exercise routines and we have rented some movies online, and I do have some cute little painting kits from the dollar store that we can do. I am trying to make it fun and find a way to keep our spirits up......but each day I am sliding just a little bit lower. I even tried being ""happy"" about it. Saying this is awesome......no appts to try and fit in....no unneccesary money being spent... time to do my to do list.....no rushing......time to get caught up on my  PVR.....yay!                                                                                        But I am starting to feel like I just want to run, scream, escape.

Let's Talk,"Hi all I have health anxiety Ocdwith depression. I take busprione and my Dr just started me back on my Lexapro and kolonopin (to help me calm down until the lexapro kicks in). Of course this pandemic from hell has me as well as all of you on the biggest fear trip out of our lives.
My question is about depression everyone professional like my therapist and Dr. All say that anxiety and depression go hand and hand if you have one you most likely have the other. How is that so?

"Regret, recurrent Nightmare","This story starts years ago when I was in my twenties, I was a student nurse, when it came to the exams I was very ill with chronic fatigue syndrome, and failed the exams.  I am now having reaccuring nightmares about the exams, and  not qualifying, the thing is I have three cousins to which I was very close, I used to get asked what happened to my bright cousins, One is a Professor in a University, One an Opera Singer, and One was a Chemical Engineer, but now stays home.

Undecided on what course of action I should take..,"Hello, my name is Edin and I’m new to DailyStrength. So basically last month, just a few days before my 24th birthday, I sent a text to a friend telling her that I was contemplating suicide and didn’t feel like I wanted to live anymore and she called the cops and they took me to a clinic for a mental health assessment at 2 in the morning. They suggested I go see a psychiatrist and take medication to help me with my depression and anxiety (I may even have bipolar but I’m honestly not sure). Anyways at first I accepted that I need to go for my own good as well as those around me because I’ve been feeling very depressed for over 7 years now and while the suicidal thoughts come and go, they still linger back at some point even after they go away for a while.

But then while I was looking for a good psychiatrist, I started questioning whether I wanted to go down the route of taking medication at such a young age and potentially having to do so for the rest of my life to keep my depression and anxiety issues at bay and I started to wonder whether the issue could be solved naturally instead. I’ve had digestive issues, adrenal fatigue, vitamin deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances as well so I keep thinking if I can resolve these problems then maybe I can control my depression and anxiety better without the need for medication. But at the same time it’s hard to make the changes necessary to improve my life naturally because I feel so down every day and find it hard to get any sustained interest in daily activities and life so I don’t know how I can pull it off. Even something as simple as cleaning my room or taking care of my hygiene is a real chore to get me to do, that’s how low my interest in daily life is lately. I’m not against medication but I’m not entirely sure either whether or not it’s the right course of action to take or if I just need to push myself harder to make those natural changes happen and maybe results will come over time without the need for them.

Empty,"I can't stop thinking about her. I'm just gonna call her cherry. (that's not her real name)
I had a dream about cherry. It was wonderful. she drove me around in her car, and we lived together. I can't stop thinking of her and it hurts. before this dream, I wasn't thinking of her that much. She would come up in my mind every so often but now because of that dream, I can't shake her image out of my mind. I feel depressed. I feel empty. I miss her. I miss all the good times. I miss when things weren't so complicated. I'm not lesbian. This love I have for her is different. I'm not sure how to describe it. but it is similar in the way that I have butterflies in my stomach when I think of her. I love the way she laughs and how she always makes me smile when she makes a silly face. 
Cherry was my painting teacher/boss. it was an afterschool class program but I got paid so kinda like a job. I knew cherry all 4 years of high school, she even came to my graduation. 
I have this very large pit in my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up. I text cherry today and said hi but she never text back. I wish I could stay with her and never leave her sight. but I know people have lives. cherry has a life. but I wish there was away. I remember my therapist telling me I have relationship problems and its hard for me to say goodbye to someone. I don't want to seem clingy but cherry makes me so happy. I haven't seen cherry since my graduation. 
I feel very empty. my life was better when cherry was in it. not just cherry but all my painting friends too. we were all like a family and now that's all over. I feel completely horrible. I hate how much I love people and think about people. I might be loving someone that doesn't think about me anymore or who doesn't even miss me. Why does my heart have to be so big? Why do I care so much? I'm just hurting myself. I don't think cherry even miss me. 
it physically hurts so much. It feels like my heart just broke in half. I feel light-headed and sick with butterflies in my stomach. my body feels cold and hot. I what to laugh and cry. what type of love is this? I might just be a crazy person. 
I just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I wish I could just be erased from this world.",depression

Checking In,"I just wanted to see how everyone is doing, I know COVID-19 has upended everything and that we are living in a time of massive uncertainty, with far more questions than answers. I'm doing pretty well-- I'm very fortunate that pharmacies are still open, although where I'm working (in a central mail-order pharmacy) we are absolutely slammed with work. It's exhausting, but it's job security at least, and for that I am very grateful. When I'm not working, I'm home in my condo drawing, watching horror movies, and listening to music. I've also taken this opportunity to connect with family and friends with whom I'm not regularly in contact (as well as the ones I always text and call). I was psyched yesterday to find the Holy Grail that is toilet paper in a supermarket-- it was the highlight of my day haha. Hopefully everyone is staying safe and handling this pandemic the best they can.

I wish sometimes people that i know would just tell me flat out instead of trying to save my feelings because this way i can fix my attitudes etc.

ok my brain just shut down.

Stay Safe everyone and STAY HOME as much as possible. luckily here i am on a farm and i can go for long walks in the woods but we are not all so lucky.

not good,i just got news today that completely destroyed me and now idk what to do.  i got a letter from the college im going to next year and it was the tuition cost for next year.. and its so much more than i thought it'll be and i cant afford it and idk what to do anymore because i thought it'll be easy once i got accepted to the school but now its so much harder for me. i probably cant go anymore because theres no way i can afford going there for 4 years so i might as well drop out now to save myself 25k a year.. also cuz of the virus i cant even work at my job to get money and its been so hard staying at home by myself alone with my thoughts with no one to talk to because i dont have friends and its making me feel so shitty,depression

Depressed,I recently found out I have life threatening scirosses,depression
current crisis affecting me,"How many others are really affected by the current crisis? I am glad not to be at work because it's very toxic, but I do feel actually quite a bit *more* depressed than normal.  I could hardly sleep lastnight, and I woke up before the alarm.  I went to a dr. appt. today then took a long walk in nature, becuase rumination is deadly for me, and being quarantined at home encourages this.  In my area, we can't work in a Starbucks or library, which is probably true for everywhere/everyone.
Also, I am estranged from my family due to domestic violence and this estrangement is all the more obvious by the lack of communication during this time.  (It was the same during 9/11) But, that is a dysfunctional family for you.  The support groups I go to are via phone and online, but there is literally nowhere to go that anyone is allowed. It's either dr. office, post office, or grocery store/dollar store. I realize it's not only me and we are all going through this.  I just get very few, if any, phone calls. My best friend checks in on me and calls me occasionally, but it's depressing to be this forgotten, and I just broke up with my b/f too. So, it's worse than normal.  I'd call people but frankly I've nothing to talk about.  I mean what? Discuss the obvious?
There are so many unanswered questions as to the future. My plan to apply for different jobs and go to meetups for networking is blown.  You'd think I'd use the time to do the things I want to do, but no, I just feel awful and sit here. I just don't have the energy. Everything seems completely pointless.  Maybe I should read Man's Search for Meaning again.  It's an excellent book.  The store is out of bread, so I bake my own, which takes all day.  I'm so exhausted just driving around for *the* store that has laundry detergent, etc.  I came home from out of town to zero food in my house-or in the store. We left town just before this all exploded. Looking for a loaf of bread is truly demoralizing, especially when you are really, really hungry. I got the LAST pack of wheat on the shelf.  After waiting for the bread to rise, I went to put in in, and the stove was not working!!! But it came on again. At least I am schooled in some survival, am an excellent cook, and have a fair amount of practical skills overall, can pictch a tent, am a pretty good shot, used to go to the range.
The only thing that works for me are the nature walks, which I keep doing.  I had a nightmare that I was being waterboarded, so I think the news is really getting to me and fear of not being able to breathe.  I know how this is because I'm asthmatic, so for it to be worse by catching a virus like this, I just can't imagine.  I just broke down and cried buckets today. I'm afraid of catching this, I have asthma and would not fare well, possibly, if I did.  This is really scaring me.  It's just the feeling of pointlessness, esp. when they said it was going to go to the Southern Hemisphere and then come back around again. ",depression

I also became very jealous of her. Compared myself to her, then realized it's very unhealthy to compare yourself to others. We all have a great uniqueness about ourselves.

I kept pushing him away, telling him he should try to work things out with her. She was the one who ended the relationship, so I immediately thought he was still in love with her. I'm so confused.

I have been having a terrible time with my career.  I went to therapy this week and talked to my counselor about how much stress I have been under (and this is Spring Break) because the school where I work is so terrible and overwhelming. I'm exposed to violence, I've had my picture taken of me and put online (behind my back) and numerous other things.  I can hardly cope. I was freaking out while doing my grading and planning and wondering how I was going to cope, when yes, you guessed it, the school has closed down for a minimum of another week.  This is terrible but I was actually jumping for joy (not because people could get sick, that's terrible) but because it gets me out of this horrible situation!  This gives me the opportunity to work on finding another position, and the opportunity to keep working on the other courses I have been taking to change my career.
One of the last discussions that we had in the lunchroom was how awful things were going and the terrible atmosphere, when I jokingly (sort of) said that the Coronavirus was going to level everything-the teacher getting punched among other things.  Nobody was doing ANYTHING to help,  and now it's happened. It is pretty perverse and ironic but I was so horribly depressed thinking about another day of this, but that will be postponed or-there may not be another day!!

Desperately wanting to help/support my fiancée,"New here, and really looking for any support I can get, as try and navigate what is turning into chronic depression that my beautiful fiancée suffers from. 
We met in the Army, and recently returned from a deployment together.  We battled through her flare ups while deployed, which generally included her shutting down and withdrawing from all interactions.  She'd push me away for moments, but eventually feel better and comeback. It wasn't always easy, but I gradually learned the warning signs, and to anticipate the fall out while we dated.  Shortly before our tour ended, I proposed, and she said yes!  After that things were great until about 2 weeks after we both returned home.  Her mom was in a terrible car accident, badly breaking bones in her leg, requiring extensive surgery.  My fiancé and I spent the better part of a week, post-accident, at the hospital caring for her mother. (this would also be the first time I'd meet my future mother in law.)
I could tell almost instantly that the emotion from seeing her mother in pain and suffering took a toll on her.  I could also see her looking ahead to her road to recovery, and analyzing all of the things she felt like she'd have to care for and arrange while her mom recovered, and that took a toll on her.  The darkness crept back in, and took over. 
It's important to note that we are currently about 6 hours apart, as her mom lives in the Southeat US, while I'm located in the Midwest.  Adding an LDR isn't helping, I""m sure. 
Fast forward to today, or within the last couple of weeks, and she has struggled dealing with the dynamic at home with her mom's needs, and her younger siblings needs, coupled with some unnecessary family drama that irritates her. A few weeks ago she broke down and had suicidal thoughts, and told me she didn't want to do it (it referring to US) anymore, and that ""we were done, and it's final.""  I didn't panic and instead reassured her that I wasn't leaving, that I loved her, and would fight along side her as we battled this.  I also reached out to her boss on the deployment, whom she revered as a motherly figure, and shared my concerns with her.  Her boss proceeded to reach out to her and talk with her, and helped to pull her, temporarily, from the abyss.  My fiancé later called me, apologized, told me she loved me, and we moved forward. 
This weekend she was here with me, as we had drill together, and I could tell she was off.  I didn't push anything, and just did what I always do and loved on and supported her, reassuring her often.  Then today, after she went on a drinking binge with friends, told me again that she ""couldn't do it anymore(US).  As before, I didn't panic, and continued to reassure her and support her, and reinforce my commitment to her, and like last time, she acknowledged her love for me, but didn't want to drag me down, and that she had ""made up her mind.""
So today has been a struggle, as I don't know if I'm actually losing her, or if this is her coping the only way she knows how, by pushing everyone and everything away.  My gut tells me it's the latter, and I'm confident in her love for me.  I'm posting here because I feel unsure with just how to help and support her.  Do I give her space, even when she says it's not what it is this time?  Do I continue to reach out and show my unending love and support?  
I love this woman more than anything, and can't wait to marry her......I just want to help her, and I don't always feel like I know how. ",depression
I may have just made a collosal mistake...,"I have been trying to move out of my mother's house, ever since I recovered memories of her abusing me as a child. Well, today, a roof salesman came by, I asked if she wanted to talk to him, and she said she did. (Our roof's been leaking like crazy, or I would have just said no.) He made his pitch, and somehow I let myself get roped into cosigning the loan. Now I'm liable for helping her make the monthly payments, to the tune of $500/month.
I know it's because of my codependant nature, but I am beginning to lose hope in myself. I feel like every time I try to get ahead, either something happens to block me or I shoot myself in the foot. I feel like the only way I'll ever get out of this house is by dying, and my life is never going to go anywhere because I just don't have what it takes. This came just after learning that hours are being cut at work, so I'll be down to $800/month for the forseeable future, and I doubt I have the mental and emotional fortitude for two jobs right now. These last few weeks have been very stressful, very hard, and I don't know if I can take anymore. Right now, I really want to die. While I'm going to just sleep on it, be patient, and see how it goes, does anyone else have any thoughts/suggestions?",depression

Is this guy friend really a friend ???,"This situation (see the text sent below) and the absolutely disappointment and irrational anger ( from me with alcohol involved to confront him ). When I confronted my roommate and acted out on what felt like was a betrayal, has now been a huge blow on our friendship (he ignores me even more) and now I just feel more uncomfortable and this only makes life less desirableas;this was my last on friend in life ( I have NO support system at all ) I moved here because he said he wanted to help me (I absolutely trusted this man) and he knows I get deeply depressed and have been struggling to make it and then this happens and I am stuck in sadness and feel in checkmate with my depression ... can someone give me advice on this IM I sent him (confronting  him) and tell me if I mentally and emotionally am wrong for being so hurt. I have known this person on and off for years. 
Text: : I apologize for my upset tone with you this morning. However, please read on & I hope you understand. I was thinking about when you asked me, as your friend, to come visit you when I was in Goldendale and I did. While we were out, you had a change of plans because you wanted to hangout with your different ""friends"" & you had me drive to your house & wait for you for over 8 hours. Well, I still allowed myself to forgive you. Then a week or so ago, we had plans & then you changed your plans because you wanted to go out with your other ""friends "" & then again you did it last night. You stood this friend up to be with your other ""friends ""; again. It is not like we hangout much to began with anyway. Last night when your ""friend"" loudly asked if those sun glasses were yours, all you could say is ""no, it her's"" It sounded like you were upset to be referencing me. That's when I realized you really don't think of me as a friend. However, you were happy to reference me as your housekeeper maybe even the gardener but, not a friend. Last night when your ""friend"" loudly sounded to reference me, the other person told her to hush and your ""friend ""said loudly, I don't give a fuck who hears me. When I came in from smoking, you all became very quiet but, as you already informed me, you had no intentions of me meeting any friends right now. So, I made no plans to interrupt. The silence was hurtful. I am hurt more than upset & not because of your ""friends "" came to see you but more on how it's always done. Yes, upset that you had me come here in such an uncomfortable position. I already had a job & a place to stay, although I would have had to get a second job or I could have traveled one more time because I had the money to move permanently. Instead, I believed in you & yes I, followed your advice. Now I am financially stuck & I don't know what to do. I never thought I would become the 3rd wheel & I am so embarrassed that I even thought that you thought of me as a friend.",depression
selfish,"ever feel bad or selfish, cuz you don't really wanna talk to anyone, cuz you don't feel good and think they don't really wanna talk to you either, or think they're just gonna say something about how you don't sound good, or just criticize what you say or how you sound?  I've always been pretty introverted, and not great w/ppl...as I get older and everyone has kids, well, I'm not good w/kids either. :/  my dad said it's my nephews bday, if I wanted to call...I wasn't feeling good anyway, and said he probably doesn't wanna talk to me...he was like sure he would.  I've only seen them a few times, and they're nice and everything, but I feel like they probably wouldn't care.  every time he puts them on the phone and says ""say hi to ___""  I feel like they don't really care, like oh here's the weird aunt again we have to talk to, haha.  I try to seem friendly and nice, and the younger one seems to like me more, but I think the older one's catching on to what a loser I am, haha.  so that's why I figure he probably wouldn't care, and would probably just get more annoyed at having to talk to me again...
Idk...does that make me a jerk?  or would they probably not even care or notice, as I suspect?",depression
Unhealthy relationship,"I recently told my mom that she was acting like she was prior to being on bipolar medicine. Very verbally abusive and passive aggressive. 
She responded to her daughter that she knows already struggles with depression, PTSD and anxiety by telling me the apply might not fall far from the tree and maybe I should see a doctor because I might be bipolar. And that because she's fucked up in the head I must be as well. 
The saddest part is that she really doesn't think that there is anything wrong with saying that to anyone let alone your daughter.

Mom depressed- what to do,"My question is about my mom who has been depressed for over a year.  She's an intense person who's been interested in social standing.  She lives at a high-end resort community in Scottsdale, Arizona with my dad (married for over 50 years).   They previously got along reasonably well because they led their own lives but now spend most of their time together and get on each other's nerves.  She complains that he has vision problems and is losing it a little mentally which is true. However, people who meet him generally find him pleasant and upbeat.  Behind closed doors, she is intense and critical, and wants to tell people how bad he's doing, which seems unproductive because people find him pleasant though realizing his vision is compromised and he is getting older.  She says she wants her old life back but obviously we can't turn back the clock.  She now spends most of her time complaining about him, and saying how hard it is, when people would note, many women have lost their husbands and others have far worse health problems.  Her health seems reasonably good.  She is a ""the glass is half empty and this is extremely serious, we need to so something about this immediately"" type of person.  How should I approach this for her sake and equally important for my dad.    ",depression
Am I really depressed?,"Hey everyone,

I'm new to DS and I've been reading a lot of you in different groups and I've automatically have felt some relief in knowing a site like this exists where there are others going through similar things yet completely different issues and processes of life. I would described myself as someone that looks and seems to have their life together, but the older I get (recently turned 30) life situations and inconveniences such as moving cities, getting a new job, having no real friends in this new city, having stopped working out as of one year and just yesterday breaking up with someone after 4 months- it all has just reminded me of how much I've been neglecting myself and how empty I feel. These feelings have always been in my life in some sort of way, but it is always right after I end a romantic relationship that it all hits me in the face once again. I do feel lonely, not the type of loneliness of not having a partner, but empty in my soul. Does not matter how many material things I buy, it does not matter how well I am doing in my professional life or how much my family loves me; I feel empty. As of lately I've been revaluating my life in all aspects in a way that I become so emotionally exhausted because it feels like I'm beating myself up in a way. I am empty, yet the voices in my head do not stop, my conscience or however you would like to call it. I understand I was born alone and that I will die alone and I'm fine with that, but it is just knowing that having a life without meaningful connection is where I am missing experiencing feeling ""alive"" in a way. For the most part I feel dead inside. I am aware that it might be not having any hobbies at the moment besides gaming my life away for my brain to not think of how I truly feel. Then again, I see this as a very unhealthy coping mechanism, alongside having a romantic relationship and making that the ""light"" in my life. I do not have suicidal thoughts or self harming thoughts. For the most part I do put a persona just to get through the day and I'm always counting the hours to go back to my cave where I'm unbothered. 

I want to apologize for me ranting right now and being a little over the place with what I'm going through, but letting it all out might be a first step. IM TERRIFIED of life passing me by and feeling like I haven't lived. Time is precious, but I feel stuck as if I'm not becoming a better version of myself with no energy to put some effort into finding meaning in my life. I do not expect to find happineed, but would like to find meaning in my life and a glimpse of happy moments provided by such meaningful life.
Thank you to all of you for reading all of this. It makes me feel better to know I'm not alone in this constant search of a better self and better quality of life. I always like to remind myself that ""this too shall pass"" and it will. Blessings to all of you!",depression
Thank You!,"I just wanted to thank you all so very much!! 
Never had so many words felt like actual hugs. After reading and re-reading what you all wrote on my last post about freaking out, it really helped me. I did some shopping for food and other supplies today and just tried my best to relax. I also called and chat with my sister. 
Thank you, everyone, for your help and for listening to me. it was very comforting reading what everyone had to say. My anxiety and depression have still been both attacking me but with lots of deep breathing and staying connected with my sister I feel much calmer. with this virus, I haven't really been afraid for myself. my health doesn't enter my mind to be concerned with. I'm more concerned about my mother and sister. My mom just turned 50 this year and I worry a lot about her health. My sister isn't that much older than me. I'm 20 and my sister is almost 27 but I am worried about her because she is pregnant. I am too worried about them and not about myself. 
I'm just glad right now I'm feeling better. I can now make sure my mom and others are ok. I want to help people feel the peace I feel right now. While I was outside today the trees, grass, clouds, birds, squirrels just it all seemed so peaceful and for a moment everything felt fine. I must not forget that. 
It is very sad thinking about all the people that die from this virus. but in the end, things will be ok. those people that die, they are at peace now. 
I love you all and I am truly grateful for all your kind words. re-reading what you all wrote has helped me with today.",depression
Overwhelmed,"I am freaking out!
All that is happening because of the coronavirus. This is making my depression worse and my anxiety. I've been having more panic attacks. Before the coronavirus became an issue I have always been paranoid about everything. but now I'm even more paranoid and scared. I'm experiencing a panic more and more. I feel so overwhelmed I feel sick to my stomach. I might throw up from all this stress and anxiety. Never have my anxiety and depression been so strong at the same time. I have been feeling suicidal and so overwhelmed with it all. Today just made everything worse. At first, I wasn't so worried. However today my church sent an email saying they are closing the church worldwide and since my church is taking this seriously this makes me more afraid. Maybe all the people that are buying toilet paper are doing the smart thing, since before my friend thought it was a waste of time. But now my full panic mood is kicking in and I need to go to the store and buy toilet paper and supplies. maybe it's not necessary but it will make me feel somewhat better. Just being prepared just incase makes my anxiety less extreme. My college might be closed too next week and then it will be an online school.
Right now I'm just kinda venting while panicking. I just need all these thoughts out my head... I am terrified since anything can happen now. I just google coronavirus and it came up an SOS Alert. I feel so overwhelmed... I'm just one small person and this coronavirus is such a big thing that I can not fix. It also makes me so anxious because no one knows how long this coronavirus will be a problem. Will it take months or years for this to go away and everything back to normal? and how many more people will die? Will we have a summer? everything is gonna change. everything is already changing... I'm scared. If schools are closing are jobs gonna close? will we all just be in our homes forever? I'm terrified. I had such a horrible panic attack today that my heart was having more pain than usual. when I have panic attacks my heart does hurt but this time it was an extreme amount of pressure. 
It's really hard to get my mind to stop all these thoughts. I know I must just focus on the things I can control, like going shopping tomorrow even if it's not necessary but it will make me feel better. I will make a list of items to buy and hopefully, the stores will have more of the items I need since I know the stores are running out of stuff.
I just want things to be ok. I just want to be ok. I just want everyone to be ok.

Depressed about animal cruelty,"I've been depressed about animal cruelty, about the horrors of the factory farms/slaughterhouses.  I won't go into details here but it very very very bad. It makes me so sad and is actually one the things that depresses me the most in my life.  If I thought all animals were free to live out their natural lives in nature I would feel such incredible joy and relief.  
I was vegetarian for about 10 years  and then i slipped and started eating meat again for another 10 years or so.  I've been transistioning off meat and am now starting veganism.  That doesn't seem like enough to me though because it's kind of like a drop in the bucket.  So, I am going to try to contact some of the animal welfare places like Farm Sanctuary and see how i can get more involved. 
i am very sad and frustrated because i want it to stop now, right away.  it's a holocaust and needs to be fought.  that's how i feel.  there's no difference between a cat or a dog or a cow or a pig or a chicken etc.  they are all sentient beings who are aware and intelligent and feel pain and fear.  how can we ignore what is going on?  
well it's partly because it's hidden.  all you see are the neat and tidy packages at the grocery store.  i feel like we need to get past this.  to think about what is behind that packaging and what is really going on.
does anyone else become depressed about this?  is anyone on here vegan?  is there a site on daily strength about this topic?   it's all very disturbing and i want to find some way to be productive and work towards correcting it.

New Here,"Ever cry and not know exactly what's wrong? That's me every night. I've lost so much in my life and I know my problems isn't greater than anyone else. I just don't know how to over come mine. I was in a relationship for 5 years. He treated me like crap but I stayed. He cheated a lot but iguess I don't love myself and that's why I stayed. He is now in a relationship with someone else that he treats way better than he did me and I wonder why. What was wrong with me..
once we broke up, I met a wonderful guy. He was so good to me but I was so wrapped up on my ex( was still talking to him ). I hurt this wonderful guy so bad and didn't realize how much I did until he ended things. I feel so bad. I feel like I lost someone that saw me and loved me for who I was but my insecurities are so bad that I pushed him away. Now he is in a relationship and he's happy. I miss him so much..
I just feel like everyone is better off with me out of their life. I feel so alone and empty. I don't have many good friends. They all just use me for what I can do for them. I'm always checking up on everyone and no one ever checks up on me. I feel hopeless",depression

update,"hi, its been like a week since i last posted in this group.  everyone was so nice when i talked about my abusive and homophobic dad, which really helped because ive been feeling really alone and i felt like i couldn't talk to anyone about this.  lately its been ok at home. last weekend i went to a concert with my friend, my dad make a comment on how i was dressing and how i ""deserve"" the negative attention i might get and he also made me wash my face because i put some makeup on. i was only wearing skinny jeans, a shirt, this pink vinyl jacket, black boots and a choker... i just felt bad about myself and insecure after he said that. but i still had fun with my friend. i feel like i always have to hide how i feel and how bad my home life is with my friends.  the friend i went to the concert with is also gay and his parents are really supportive and i guess im just jealous.. i just feel numb to it at this point. and the worst part was that when i was in the city for the concert, this group of guys catcalled me and kept staring at my uh.. pants area and i felt like my dad was right and that i deserved it... i was really uncomfortable and i didnt really feel safe. but everything turned out ok and i got home safe
its just been hard lately. my dad isnt getting a lot of hours at his job cuz of the virus so he's home a lot and now i have to change the way i am and act more ""masculine"" the second i get home and its so exhausting.. i just wish i can be myself. i usually deal with this by distracting myself and staying at my friends house or going to work. so i hope i can do that this week ):",depression
I called a number,"I finally decided to call the National Suicide Hotline. I didn't harm myself or have plans to, but i do have days i just want to stay in the bed and cry and be alone. But after putting it off for so long, i finally called the number. The guy i talked to was nonjudgemental and nice. And i just needed to talk to someone that was family. I don't want to worry them, they know i'm depressed and sad. And they do check up on me. And i'm eternally grateful for that. But when i was on the line with the hotline, i heard myself admit i was depressed and sad and itime to time have suicidal thoughts. I've never self harmed myself, i value life. But sometimes i forget that. But it was therapeutic to hear myself tell a stranger my inner thoughts. And i feel better because of that call. To anyone reading this. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

I have nothing to live for,"Why, what is the point? I have no real close friends. I have no family to speak of, my parents are insane (literally) so they are no support. My daughter is wrapped up in her own life and I rarely see my granddaughter.......with the way that my daughter parents I would rather not be included. I am a good person I am helpful and caring and I put others first most of the time. My husband is not able to support, encourage, or connect with me (mild autism) I do it all. I make our lives work I make the business work I make the household work, I am tired of it.I am tired of fighting with all of it.........the little things like an email that I had worked on throughout the day yesterday just erased itself. Even though I had saved it repeatedly, fighting with beauracracy. Fighting to keep my head above water so I don't drown. Fighting to come up with the anwers - how to make the money last through this latest crisis. Tired of everytime we get ahead something comes to take it away. I have no ""vision"" of the future. I used to love love love my job, but not that it is so HEAVILY regulated there is just no reason to do it anymore. My daughter has gone on this minimalist kick.........so all the wonderful things that I have collected over the years will just go into a dumpster when I am dead. It will be like I never even exsisted. No matter how loving and kind I am........it makes no difference to anyone........they all just leave eventually. 
I have nothing to look forward too, I have nothing that I want to ""aspire"" too. I will never have a home (I mean that in the bigger sense)  I will never had granchildren to play with and bake with and cuddle and teach and grow with. Not because I am depressed. Its why I am depressed. Truth is if I got hit by a bus tomorrow........no one would really care. OK hubby would because then he would not be able to fix the books or keep the bank accounts or take care of himself. My inlaws would be sad I am sure....but they'd get over it. As for anyone else I know they would maybe (unlikely) shed a tear and quickly move on. This is not on me........I reach out.......I took a ""friend"" to luch 3 times in the last few months because her husband has cancer and I wanted her to know I understand and to support her. 10 yrs ago when my husband had cancer she vanished from my life. Last month I did all the ""Christmas baking"" (dec was too busy) I made up baskets and took them to the office and to friends for Valentines. I thought it would brighten everyones day and make them feel wanted and special. I basically didn't even get a thank you aside from the oh what a lovely idea (said with shock mostly) 
I am still fighting to stay alive......but I really have no good reason too. I am thinking that I am a moot point so why keep putting in the effort? Sorry didn't mean to ramble for so long here is my question.
What is the point of life? What are you living for? Working for? Hoping for?  Because really I can't come up with one single reason anymore.

Depressed,"I just joined this group today. I used to have so many people I could talk to about things that were bothering me. My mom was the main person I could always find comfort in. Now she has a boyfriend, is barely home, and my dad is officially homeless living out of his car. My sister recently went through a divorce and lives out of state..we hardly talk. My brother has had so many legal and mental health problems over the last few years and blames it on me for reasons I'll never quite understand. I have no friends. I can't say I've been good at reaching out to people though so I blame that on myself. I clean houses for a living but it's not a good source of income. im 30 years old living in my moms condo, wanting to sleep the days away. Sometimes I have to come up with a story of what I did all day so she doesn't know I was in bed sleeping my life away. I take Prozac for anxiety/depression...but the only time I know it's helping is when I go days without taking it. It's chronic panic attacks. So the Prozac has helped me overcome my panic attacks but my depression remains. Sometimes I feel super happy and motivated then all of a sudden it's like a dark cloud comes over me and I feel empty and lonely inside. It's very difficult to live this way. ",depression

I just broke down, my mum and I have a good relationship and are close but talking about this with her I find to be very difficult.. but anyways so I did and I told her and she said she would come get me at work, and take me to her work so I could talk to someone. She is actually an addictions counselor for interior health. So the next thing I had to do was tell my boss about this, now that was very hard for me to do.. however she is was understanding about it and I was able to leave. So I went to my mums work and I met with an in take (who is stand in counselor till I can get a counselor ) who my mum knows and I got to talk with him and honestly I balled and cried my eyes out as I talked with him.. it honestly felt so nice to be able to let everything out.. I'm meeting him again next week on friday, and Saturday I'm going to the walk in clinic with my mum and getting meds. I was on meds before but than my doctor left and i ran out and i couldnt afford it anymore so i cut cold turkey.. so today was the first day I didnt feel like crying, however I did have a brief moment where a negative thought came and I wanted to cry.. I know this isnt going to be easy but I'm going try and take my life back.. ",depression

My mind is so tired. how can all these thoughts come from just stressed out about studying???? at first, that was only it. I was just stressed out about studying, but now these thoughts have to lead to something else. now I feel so exhausted and angry and I want to feel physical pain. I just want it all to go away. I feel so alone. so extremely alone. why don't people seem to care about me anymore? and why am I so alone all the time? I wish my mind would just shut up!!! and leave me alone.",depression
Rock Bottom,"I've been struggling a lot recently with depression and anxiety. So much has happened recenlty and I finally cracked. My brother was murdered a few weeks ago, I have severe anxiety with work becuase it is a high pressure job that I moved hafway across the country for and my husband was diagnised as HIV+. This is just since September. There's so much more if I started going back furthur.
I've alway been ""the strong one"", the one who can handle anything and I am always there for everyone. Everyone except myself, that is. I've set aside my own feelings and it finally cuaght up with me. I struggle to get to sleep at night and get out of bed everyday. I'm scared to open my work phone and computer because I start getting panic attacks and I'm scared I won't be able to continue to work this job which will bring about a bunch of financial issues. I'm scared for my husband's health adn well-being. I'm scared that he is going to resent me if I quit my job and take a lower-paying one. I'm scared he isn't going to want me anymore becuase I'm not the strong, ambitious person I used to be. I'm devisated over the loss of my brother becuase I am now the last surviving member of my immediate family. I feel so alone even though I have my husband and two cousins close. 
Back in december I started having panic attacks and faling into a deep depression, so I sought help. I got a psychiatrist and was put on meds, I was going to therapy. I thought I was getting better and learning how to cope with everything that has happened but then my brother was killed and I went back into ""strong one"" mode. I took time off from work and the day before I was supposed to go back I started prepping for my week and I lost it. I had a horrible panic attack and fell down as far as I've ever gone. I ended uo asking my husband to take me to the hospital and was kept overnight in the psychiatric wing. It was one of the scariest moments in my life and I can't let myself get that bad again.  
I'm trying to get back on track but its been so hard trying to organize doctor's visits or try and find support groups that meet soon. I just want to talk to someone who can help me cope and bounce back from this.

There's always another low,"I'm 26 and i've suffered with depression since i was 15. I know it's going to be a lifelong thing, something i'm going to have to manage. Which that alone is a depressing thought. I live in Canada, so i'm blessed to have free healthcare, meaning i can see my doctor for free and there are some free mental health workers and psychiatrists. The mental health workers that are free have basic training, have a bunch of cases and tend to be for more short term problems. They have very black and white thinking. Which makes it hard to engage in counseling. The psychiatrists have crazy long wait lists and are very particular about who they see. 
My diagnosis went from depression to addition of anxiety then i was told i wasn't depressed (by a psychiatrist) because i still had a job, then i filled out a quiz that said i was bipolar so he diagnosed me with bipolar type 2. No medication combo worked. Did that for about 4 years. After several stays at a psychiatric unit and a suicide attempt, and seeing 3 different psychiatrists, my diagnosis got changed to borderline. Then it got changed to dysthymia with intermittent episodes of major depression with anxiety and complex trauma disorder.
So all i know is depression and anxiety and a bunch of scars of trauma. I was lucky to be able to move in with my aunt last year when i started a two-year college program. And with that, I was able to afford to pay for a private counselor. Which was the best decision. She is great. I've cut out a lot of my toxic family. I still work full time and am a full time student, so to say i'm busy is an understatement. And it worked out really well for the last year and half. I graduate in June and i've crashed. So i'm trying to get on the list to see a psychiatrist to get new medication recommendations, but since i see a private counselor that is considerably harder. I see my counselor twice a month which cost me $200/month, but things are bad, and i really could benefit with more visit, but at $100/visit, it's not plausible. And now i've started to have a bunch of physical symptoms of mental illnesses, my muscles aches, i'm getting constant migraines, so on top of my mental health being poor, i'm sick, and missing work. Which cuts into my budget. So to remedy the physical symptoms i need to do physio and massage, but that's all out of pocket cost, plus my portions of my prescriptions cost me about $100/month. So my mental health, on a typical month cost me close to $600, add missing work to that. 
My aunt is great as in she lets me live with her, but she doesn't understand mental illness. If i need to take a day to myself, because i'm overwhelmed from worked 80 hours and being in class for 28 hours/ bi weekly and spending probably 20 hours biweekly on homework, she doesn't understand why i need a day. So my life is falling apart, and i can't afford to put it back together. And yeah i know it'll pass. But i know another low is on the horizon. 
I'm so grateful to live in a country that has free healthcare, don't get me wrong, but i can't afford my life-long mental illnesses. ",depression

Feeling down tonight,i'm in my fifties.  work more than full time.  major depression.  very little support or money to work with.  body breaking down.  i post here all the time.  don't have anywhere else to go.  so tired.  my body hurts all over.  i need a hug.  i wish there was someone here to hug me and tell me everything was going to be ok.  of course it won't but funny how when someone says that it is so comforting.  i live in a daze of exhaustion and depression.  I alternate between feeling like zombie and being in a rage.  wish i didn't have to go to work tomorrow.  it's too hard.,depression
"A Dark, Heavy Cloud that Wants to Rain","Everyone experiences depression and its symptoms differently. For me, when my less intense depression presents itself, there is a creeping sense of hopelessness, fatigue, overwhelm, and general inability to function the way my otherwise aggressively productive and eager self would. I usually don't even notice that I'm depressed, I just feel like things have become hard. Of course, that's how minor depression is. However, when my major depression hits, that shit is not mistakable. That's my Dark and Heavy cloud. This is when I totally stop being able to function. 
The Cloud is like this:
* illogical, but can be (easily) triggered from outside events
* fear and panic-inducing
* ultimate sadness to my innermost core
* ultimate hopelessness to my innermost core
* saps 100% of energy (I just lay down and can't get up)

I basically become a ball of pain and despair. My husband, bless his lovely soul, tries what he can to help me. I don't know how I would make it through these times without him and/or my service dog, Deluna. The Cloud generally stays until I either sleep or take some medicinal plant- either cannabis or white/green kratom or kava. My reliance on Kratom has become pretty intensive recently just to exist. I'm not taking huge doses, but I'm taking a moderate dose twice a day just to get by and to keep the Cloud at bay so that I can run my dog training/care business, which 100% requires a certain amount of positivity and energy. (If I am walking a reactive dog and there is an above-threshold reaction, barking and lunging, and I already have a Cloud or am not in a 90% good mood, things get dangerous for me. Like immediately go hurt myself contemplate suicide dangerous.) 

So, these past few days (when I'm not being helped by kratom), the Cloud has been pretty perpetual and I just want to cry. I mean, like, all the time. The constant urge to cry and just feeling so incredibly broken is so sad and debilitating. All of this makes it so hard to do what I love and to run my business. The perpetual feeling that I'm going to lose it all is oppressive. 

So my question is- is this normal for major depression? I'm coming to terms with the reality that I might really need more help than I realized. ",depression
A lifetime of sacrifice....,"Hi, I've just joined the group and would like to say hello to everyone on the forum.
I have read a couple of posts and I like to express my empathy with your depression.
Today I've felt quite depressed in that I have come to the realisation that I have spent a lifetime of sacrifice to care for my elderly parents till my father's death, and continue to care for my aging mother. I have sacrificed my youth, my career, my education and any relationships that I ever have, for the health and happiness of my parents. Now that I have reached my mid year, I have nothing to show for it but old age, an unspectacular career, an ordinary education, and no mutual relationships with anyone.
I normally suppress my depression because it is not healthy for me to engage with my depression, but today, looking back at the correspondence from nasty people who try to pull me down, I just feel quite depressed at the moment. I don't know what to do with this feeling. I normally don't allow myself to feel this way but think my way out of it.
I hope to receive your advice as to what I should do to get myself out of this abyss of depression. Thank you for your help. Maree

talking to my doctor today,"Hey guys. I'm seeing my doctor today to talk about medication, specifically Celexa (Citolophram). I have depression and anxiety and I struggle with a lot of dissociation. My therapist very much thinks I would benefit from trying a medication like this. I have been battling this at its worst for over a year now. Does anyone have any experience with this medication? I know everyone's body is different but I am so afraid of getting side effects. If my dissociation or anxiety got any worse I'm not sure how I'd manage. I already am so frustrated and can't stand it. I'm going to post this message on the anxiety group too since it pertains to both. ",depression
Rough time,"I dont expect to get sympathy or anything from this post i just need to vent somewhere i know that people can relate.  I am now about 6 months out of a 5 year relationship.  The last time i saw my x was first week in feb.  I cannot move on.  This was a bad relationship too.  He basically ignored me, never wanted to do things with me, wasnt there for me when i needed him.  So when HE left (yup he left) it shoul dhave been good riddance.  But we had a plan to get married and move into a house.  When he out of the blue dropped the news that he was moving out and he had already gotten his own apt i was so devastaed.  My entire life plan was changed.  I no longer had any idea what to do.  I had seen him a few times since he left sept 30th.  Always the same story, oh i miss u so much but this is such a big commitment idk if i can get mrried now.  I am too young bla bla bla (hes 32).  And then he disappears and i dont hear from him.  The last time we spoke and saw eachother he is now seeing other people.  But the same story comes up where he cries says hes so confused then disappears.  He has now blocked my number.  Again, i dont know why i am so sad about this.  I should be rejoicing and moving forward happily.  But i cant even date.  I have a tough time just enjoying my life.  I notice everything reminds me of him.  I think abotu him and whoever he may be dating constantly.  I am in therapy and i am also on meds (for panic disorder previously diagnosed).  I just cannot move forward.  He was my life.  And now its like my life was ripped away and left me there to bleed out.",depression
It feels like I'm drowning,"I started the year off in a bad situation but my situation gave me motivation. Lately I can feel it seeping from my body. I've been slipping deeper and deeper into my own brain and finally sent a message to my ex-bast friend whom I still love deeply but haven't spoken to in 10+ years. I don't really know why I sent it and I didn't really expect an answer back, but she did message me back. She only wanted to tell me that there were no hard feelings and she wished me the best. That's not what I wanted. I just wanted to her to say she missed me too. I just wanted her to want me back in her life. I feel like I spilled my heart out and got a little pat on the head in return. And I know she doesn't owe me anything, and she's entitled to her feelings too, but I just wish it was different. I've made so many bad decisions. I haven't been good to the people that have been good to me and now I can't fix it. And then I go back a forth because I feel like I was treated badly too. I don't know what to do. I don't have a good support system and I 'm not good at making friends. I really just would like to be different. I don't want it to be a struggle to do normal things like, make dinner or go play with my kids or clean up the house. I wish I wasn't so damn tired all the time. I don't want to question wether I'm making a good decision or a bad one. I'd like to be certain about things instead of always guessing. I wish someone would just choose me and keep choosing me. I wish I didn't have to keep convincing myself that I'm capable of doing it and I'm worthy of it getting done. My poor kid's deserve so much better. I've screwed up their lives so much. I can see how I've damaged them. I can see where they're struggling and how it's my fualt. I wish that wasnt hard too. Everything feels pretty overwhelming right now and it's getting harder to cope.  ",depression
Trying to care for husband,"My husband suffers from depression. So do I, except mine is not as severe. I feel like he has something more complicated than major depressive disorder which is his dx. (Not saying MDD isn't complex!) 
He initially was dx as bipolar after a suicide scare years ago. Later after mood stabilizers did nothing he was told it was a misdiagnosis. They said he has ADHD and depression. I do agree. However.. I wonder if anyone has experience with the specifics that I see with him. He has what I call two gears. Low and Park. Most weeks he goes to work, helps taxi the kids after and that's about it. If not taxiing, after work he watches TV from his chair or bed and looks at his phone. Then there are Sat and Sun. He usually stays in bed from Fri night until Monday morning. He calls the kids and I in to snuggle, chat, etc. But that's about it. He eats.. and snacks a lot. Once in a while, though, he will do ""normal"" weekend things but then he will call in sick for 2 to 3 days after. He says he is tired. He won't take his meds. And if he misses 2 doses of cymbalta he gets cruel. Verbally abusive, short fused. Apologies for the extra long post. Thanks",depression
End of a happy set of days,"I'm new here and my girlfriend suggested this website to me. So some background, I'm a master's student who has been on and off of medication for anxiety for years now, and at the beginning of the semester I started them again.  I was feeling great this past month.  I stopped going out drinking, i started music lessons I look forward to every week and I look forward to going to practice my instrument everyday before work.  I was so focused on trying to make myself feel better I slacked on my school work, not paying attention to where stuff is submitted online and when its due ect.  Well, today I got an email from one of my professors that I had a number of missing assignments and it was unacceptable and to get my act together.  And she was completely right.  I took this really hard and was shattered that was falling behind in school, that I dont belong here.  I tried hurting myself and now my hand is covered in sores and scratches, and I wasnt going to eat all day as punishment but my girlfriend convinced me to.  I said some stuff that I think made her upset like she would be better with out me.  I need to apologize for scaring her and let her know how much she means to me.",depression
Hard decisions,"Hey guys, I haven't posted in awhile but I'd like to be more involved in this webpage from here on out. 
For as long as I can remember my mom has always been bipolar and very up and down. Constantly. Growing up she took care of my sister and I for the majority of our lives but she was never there for us. And a lot of the time when she was there she was abusive to us. My sister has an opportunity to move in with her dad but I didn't have that option. I was stuck living with my mom until I graduated high school. 

On four major physical altercations, which were not the only ones, there altercations ended with police involvement. Not a single time did I touch my mom in any way other then self defense. But she would but my in choke holds, punch me, throw me on the ground, rip me down the stairs, etc. Each time the police were called my mom said I was beating her and they told me that my mom could put any hand she wants on my because I can't touch her. The first time the police were called I was in 8th grade, she sat on my chest on the stairs until the police got there bc she thought I was going to run away. When the police showed up she said I beat the crap out of her but I was the one that was covered in scratches and bruises and a black eye. I sat at the police station for five hours and they ended up not having a bed for me so my mom said I could come home. The minute I walked in the door the police asked if she still wanted to press charges or if she wanted to drop them, she looked at me and said no she wanted to press charges. 
Even though I no longer live with her and the physical abuse no longer happens, now she is very verbally abusive and very passive aggressive. 
i don't want to have toxic relationships in my life anymore because they only make me sad. I want to be surrounded by happiness and love always. 
It's extremely hard to make this choice because she is my mom. Anyone have any advice? Anyone been through something similar? Feeling really alone through this :/",depression

need advice,"Quickly a little background.
Hubby fell off of our trailer at work and broke his wrist we have been off of work for 2 months and it will be at least another 2 months before we might be able to return to work. But it could possibly be way more time then that.
So we are needless to say short of money. We are getting enough in insurance payments to cover the basics.  But I cannot afford anything else. 
Here is my delima. My daughter (27)  and I have had a cell family share plan since she was 15, to save money.......but she is supposed to pay for her portion which see has maybe 6 times. Her husband has been out of work since December, so she also has no extra money....I have been trying to be helpful to them and I just pay the entire bill. Although for a long time now.......like 7 yrs it really shouldn't  have been my responsibility. 
But I feel like I SHOULD be helping her. She has an 18 month old and well...I know what its like to be young and a new mom and a new wife and try to burn the candle at both ends....etc.
I can't afford to pay for her phone anymore. I don't want too. I am tired of them always spending spending spending. I agreed to pay their rent last month. Daughter basically doens't even speak to me unless its too ask for money. I am using this I know to try and hold onto her and so that I can get to see granddaughter. But I just can't do it anymore. I have a business that I could lose and a home and a life. She keeps going over her data limit and it is costing too much money. Her excuse the baby turned off her wifi......last month ohhh they were out so often that baby used up all her data. 
I know I should ""grow up"" and just say no but it is really hard -- why ? I don't want her to be angry with me........I want to feel like I am still her mom and I still do things for her. But I want to make memories with her not just pay her off. 
I have been really depressed and I just don't know if I can stand the confrontation either........any thoughts......am I just being stupid should I just stand up for myself. ",depression
How to deal with a friend who doesn't understand?,"My best friend of 50 years has seen me through a lot over the decades.  I know she doesn't understand anything about depression, anxiety and PTSD and I don't expect her to, but sometimes it's really difficult explaining why I feel the way I do or can't do things at times. I was in the hospital from last Thursday to Tuesday and called her to tell her I was going home the night before I left. I originally planned on staying longer but this admission made me more anxious and agitated due to the noise level on the unit and staff issues and decided it was too toxic for me to stay. I had already put in a 72 hour notice Saturday along with 4 other people; that alone says a lot. I have been there before and usually had productive stays.My friend was shocked I was leaving so soon and had also been upset that I had started TMS a few weeks ago and didn't stay with it very long; I just couldn't tolerate it at the time. 
Back to the phone call.. she starts telling me she doesn't think I'm trying hard enough to get myself better. I told her I have had a really rough time the past 2 years and it has been difficult.  Her reply was, 'everyone goes through rough times'. Needless to say that really hurt and upset me. I told her she doesn't know what it feels like, etc, that I know she doesn't understand,  etc....that when you're in that mode it's hard to reach out.  I don't see her that often, in part due to distance. I started writing her a letter reiterating some of the above plus stating she doesn't know the time I spent trying to find support groups (outside of seeing my therapist twice a week). Also said there were times I was ready to give up and had no energy to try to find more help.
Told her my letter to her was not done in anger but to help her see how I've been feeling. This is the first major argument we ever had and I know it won't end the friendship, but it has been truly upsetting.... Anyone else with a similar experience????
By the way, I have been feeling less depressed since before I was discharged and after meeting with my therapist Tuesday decided I would once again try TMS...

Possibly getting fired?,"I don't know if I am being fired. I received a letter via certified mail that the board decided not to renew my contract at the school district. I was not told by my principal that I was being fired. But I was told that people hired on an emergency basis are not renewed anyway by formality. The letter seems to indicate something else, though.  I was hired on sort an emergency basis after the schoolyear started because a teacher passed away. I was really grateful for the job because I had a hard time finding one.  I left my other job, where they wanted to hire me back, and I liked it-I liked the students and the work, but I quit because two of my colleagues were severe ragers and management would simply not get rid of them. The stress of dealing with them on a daily basis was killing me.  Listening to their screaming and ranting and being verbally attacked by them.  Plus a mental-health facility moved in next door and the screaming and banging on our walls was awful.
After three and a half years, I ended up leaving.  I didn't want to because there was a lot that I liked about the actual work and I felt I was a fit for it. I knew it would not be a good idea to go back into the regular school districts at a younger grade level, as I didn't feel it was a good fit for me.  But I HAD to have a job and one was offered to me. Sure enough, it's turned out to be awful. So far since October, a student brought a loaded gun to my class, another teacher was punched by a student and they did nothing about it, and people are going crazy in the lunchroom.  Teachers are not coming to work, and both the special ed teachers quit-one this fall and another just left, so they simply leave the kids in my classroom and unsurprisingly they go nuts, because they are special ed in my regular class. They just fill my seats but I'm not authorized to give them grades, so no accountabiltity.  In two of my classes, the kids scream and go crazy.  They are incredibly nasty to me. No matter what I do to help or discipline them, it makes no difference. If it weren't for one of the principals, and some helpful parents I would be screwed. One of my students who was expelled from another school for accosting females has started to try and grope me.  I feel disgusted, and paralyzed. 
I had to take off work for a medical apppointment today, and sure enough, the instructions I left for the sub were not good enough.  I left very detailed plans, and a stack of work on the desk for the sub. I also secured a sub five days ahead of time and let the office know the work was on the desk. Like clockwork, just as I predicted, I received a text this morning from our trainer: ""Did you leave plans?"" This an hour after the sub was supposed to check in, get the key, go to my room, and read my instructions.  I'm sure I will be reprimanded for ""not leaving plans"" when I come back, even though they are there in plain view.  At my old job taking a day off was not a major ordeal. They simply covered it and even found the sub themselves.  I feel paralyzed as nothing I do is right ever.  I was in trouble for arriving early to lunch to drop off the students. I thought being late was the real issue.  In addition, I spent five hours preparing for my evaluation.  The evaluation materials were given to me by our trainer (I didn't come up with any of the materials). I implemented HER lesson, and got a dismal review (although I didn't fail the review). The principal didn't even come, even though it was scheduled in advance, and they sent someone else to do it.  They claimed not to understand the materials I uploaded even though they supplied me with the materials. 
All this with fourteen years' experience in the field.  No matter what directions I give to the students, they yell back and argue. I even think it's dangerous. The letter states that the board voted for my non-renewal, but that I may apply to any other position I want.  I've never been fired before.  I've done every thing I possibly could to do the right thing and be conscientious, but it does nothing, save from me being fired immediately. I keep my nose clean, come on time, have good attendance, and teach the lessons.  It makes zero impact. Half the kids still fail because they hate what I'm teaching and refuse to turn anything in. Some of them are even violent to their parents.
Maybe the coronavirus will take us all out and I won't have to worry about this.
I do not want to be fired; however, in some way, I don't know if I see it as a negative in the large scheme of things. The woman who onboarded me has literally fifty-two years in the organization, and when she was punched by the student did this principal help her? No, they refused to call the police and it looks as though they may dismiss her, instead. Fifty-two years she gave to this place. She said she is going to quit.  Another teacher of longtime status and a pillar of the community is also being removed from her position due to strange allegations.  There was a major uproar in the lunchroom and tempers were flaring. 
Some students despise me and the knowledge I have to offer. Yet, I'm taking classes online and everything I teach is demanded in the coursework. I think they have no idea what they are in for.
I have no idea what I'm in for. I almost feel like I should have held onto my prior position. As bad as it was, I was really good at it and they wanted me back, and asked me to stay. But the co worker was murder.  What's next for me, I don't know. I'm pushing fifty. I don't know what my future looks like. I need my health insurance. ",depression
Nuisance,"I titled my post ""nuisance"" because that's what I feel like. 
I've been trying to look up positive and inspiring quotes to uplift my mood. I try to meditate. I was taking Zoloft prescribed to me by my doctor, but it made me extremely drowsy. My job requires me to drive patients to doctor's appointments, so I stopped taking the medication so I can drive safely. 

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be here anymore because I think I'm a bother to everyone. I think if I weren't alive anymore everyone will have a great life without me. I'm tired of being depressed. I want to be happy, and be a great mother, daughter, and friend. I also want to do anything I can to help others who struggle with anything. 

I just want relief.

Just venting,"I'm 29 and been depressed since I was a child. I've tried so many things but nothing worked and the reason why is because I didn't care for anything to work. I tried certain things like antidepressants because I wanted my family and friends to be happy that I was trying. All I ever wanted was death because that will give me forever peace. I usually sleep to escape life but now its doesn't work because I now have nightmares. I really wish suicide wasn't frowned upon. I wish they'd understand that I'm still here because of them but doing that means I'm living with pain and crying every single day. They also don't know I cut and burn myself all the time. I just wish I can finally do something that makes ME happy, but I know I Cant do that because people will be sad and disappointed. Sigh",depression
"My former ""life coach"" is in the news","As if this week couldn't be worse, I went to my support group this week and the woman who I used to coach with (I quit her and went to a real therapist with a degree) because I thought maybe she was freaking crazy and full of it.  She started doing this bizarre energy work on me that made no sense.  I mean I'm into spirituality to a fair exent and I do believe in energy and all that, but I started to think she was full of s*hit. I quit her.  I also stopped hanging out with one of her friends and here is the reason why:
My life coach's friend, who was an acquaintance of mine, had a tragedy this summer in which her brother committed suicide.  I felt badly for her, but noticed that my friend seemed oddly cold and not upset.  She also stated that her late brother had asked to be shot and killed.  This chilled my bones and I utterly stopped calling her. I was suspicious and terrified. She also became hostile with me. I have not yet removed her from facebook.
Now, I heard through rumor (and it is true because I found it on the news), that the former life coach is connected with two murders.  I will not state the case because if you heard it you would know-it's all over national headlines. We never heard from her again at the group, and she MARRIED a convicted murderer very quickly-he later died in her house.  Seems to me dead bodies follow these people and that there is a trail. The moment I heard about it I wanted to bolt from the group.  I looked up her name and indeed there she was-in connection with a convicted murderer whom it looks like she married to get him out of trouble.  It looks extremely suspicious.  I want to delete and block them both. Not only did she marry a murderer but he is now dead also; found dead in her house.  I'm scared, I mean I am really scared. ",depression
Big Breakup,"I don't know if this would be considered a big breakup as we weren't dating very long, but it sure feels like it.  I feel horrible today.  I was sobbing my brains out on Wednesday because my ""man"" was missing in action again.  It seems like Valentine's Day ruined this relationship. Things seemed to be going alright until Valentine's Day and then everything imploded.  He texted me on Valentine's to basically cancel. I didn't even know if I was being dumped on Valentine's Day. We salvaged the evening and everything seemed alright. He basically dropped a bomb on me.  He stated the problem was with that his business was failing and that he couldn't even make his car payment and could not afford to go out-the outing I suggested was twelve dollars a ticket. I thought this was a really affordable thing to do, and he was crying when I called him.  Because I really cared about him I was trying to work with him, so the following night I invited him to a free bookstore event per a friend's suggestion because I was also super worried about him based on him crying the following evening.  And I told him not to worry, that he dosen't need to pay for me on a regular basis. He told him I was the nicest and kindest woman he ever dated, that he loved my laugh.  I just wanted to make him happy, to ease his fears, let him know I cared about him, and try to preserve the relationship.
He then flaked out on seeing me for the plans HE made the following day, then he quit calling, and stopped coming over for our date night. I was here in a ball sobbing my brains out when he texted. He just wanted to sit and text on our date night, so I finally brought this up. After some conversation where he told me he really liked me and wanted to continue dating me, I asked him then why he kept avoiding me. He said he was avoiding me because he was humiliated about his failing business and money situation. But I thought he understood that I was being there for him-like he asked me to.  I was more or less stood up three times in a row and couldn't deal with it anymore.  I was crying, and I think he might have been too as this was over text; his divorce was finalized this week, however he told me he just was not ready to deepen the relationship and had no time to offer due to child custody  and working all the time to save his business.  I said if he couldn't even get together on the weeks he didn't have his son to forget it.  He started apologizing profusely. I told him I would send back the belongings he left here.  For not wanting to deepen this, he sure talked about ""love"" and ""relationship"" a lot when he talked about us. He came over here three times a week and we had long extended conversations-that he initiated. He then pulled out the rug from under me. I asked him ""why did you bother or even get started"".  I told him I thought I was being used also. For someone who doesn't want to deepen the relationship, he sure spent a hell of a lot of time and effort at the beginning.
I thought I felt better yesterday, but now the weekend (this weekend) where he would have been here, he is gone. The silence is deafening. I can't even focus or form much of a thought beyond typing this.  I feel destroyed.",depression

Struggling,"I'm struggling and I hate it. I hate this feeling that I'm holding myself back. I'm wanting to succeed in things and flourish and grow but I can't help but feel that I am holding myself back. Part of the reason isn't even my fault. My immune system isn't that great and I get sick a lot. I also have chronic migraines and I'll get one out of nowhere. Other days, my depression and anxiety will wash over me like a tidal wave and I drown in my own thoughts and feelings.
However, I think that part of me, a really insecure part of me, doesn't want to succeed. I'm scared of being successful and having people expect so much of me and then dissapointing everyone when I am unable to meet their expectations. I want to make others happy and meet their expectations but I have this feeling that I'm not good enough and will never meet anyone's expectations. I try so hard to tell myself that I don't need to meet everyone's expectations and that I am good enough but there is that small voice in my head that tells me otherwise. I hate that I am my own worst enemy.",depression
Something Good for a change,"Here goes. So at the tender young age of 39 I had my very first panic attack. The depression followed shortly. My life was turned into some kind of black hole. I haven’t been on here since August. Since then I started over. Quit my job, moved twice. Health problems etc. Thebfumny thing is I’m basically back in the same situation I was in back then. Same type of job same, went back to the same house. It’s funny cause last year I wanted out. I was pretty close to giving up. Yet here I am in the exact same management job, different company but same exact motions. I would never have thought I would have a smile on my face again. Yet here I am and I have that smile. Sure things get hectic and I have that cloud start to form overhead. The only thing that’s different now is I know I can do something else. It was a great fear that if I tried to start over, I wouldn’t have the strength left in me. I was stronger than I gave myself credit for. I’m not some special being. I’m just like everyone else. And if I can do it so can you. ",depression
"Kind words, thoughts, prayers, vibes","Hi. As I sit and go through my morning cry, I know things need to change.

My career is a disaster,"This is a rather predictable and crappy post, but I've been attempting to change careers for quite a while. My current career is a total disaster. I've been teaching for a long time; fifteen years, and have been trying to get out of it.  
I will work somewhere for a while and then the whole thing gets super toxic.  I left my last position due to relentless sexual harassment after three years, as did other  women; we left the company. I liked the job, the small venue, the work itself, but I could not deal with being ambushed on a daily basis by a crazy person whom they would not fire.
I thought I was into something better but of no avail.  The kids are going batsh** and they are totally uncontrolled. They are taking photos of me and putting them online without my consent. This is very hard to stop. One of them has a history of accosting women and girls and was expelled from his school-he's now here. Now, not only is he accosting females (I saw the write ups), he tried to get a handful of me. Um, no.  I already am in counseling and was sexually assaulted when I was in high school. No one would believe me and so he just nearly got away with it, and now he's a registered sex offender. I managed to get him off of me because I nearly beat his ass. I won't be violated by anyone. 
To make matters worse, one of the respected teachers who has worked there for over fifty years, and is now a retired sub, was assaulted by a student. The student attempted to punch her out.  When the teacher went to  block the punch, the principal pretty much did nothing and it's like they are putting it back on her. This woman trained me and spent her whole life and career in this place, and now this is what is happening?  If they can't be loyal to someone like that they are not going to help me.  As she was telling us about this at lunch yesterday, another colleague burst into the lunch room, kicked the door and hit it, and went totally off. She was furious because then another thing happened-the administration pulled a longtime teacher out of her fifteen year career in a position in the lower grades on some seemingly unfounded allegation. The fury and outrage in the lunchroom were really disturbing. Not to mention the trainer who came in that morning to ""guest teach a lesson,"" and turned the discussion to The Donald and policitcs and attempted to pull me in.  There were the misspelled words all over the board for this ""English lesson.""  As the talk of the president and his antics ensued, I felt my heart rate skyrocket so I walked out to calm myself down. Earlier this year, there was a debacle over a student who brought a loaded gun-into my classroom nonetheless. He is now gone but talk is this could have been prevented. 
This is too  freaking much. I will not be signing another contract here no matter how much money this pays, and it does pay alright.  I don't know what I will do next but I sure as hell know it won't be this.  I was pulled into the office and counseled because I seem, ""not very happy at times, and irritated, and that this is bad for customer service."" Granted this is true, but groping and putting pictures of me online does piss me off, so no denial there.  
Screw this sh*t.

Better?,"I haven't posted in this group for a long time...
That's something that I would have never thought that I would say.
A couple of months ago, I was in a really bad mental state where I wanted to end it all and just leave everything behind. (starting from a failed relationship and the passing of 2 very close family members). But I'm feeling better? I still think there are some things that I can work on and learning more about what my triggers are. I know now that my depression stems from my anxiety, and it just builds up from there. But I am in a new relationship where my partner likes me for who I am and helps me with what I am going through.
I am glad I found this site, and I am able to connect with you guys and hear what you guys are going through as well. I have made a few friends as well so then I have more people to talk to instead of being isolated.
I don't believe that my depression will be cured or ""gone for good"" But I believe that I can understand it better and learn different ways to cope instead of self-harm and staying in my rooms for days on end.

Would anyone even miss me if I was gone, maybe for like a week but then everyone would move on. This world is so messed up like I know I should go see a therapist but I cant afford that and no one would help me afford it. I feel very ignored. I feel very alone.

"Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, & Trichotillomania","Ive had an awful 30 minutes that's just made me come to this as I do not like discussing my feelings to people.

Before this my two month old cousin was murdered by his own mother whom is not blood related to me thank god. In between all of this  I've had lots of loss. Lots. Lately I had been feeling this very anxious awful feeling. It's like I'm waiting for the next person to die. For the next tragedy to arise. Mind you I had a good day and I was totally fine before now. I was just watching Greys Anatomy and an accident in the show triggered me for some reason. A couple months after my uncle died I started to pull my own hair out. I know that I shouldn't. I tell myself not to. It's like I have no control over it. It's like my brain controls my hands and doesn't let me think on my own. I don't know how else to think about it. Anyways, I'm struggling. I'm really struggling. I'm on an anti-depressant but it's for my sleep disorder called RBD. I really don't want to talk to my doctor about all this let alone a therapist but I really need some help.

Not happy with my life and where I am at.,"I don't think it is depression, I have been depressed and I know what that horror feels like (many times).  I recently turned 69 and I went into a major bout of introspection of my life, of where I am, and what my future holds (it is all downhill from here...I may have 20 years or I may only have one, who knows).  Looking back over my life I realize that all my life I have felt like I was on the outside of life looking in a window watching people having fun and enjoying life.  I never felt like I belonged anywhere, and to make matters worse I realize that I have spent my life beng afraid of taking chances.  I have let so many opportunities go by because I was to afraid to try. 
In looking at my life I see that I am nowhere near where I thought I would be at this stage of my life.  I look at guys the same age as me and they seem like what someone 69 (or older) should be like.  Me I feel like a 16 year old kid trapped in an aging body that hates me.  I guess I need to vent...  It is hard to express something you feel but can't put into words.

Just wondering tips,Hello all I am new to this online support group thing..I have tried numerous times to get a consistent therapist but it never seems to work for me so I decided maybe I could get help from peers just for advice and tips on things that you guys do to help with any day struggles with anxiety depression or loneliness. I take a few pills and when I first started taking them I felt on top of the world however as time has progressed I am at a stand still it gets frustrating because my psychiatrist wants to keep me on them(of course he is the professional) but I find myself at a point where everything seems to come crashing down and I can never pinpoint what the exact reason is? I'm just sad and feel empty like I have nothing to look forward to on a daily basis. I try to set small goals for myself mainly for working out because I do need to lose a few pounds and it goes well for a few days then back to square one.i don't have motivation and I see no need to In the moment but when it's said and done I feel like crap because I did nothing.

I have always been sensitive, but my weight is the most difficult topic for me to deal with mentally and emotionally. It has always been, and it's harder as I dwell on how I used to look and feel when I was 40 lbs less. His comments do not help me, and they even make me want to eat more. It's hard to explain. I am lost at what to do. The combination of his negative comments/ lack of emotional support and my weight gain are constantly making me feel depressed and alone. ",depression
Loneliness and Friends,"Chronically lonely and depressed and yet I thinkI am too selfish to be a friend to someone.  Or maybe that and too busy.  It's very frustrating.  I am taking care of my mom too and that is draining the shit out of me.  I'm so tired of my lonely dysfucntional life.  My work hours are 730 to 6 pm 5 days a week and then I'm doing chores and taking care of mom after work and on my days off, like today, i just want to and need to do nothing.  I can't even keep up with my friends on this site.  I am so angry with my mother right now.  God.  I'm in therapy which I can barely make time for but when i go my therapist even agrees that i'm basically screwed.  I can't afford to leave my job now and the situation with my mom is complex and I can't get her out of here very quickly.  I realize that I've been too much of a people pleaser in my life, not selfish enough in some ways, and that has contributed to what I am dealing with now.  Hindsight is 20 20 huh.  Well, I guess I just wanted to vent.  I actually am in a very dark place  and have been for a long time.  I have started to think or realize that life is just this way.  It doesn't work out that well for some people and we don't always have control over it and when that happens. well, this is what it feels like.  It feels very bad.  I'm going to get myself a cup of tea or coffe or something and watch videos.  Screw it.  Just wanted my little miserable voice to be heard by someone out there.  That means something.  Thanks.",depression
Too many things,Too much going on. I can handle a lot and now I may have to handle that I have cancer for the third time. Was I bad in another life and this is the punishment? Iv'e come though so so much and survived. Now I may be kicked in the dirt once again. Our bodies betray us at the most inconvenient time and there is no convenient time to see and feel yourself getting physically worse. There's no one to take the keys of your mind and drive you home safely. We all have to face that one alone. Sorry for the downer just going though it. ,depression

I miss the life I had,"2 1/2 years ago I moved from the apt I once had to a personal care home after my husband died on the advice of my social worker. How I wish I had stayed in my apt. It was a beautiful place. And I lost all my possessions and my car. I miss them so much, especially my cats. I had a cat all the years since 1979. They were all very special, always purring and greeting me at the door when I came home, playing with them. It was my own space, with privacy. Now in the personal care home, the administrator wants to give me a roommate. I don't want that. But I don't have a choice. I miss my own space and having a cat. I haven't been out to eat in a restaurant for over a year, mostly from lacking anybody to go with and transportation. My husband and I used to enjoy going out to eat and visiting state parks on weekends. I don't have a life anymore. I'm just existing and I feel so sad and empty. It doesn't seem like I'll have any of those things I miss so much ever again. Oh, what I wouldn't do to have my life back again. I miss my car, because then I could go to support group meetings and share with others and not feel so alone and lonely.",depression

My Depression Is Very Bad Today,Hi Everyone!My depression is very bad today because it has been almost a month now since my old Case Mgr Lisa accept a new job offer in a different department. So since she said yes they assign to this new lady name Taylor. The biggest problem that I am having right now while Lisa was working with me helping me for the pass 4 years I got really attached to her. I consider her to me a friend instead of my Case Mgr. So now I am having the hardest time letting her go and giving my new Case Mgr a chance to help me. They told Lisa a few weeks ago to block my cellphone number on her work phone. So I can't call her but I did download all these apps to my phone that gives you a second number so you can call somebody who has blocked you. So I have been doing that. Today I called her from a different number she had no idea it was me so she answer her phone. She told me that she couldn't talk because she had a client in her office then I asked her then can you call me back after you are done working with your client? She said Trisha you know I am not allow to call you back. I was like why Lisa then she said Trisha I really can't talk about that right now then she hung up the phone. Then I just sat on my sofa just crying my eyes out. Does anybody have any hints or any good advice that could help me to let go of Lisa before I end up getting myself into huge trouble? I am about to cry right now. All these bad ideas are going through my head right now that Lisa hates me so bad that is why she accepted the job offer so she could get away from me.,depression
TMS,"I was wondering if anyone else has tried TMS and what their experiences with it were, or are if in the middle of treatment.  My therapist recommended it to me and first I did some research on it,  even watched some YouTube videos on it. I have a long med history and basically have become treatment resistant to them, as well as just resistant and will not try another one! Monday I had my psych eval for it at the center and will be starting treatment on the 27th. I have reservations about it. First, It's a big commitment, 5x/wk for 4-6weeks. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and there are days I can hardly do anything. They said it's ok to miss a treatment here and there but not more than that. Second, it doesn't work for everyone and if this doesn't work I am out of options, except maybe one.... I can't live like this anymore . I've been so depressed for so long...
Please let me know your experiences with it,  how long until you noticed a difference and how you're going now. 
Thank you,
Bethelbee

At Night,"When the day becomes night and everything is quiet, I become lost in my own thoughts. The world becomes so big and I become so small. I just want to crawl into a hole and die. I feel more low and lost. I am drowning and there is no way out. I am trapped and I can't breathe. I am so extremely tired, sleep isn't enough. maybe if I could hibernate. The medication isn't doing anything, It just makes me numb. I try to be positive, I try to distract myself. but it's not enough. I think I get 8 hours of sleep but its never enough. day and night I'm tired. tired of life... I just do the same things over and over and you're telling me this is just the beginning??? I'm 20 years old my life has just begun but I feel ready to be done already. Perhaps this is my punishment. perhaps I deserve to feel this emptiness and always more intense at night. during the day I can handle it to a point but at night it consumes me completely.

Help,"I dont even know what to say, I haven't eaten in 3 days, I feel weak but I'm not hungry. I miss him so much, it's been 3 days since I last talked to him. He said he loves me and cares for me but he cant support me emotionally from his depression. I also heard from a friend that it was because our ""different future views"" and by that it was because I suggested moving into my place instead of his place like he suggested,  because it's cheaper. Like we didnt even have a full blown discussion about it, it was some drunken conversation on new years night. I wrote him a letter cuz if this was a rash decision, he wouldnt be the first one to reach out. So I put in the letter to message me if there was any part of him that loved me and wanted to be with me if he was just scared. I thought about mailing it in 5 days, thatd put it at his house almost a week and a half after the break up. Is that too soon? I just I feel like if we both love each other why cant we be together? Or am I just the last thought in his mind. I dont know, I miss him so much.",depression
I'm over life,"I dont even really know what to say. It was late, like 1 a.m the first time he said I love you. I hesitate. But I say it back. He asks me why I hesitated. I say because its gonna hurt so much when you leave. He tells me so sweetly that he isnt going anywhere. Fast forward. I'm on the phone with him asking him if theres anything I can do to change his mind on leaving. He says no he needs to go get help for his mental health and he cant give me the support I need. He needs to work on himself. He tells me he loves me and cares for me so much and he wants me to take care of myself. He cant go thru this knowing I'm not ok. And I am NOT ok. He says maybe when he has worked on himself, who knows where we will be and maybe we will find each other again. I break down not wanting to get off the phone as he tells me goodbye. Part of me understands the mental health. It's coming up on the anniversary of when I almost took my life. But the other part of me is so deeply in love with him and am so saddened that he wont be in my life. No more weekends together, nor more inside jokes, no more late night cuddles and no more I love yous. I am so deeply worried about him and i am so saddened by the fact that we are not a we anymore. How do I carry on when I miss him so much and know hes in pain and cant do anything. How do I wake tomorrow knowing exactly at 1030 he would be waking up and I would be texting him ""morning handsome "" I thought my pain was over. I thought we were happy and my search was over. We talked about moving in together, and the things we would buy. We talked about vacations we would take and the plans we had for the future. Do I hang on to the hope that we will get back together? A month? 2 months? How long? Do I message him a month from now asking how he is doing or will I be opening myself to getting shut out again. I really thought he was it. He brought so much joy and laughter back into my life. His smell could spark something in me, his touch lit the fire. His voice, oh his voice, could send me to the moon. And now that's just gone. How do I do this when I am so deeply in love with him and I cant be with him.",depression

Numb,"I self harmed. It's been 4 years since my last self harm. I feel so broken and I just needed to visualize my pain. I feel stupid, this was all over a boy. A stupid boy who says his depression is too much and he cant give me the emotional support I need and he needs to go get help. That maybe one day we could see where we are at in life. Ironic isnt it. He leaves me because hes depressed so what do I do, harm myself. I was so happy, the happiest I have been in a long time. Every moment with him I felt safe and loved. Where did it go so wrong? I decided to write him a letter, a letter about everything and asking him if there is any chance of us again. Hes not good at expressing his emotions and I just know if theres a chance, he wouldnt initiate it. The thing is , I dated the letter for one month from now. This is still a fresh wound and I want him to experience life without me, maybe just maybe, he will miss me and I might get a message or he might realize he made a mistake. If one month from now I still feel the way I do, I'm going to mail it to him. I am struggling tho. This is the 1st day of not talking to him and I miss him so much. How do I just forget someone who came in and made such a big impact in my life. I love him so much it hurts. I just want to stop hurting, I want the pain to stop.",depression

is every day just going to keep getting worse?,"This is just the latest in the if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any luck at all. So last Friday Dr said that hubby's wrist won't be healed until end April.  He's hoping. That mean 16wks without work/income etc.  Then on Monday I ended up having a fight with daughter as she only calls me when she wants money. I said it would be nice if she could call/text or something just to say hi how are you occasionally. But well.........she wrote me a long letter that will hurt me.........so she isn't sending it until things calm down a littel. Then on Tuesday went to buy a carton of cigarettes and found out the government made the kind I smoke illegal.  Well I can just hear everyone say now you have a good excuse to quit.  Well guess what I have lost my income my job my way of life and in essence my husband been home for a month and have seen my granddaughter once....so pretty much my smoking is all that is keeping me going between  the insanity of WCB, the horribleness of the insurance companies that want the 2019 filed taxes before they pay us what we are supposed to be entitled too.........you can't even file your taxes til the end of Feb! I was so proud of myself in order to save money I had cut myself down to 8 cigarettes a day - sometimes 6 if I stayed real busy. 
Any way........it nearly pushed me over the edge. Since when I smoke short cigarettes I get headaches and dizziness and nausea and I feel really out of it. I don't have any desire to quit.  NONE. Then on Monday and Tues I was trying to get the T4's done and the acounting up to date...but between having to be cheif cook and bottle washer and having pretty much no help and having to help my mom with her resume and give my kid money for her rent and listen to my mom say over and over I don't want a job - you don't have an idea how hard it is for me not to work. You are not being nice enough to me. And trying to give hubby breakfast lunch and dinner and vitamins and water and me trying not to break down and give up.  
Then on Wed hubby woke up with a horrible rash, increibly. He thought it might be shingles..Dr said no its an allergic reaction to anti imflamatories maybe. So now he isn't taking anything....not anything that is good for him in case it was the vitamins or something that made him ill. ANd we went and spent $50 on bottled water in case its from the water here. It was just one more thing and all I want to do is sit and cry and cry and cry or I feel like breaking something.
I was trying to be ok. I was trying to concentrate on what I could control and what I could accomplish but really when every single day there is some kind of crisis. When I am ""alone"" every single day no one to talk to who cares. No one to vent too in real life I mean. But everyone wants something from me. If I don't do it in a perfectly gently voice, and I don't smile at them, or I don't act the way they want me too........well  I am just a horrible evil thing. How dare I even exsist. 
My going outside once an hr to sit in peace and quiet with no one to nag me belittle me annoy me is my only outlet.  I feel like everything that I love and care about everything that makes me happy is just being taken away one after another daily and I need it too stop. Or I am afraid I am going to stop exsisting. ",depression

Not ok,"Grief, it's a 5 letter word, I feel like the pain that I am feeling in my heart right now should be more than 5 letters. 

Its 830 in the morning and I have not been to sleep yet. I was okay until 5 minutes ago, then watching Homicide hunter on the tv made me think of you and how much you loved watching ID channel. 

Now I am not okay. My hands are shaking, the tears are rolling down my face. I miss you so much it hurts my soul. I was lucky, I got to know you, got to love you, was helped raised by you. I had you in my life for 28 years, you taught me so much. You made me strong and let me know that you were always there for me, told me that I could call you no matter what and tell you anything and you would still love me and be there for me and help me get through anything. I was the lucky one. I was nans girl. I miss you. I'm thinking of you and because I am thinking of you I am also thinking of Pa. 

Pa was the first man I fell in love with, the first man I felt loved by. I was his road dawg, he loved me for me, he got me my first tattoo, and helped teach me how to drive. He took me on dates and he made time for me. He taught me how to drink & make a killer homemade pizza. He never made me feel unloved, or made me feel like he was disappointed in me. 

They were my rock. They loved me and I loved them so much. I hate that my children will never feel their love or get to know what amazing people they were, they will just know them through me, through my memories and that isnt enough but it has to be.

Death Be Not Proud,"TW: Suicide and Suicidal Ideation
""Death be not proud, though some have called theeMighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so""
The first two lines of this poem resonate with me today. Death has become a part of my life. I just moved to a new city, and am in the process of finding a new care team (Therapist, doctor, psychiatrist). My biggest health problem right now is about every 6 months I try to kill myself or seriously self harm. The line between those two are blurred. I am stable right now, if a little weighed down by my emotions, but with all these new health interviews I'm repeatedly rehearsing and reciting my history of dances with death. I just finished graduate school, where I was hospitalized every semester for 5 semesters. At the time I was doing what had to be done to get through grad school, finish and get out. I guess I'm proud that I stuck with it and it didn't kill me, but It left me with a mental health track sheet that I'm not proud of. 5-6 times in 3 years, the last and most serious one was only 2 months ago. 
It's not even worth pretending that the whispers of death don't sit on my shoulder every day like an annoying neighbor who invited himself in. I live with death. It feels very lonely. I don't know anyone else who simply has to put up with it every day. If I tell anyone about it they either dismiss it or they jump to serious concern and protective measures. It's always good to be safe, but I don't know who to talk to about this. Not my friends and family, it will only upset them or hurt me further.  Death is rotten company, but for now, he has no power over me.",depression

"Oh, the dysphoria!","My doctor and I recently determined that I likely suffer from Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, so my normal anxiety and depression is intensely exacberated once a month. I don't see a support group here for PMDD, so I am just going to vent here to you Depression people. Here goes. 
Baseline, I feel that I deal with normal anxiety and depression like every other person and maintain an irritable, cranky disposition, which for the most part is eased by 10 mg lexapro and .5 mg lorezepem for tougher situations.Here's what the dysphoric phase looks like for me:
I have a bad cold and I am at my boyfriend's house and he is taking care of me. ""Hey babe, do you need anything?""
""No thank you baby."" 
""Do you want some water?""
BAM. There it is. Irritation, agitation strikes me in my gut, shoots through my body, zings up the back of my neck, I can almost feel my eyes turn dark. ENOUGH WITH THE QUESTIONS. I SAID NO I DON'T NEED ANYTHING. DOESN'T WATER FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF ANYTHING?! !@#$ No, I didn't say that out loud. I took a deep breath and pleaded with myself to please not be a dick to your loving, doting, caring boyfriend who is trying to take care of you. ""No thank you."" 
He keeps going though. Because he is a sweetheart. Because he wants to make sure I am sure that I don't need anything. Maybe because he thinks I don't want to put him out, so I just say that I don't need anything, but surely I need something. THIS IS ENDEARING PEOPLE. Annoying, and maybe a little irritating even to the people who are not baseline irritable, BUT ENDEARING. Even on my good days, and he does crap like this, I get annoyed, but I feel the love and I feel the endearment towards him deep down under all my agitation. Sometimes, I can pull back that layer of agitation, I feel my soul soften, and I cock my head to the side and look into his eyes and smile gently and say, ""you are so sweet. Now please shut up.""  
""How about a blanket?"" Now I am even more angry because you know why? I REALIZE I WANT A BLANKET. I take another deep breath and try to say ""yes, please"" sweetly and gratefully. It didn't work. I sounded like an asshole. (Actually I think what I said was ""JESUS yes just gimme the blanket goddamnit). 
Now he's annoyed with me. And he should be. 
Now comes the worst part of the dysphoria. The crying. I sit there, under my blanket, he's not talking to me anymore. Who can blame him. So now I'm alone wtih my thoughts: What the F is my problem. I am such an A-hole. I've made him feel bad. I've made him feel like he can do nothing right. I've made him feel inadequate. I don't deserve him. I don't deserve happiness. I am pathetic. I am awful. I am selfish, I am childish, I am imature. Who could love me. Why does he love me. 
I don't feel worthy to be even sitting next to him. I don't deserve the comfort of the blanket. I get up and go to the bathroom and sit on the cold floor and sob and sob and sob and tell myself the same negative things over and over and over again. I even chide myself over the drama of sitting on a cold bathroom floor alone. (Like what is that about? Cry in bed for the love! I think when there is so much emotional pain and you don't know what to do with it, it hurts even more to be physically comfortable. So I feel like i have to make myself physically uncomfortable on a cold, hard bathroom floor. So. Dramatic.) 
I want him to follow me to the bathroom, sit on the floor with me, put his arms around me, rock me back and forth, kiss my forehead, and just say, ""it's okay, i love you, it's okay, this will be over soon."" I also DON'T want him to do that. I don't want him to see me, indulging in my pathetic dramatic ritual, reverting to this odd, child-like behavior, seeking attention but then not accepting it. 
Eventually, I'll stop crying and go to sleep. But the next day my eyes are nearly swollen shut. They hurt. My soul hurts. I'm embarrased. I can't look him in the eye.  I will weep off and on all day - everytime I feel the pain in my eyes, or everytime I look in the mirror and see how puffy they are, or every time I try to think about taking a deep breath and pulling myself together and try to bounce back, I recoil even further and will start sobbing hysterically. 
And this will go on until my period starts. I swear, you've never seen a woman so happy to start bleeding! 
My doctor started me on Yaz (birth control) to help with the PMDD. This is my second month on it. I seem to remember the first month going really well - I didn't have any severe dysphoric episodes. This month was different, and almost worse. I suppose I should give it another month. 

Thanks for reading.

Dating sucks,"So me and this guy have been together about 5 months and everything has been going good. We've had one ""fight"" but other than that we get along great, he says he loves me and we have a blast when we are together. We were messaging tonight and I was getting tired so I said ""cant wait to see you tomorrow I love you night"" and he said it back. Then 2 hours later, whilevim asleep i get a message saying he wants to break up and we dont have things in common and all this and that. He changed his facebook to single. So I go to his house and wake him up. I know that seems crazy but I was so distraught and confused. After a lil bit of yelling and a few ""get out of my house"" we calmed down and started to talk and He said it just seems like all we ever do is watch what show I want or listen to what music I want, and we dont have the same likes anymore. I told him I could give 2 shits what we watch and we could watch porn for all I care and that he just has to talk to me about these kinds of things. He kept apologizing and I asked him is there any part of me that wants to work this out and he said yes and grabs my face and kisses me. We embrace in a hug and he says he was sorry over and over and that this is his first relationship in a long time and he didnt know how to handle it and he said I said I love you when you went to bed cuz I meant it. I asked him numerous times if we were ok and he kept saying yes. His dog started to act up so I left and he said he would see me later. I got home and obviously threw up from all the anxiety. I'm still worked up and numerous thoughts are going through my head like ""am I going to get another text while I'm at work"" ""does he really love me"" I just am so confused, I mean I left his house and he said all those things and I feel like he meant it, my depression is just trying to tell me something different.  Or is it? I dont know, I need some help.",depression
Very depressed and lonely,"I am very depressed and lonely and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I was married for 25 years, the last ten of which I was separated from my husband and had my own apartment. Two years ago my husband died, I lost my apartment and went on Social Security Disability, and lost all my possessions and my car. Now I'm stuck in a personal care home with 17 other people, none of whom I feel close to and rarely talk to. This isn't my hometown--it seems like most of them are locals. I have no family or friends. I would love a therapy group but there are none. I have a caseworker who is no help at all. I requested another caseworker and was told that wasn't possible. I have a therapist who can't seem to schedule me for appointments very often. Mostly I read books to pass the time. I long for some face to face conversation with people and to be able to talk about my depression and anxiety with people who understand. I make too much money on SSD to qualify for peer support. I miss my hometown which is 200 miles away.  I haven't been out of this house in almost a year. It seems like there are no options for me at this point. I miss having control over my life and having support group meetings to go to. Transportation is a problem--I have none. I have yet to find a church where I feel like I fit in. I need some kind of group but it seems like there are none where I live. I feel like I have no life, I just exist in a state of emptiness. In the past year I had all my upper teeth extracted and can't even eat normal food. I have to have another oral surgery procedure in January before I can get a denture, and that's if I can afford one. I pay $1000 a month to live where I am and it's not worth it. I just feel hopeless in my current circumstances and I can't see a way for things to get any better. If I just had one person to be an ally, that would help, but I don't. I hope this group can somehow give me some direction.

"One Step Forward, 10 Steps Back","I really am struggling to understand why it's so difficult.
I have a good few days - seem to be making progress in myself and keeping my emotions under control. 
The smallest thing happens...
CRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The whole world seems to collapse around me and I'm back to where I was before. If not worse...
I'm currently trying to listen to uplifting music and finding it difficult to concentrate on anything. Even typing this post has taken nearly three hours as I keep feeling like 'what's the point?'
Does anyone else feel this way and, if so, do you have any tips on how to keep motivated rather than spiralling back down to where you were before?

Life after divorce,Hi everyone I have been divorced for about a year now I was married for 10 years still struggling with just letting things go it was all I knew for so long and I try to get by with the denial and dating but honestly I'm still not okay and I don't know if I ever will be okay I really feel like I lost a piece of me not necessarily from losing her but my family being split up we do have two kids I haven't been the same since the split and have been suffering from depression and loneliness even when people are around me I don't know what to do anymore it's kind of like I just feel like I'm existing instead of living now.,depression
WOnder,"I often ask myself what is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with me? What is wrong with the women on the outside? What is wrong with the women on the inside? And in any given situation I would turn to a loved one and ask because I wanted reassurance. And now I dont know who I can turn to and turst to ask the question I so desperately seek the answer to. I know of course writing to you guys and asking you all that same question will not validate what I seek but maybe in asking I can get people who understand and know how I feel when asking these question. And its not just in the outside world, and by that I mean friends work school, but its also within my own home to where I don't feel safe and it leads me to having thoughts. Thoughts that i'd like not to have. But I just dont get it what is it about me. Is it because of my apperance the color of my skin or my body type? Is it my hair? Is it the way that I speak? Or maybe it is the way that I walk? I just want it all to stop. Time. Space. Life. But that wouldn't solve my problems or the way that I feel... Id just like to know what it is. What is it? why is it? Darkness all around me. Consuming my soul and tranforming my face into a person I don't even recongize. I cry out and plea for saving but silence is all I hear. Nothing but silence. And I sink deeper and deeper and continuing to let the darkness consume until there is nothing left. Sitting remains a body that was once light and now dark and empty. Soulessly dirfting. All I want is to breath lightly walking across the smooth sand beneath me with no worry, no question as to why or what is wrong with the person I am. To be accepted rather than rejected and discriminated against because of color of my skin, the langauge that I speak, the personality that have, the way that I walk or the gender that posses. Accept me the way that god  sees me as. ",depression
Rejection and Acception,"I can speak for all but I know for me that when I am attempting to express how I feel to people that most of the time I feel rejected because I can tell that they aren't listening. And that has been something that has gone on majority of my life. I was the black sheep and unwelcomed and not wanted. For a long time that hurt, it hurt not just to hear it, that my feelings werent cared about, but also by the way people would look or the body posture that they would give of that they dont give a rats ass. I often wonder why it is I get rejected and honestly I dont have all the answers but one thing that i am sure of is that i dont need no ones opinion",depression

I’m tired of my mind telling me to shut up. Im tired of my mind telling me the world and people are better off without me. I’m tired of my mind beating me up 24/7.

I want to give up,"I am not even sure why I am posting. Its been 2 wks now and I have been trying to keep my head above water.  I didn't want to fall into a stupid depression or allow my negativity to take over. I made a to do list, I thought of how I could control me if not what is going on around me. I tried to focus and not get panicked.  I used all the stupid skills I am supposed to use when things fall apart around me.
But each day it just gets worse. Oh it is just little things granted........stupid doctor's, -40* weather, frozen up truck, broken toe (yeah that's what happens when you drop a frozen ham on it. Overtired, worn out, sick  of fighting, referral appts not booked, snow.........like I said small things. But small things yeah well after a huge crisis.................well that is what wear's you down. 
Guess I should start at the beginning...on the 7th hubby fell off the trailer and broke his wrist. I would say thank god it happened at work and he can claim WCB, but thanks to a Dr marking the wrong boxes on the form its going to be a fight....Not to mention the fact that for the first time in over a decade, we were actually making good money, there was actually savings in the bank. I was actually feeling hopefull and making plans for the future. 
So in the last 2 wks I have lost my job my income my security, in essence my husband.....it is a bad break and he is in  a lot of pain. So all I do is take care of him and try to deal with my mom and her depression, worried about daughter and granddaughter as daughter's husband got laid off the week before CHristmas -- I wasn't too worried he was sort of scheduled to go back 1st or 2nd wk in Jan, and we were ,making good money it wasn't like we couldn't have helped them. Of course trying to deal with all of this while trying to deal with my SAD is not helping either.
Yep the story of my life...............""cheer up it could be worse""  ""I cheered up it got so much worse!""So now I just want to end it.......so sick of trying so sick of trying. I can't keep my head above water. I just can't. It's too much all of it is too much. Oh and to put the cherry on top of it....3 days after hubby fell, I got a panicked message from my cousin saying that my brother was in the hospital and only had 3 days to live could I get a hold of his son (who he hasn't spoken too or cared about in years)
So then 3 days of family drama insued. I have to fight off my co dependant tendencise. It brough up a bunch of stuff on addicts and childhood and all the guilt and pain etc etc etc. 
There is only so much I can take........I don't want to take anymore. No more worry or fear or pain or loss or wondering or any of it. I want a normal decent life...........no BS.....I am sick of the rug being ripped out from under me. ",depression
I went from up to unfunctionally down.help pls,Maybe I should be posting in the bipolar group but it seems here is where all the help is. All I have to do is get in a conversation with someone that so much spills out that I'm left with humiliation & extreme social anxiety. I berate myself all day & overimagine the fallout. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just weird & when I have the opportunity to start over with a new environment I screw it up. My therapist whom I adored went on maternity leave & as soon as she was about to come back I lost her due to a health insurance change. There's so much I want to tell her & now I will never get the chance. I cannot find a new therapist & ive been too long without one. I don't particularly want to begin my story over again with someone new either. I went back to my husband after divorcing him bc he vowed to protect & help me & he's just not. I don't feel as tho I can face tomorrow. I can't believe the garbage that falls out of my mouth. I hate hate hate myself. I found something I loved to do & I cannot go back bc I'm now back to being a freak. I have no friends. I never will. ,depression

I'm 27 and I feel like my life has been taken from me. I don't want to live in pain every day but I dont want to kill myself because besides being in pain 24/7 I have great family and love. I just dont want to livd like this. Medication at my age is just not an option for me. I want to have kids and not have my liver or kidneys fail because of the drugs. I also don't want to build a tolerance so when I'm 60 and can't get out of bed I can depend on drugs. I'm just tired of every part of my body giving up on me.

So depressed with my life and living it!!!,"At one time I was so happy and Over the hills in my marriage. Overtime I fell apart. Now I don't even know who I am. So for the last year my husband and I have have hit the lowest ever. I am an opiate addict, he's a speed addict. Any way so I recently found that he's been talking to some woman for over a year. Telling her he loved her, told her I left my kids with out fighting because I'm a drug addict or a whore. I can't even remember which one it was it was such a blur. Any way, I started using because I was so depressed he never wanted to touch me or spend any time with me. Over the year I literally asked me 300 times if he was talking to someone. He lied to my face then accuse me lying to him all the time. Even when I told the truth I was a liar. I got too the point where I didn't care anymore. I was just getting high to numb the pain of my life. So one night he's sleeping and I look at his phone to find he's been talking to some girl. The messages said from her I love you and he responded with I love you too baby. Mind you he was setting next to me when he sent this. So I find out he was playing this game and talking to her for a year. That he literally told her all these personal things about our life. Everything but me, he left me out. And made himself out to be this amazing person. Which is crazy, considering it's not true. Anyway not the point. So a few weeks ago my world comes crashing down, he beats me up when I find out. He's all strung out and beats the living shit out me. Because I was crying freaking out. So I leave the state get clean, and come back home. He's now doing really good. But I'm not okay. He doesn't consider that he's cheated at all. He doesn't think it was cheating. But he totally left me on this roller coaster alone. Now I'm not okay, even though he's acting like I'm his world and he's so sorry for what happens to us. I just can't get past it. I'm clinically depressed, my aniexty is so bad, I'm pretty sure I'm bipolar. One minute I'm fine the next I'm loosing it. I cry all day everyday, I feel like I lost everything like I adored this person who I thought felt the same. Maybe we're just both sick in the head idk. Anyway he's been really patient and kind. He has really made an effort to save us. Since I came back. And idk if I can be saved let alone save us. I thought about moving out having my own space would be best. But idk if I wanna do that. And FYI on this roller coaster my kids have been with family. Just so you don't think I'm allowing my  kids to endure this. I've never felt so lost in my life. I have considered things and thoughts I wish I didn't think about. I love him so much, I feel like I'm just plain crazy for having these feelings. I'm not the type of person that believes in divorce. I just don't, those vows I meant every word and I just personally think it's wrong. The easy way out, but idk if we're good for each other. Idk if I'll ever get past this, I have no idea what he said to this woman. According to him he told her he was married and trying to save his marriage. Idk. Idk if I believe him, I don't know if I ever will. Trust is not something that comes easy. The most insane part is we're so sexually in sink with each other it's unreal. Like we get into a fight and we make up with sex. Its not healthy. I pray everyday that things will get back to the point of trust and love again like it use too. I loved him. I really did and I still do. Just not the same as I use too. My depression is overwhelming and the thoughts inside my head are not good. Do you think it will get better? Or should I seek mental help?? I'm freakin loosing it. ",depression
Story about overcoming,"The star of Sunday's NFL championship game talked about how many teams rejected him and how he persisted, to set a championship record. “I actually still have the cut dates.

Not even — not everybody can deal with that type of stress and pain and agony that I went through.” Signed by the Eagles in 2015 as an undrafted free agent from Purdue, he was cut and added to their practice squad. Then signed by the Dolphins in and cut. Then claimed by the Ravens and cut. Then claimed by the Browns to finish a whirlwind season. He was released the day after final cuts by the Browns the following year, and had stints with the Bears and Jets before landing on the 49ers practice squad.  was with the Browns. My wife, she’s from Cleveland. So, we thought that we had something in the bag, me making the roster. And then coming into training camp, preseason, had a little bit of an injury so I missed the last preseason game that year. And I thought I was on the roster. I made the roster, the 53-man roster.

Change,"It's the driving force behind our development... without it, life would shrivel and rot away inside and out. It's a vital part of life and death. And yet, it is so, so very hard for me to deal with. I just got a better-paying, closer job and I am having trouble adjusting. The training is very thorough and intense, and it needs to be. I totally get that. But I am still adjusting. And I'm still adjusting to Denver. I've started to wonder if I'll ever adjust, as it's really not my scene. Too overdeveloped, too yuppified, too overcrowded with hipsters and rich 420-ers. I've decided that within the next five years (certainly no later), I will find a new place to live. Maybe somewhere on the Western slope. I keep thinking back to a few years ago when I lived in Fort Collins-- everything seemed better than it is today, although ""seemed"" is definitely the operative word there, because things definitely weren't. I guess depression distorts hindsight. I just get very frustrated with myself-- why is it so hard for me to adjust to change??? Seriously, it's not normal. ",depression

Hard on myself at work,"I've been a nurse at my hospital for over 2 years now, with the last 2-3 months being at a different unit. Honestly, I dread going to work because I feel like everytime I go, I make a fool of myself.

I always feel like I'm missing something, or didn't use critical thinking well enough. I didn't put any patient in harm's way, nor did a patient's status decline because of someting I missed. I once had a near miss when I almost gave insulin to a patient who's NPO (nothing to eat/drink). The nurse caught it before I gave it, but she said it in a way that made me feel stupid, ""He's NPO, why are you giving insulin?"" I wouldn't have mind if she said it in a nicer way like, ""It may not be a good idea to give it because he's NPO."" Honestly, I don't think this nurse likes me or thinks highly of me, and we're about the same age.

I also don't feel like one of the leads thinks highly of me. Whenever she's lead, I always mess up in some shape or form and she sees it, again they're minor hiccups. Once I wasn't sure if it was safe to give a BP med because HR was low, and I paged the doctor asking for parameters, and she told me to look it up instead of asking the doctor again (who didn't answer my page).

Now I have to face her tomorrow when I go to work and ask her if she can change my schedule; I just joined of Shared Governance (attended 1 meeting so far), and I forgot to put the next meeting on my schedule, and I'm kicking myself because it's something I should know by now.

I want to love my job, I love nursing, it's just that with every hiccup I make I get more and more depressed. What do I do?",depression
So much thoughts..,"I've tried to collect my thoughts on this so many times but its either turned into me crying my eyes out or just deleting it because I cannot form words.. I just need to talk to someone..

Anyways what I was told was that we have to move out of where we are.. we are a daycare in a old church and have been in there a very long time, but it was bought by this company two years ago who does food programs ect.. anyways we have till January of next year to find somewhere else, it may seem like a long time but in reality it doesnt.. if we dont find a place, we will have to close and I will have to find somewhere else to work.. just thinking about that scares me..  I've been here for three years, and connected with so many of the children and the people I work with.. they know i have anxiety and such, and have been really understanding of that.. when I was being told this I didnt really know how to process everything, I just took it all in.. after I was told this I came home and last night I cried myself to sleep and all day today I've cried.. I'm scared, my anxiety is high and my emotions are all over the place.. I've been an emotional wreck.. if we don't find anything by sept, we will have to let the parents know what is going on..

Ive always felt weird having a famly name that is not my mothers maiden name. I dont want to use my fathers name as he has never achknowledged me. I just dont know what too, my last name and middle name are an adaptation of a celtic name, when said together they sound similar. I had considered using these 2 names as its as close to the female celtic name (which is why she didnt use it) as possibe and doesnt change my first name. The issue is I would then have a last name which is first name, although I have seen this before, even with celebrities.If not that, how do I choose a last name? ",depression
Trapped in Ohio. . .sorry for so long rant.,"I'm not even sure where to begin. This has been building up for years. 
For the last two and a half years I have been up and down with my depression. For the most part, I have been pretty stable in just an overall feeling of discontent, but I go through phases of very deep depression and then back up to general discontent. Here the last few months, I have been in a state of (inn my opinion) mild-ish depression, then I dip to the feeling of ""I just want to stay in bed and cry"" multiple times a week. For a few days I feel like I am feeling a little better—maybe even motivated, then other days I just wake up feeling so low. Below, I will explain the situations that I know are causing these feelings. 
In the summer of 2017, my husband and I made the choice to rent a tiny house off of my boss who owns a small business. She always seemed trustworthy and seemed fair with her other tenants, so I trusted her despite vowing to never rent off private landlords due to having been burned in the past. She bought a very rough house in a bad location of town and ten feet from what looked like a little abandoned shed. This shed was completely trashed, felons and junkies lived in it and eventually on the porch and front yard when the city condemned it. This caused us problems throughout the two years we were there. 
At the time, I was finishing the last two and a half years of college where I double majored and my husband worked (currently still works) 60+ hours a week as a route manager for Coca Cola. Shortly after moving into this house--which I was very apprehensive about--I started becoming frustrated. After three months the landlord never finished fixing it before when had to be out of the last apartment. That wouldn't have been a big deal had the problems been fixed at any time during our renting, but also the house was severely shifted to the point a gap a foot or so long on the flooring under the trim was open straight to the ground which slugs, spiders, and pests--not to mention heating cooling issues--where coming in. Okay, okay, this post isn't about the house, but the short story was my frustrations over a slumlord and bad housing situation became depression after a couple other incidents happened. 
The landlord allowed us to have pets—she knew we were responsible and clean. We already had a dog and a cat but rescued a tiny kitten which I feel in love with. Just a few days after we rescued him, I came home after leaving for the grocery no more than 15 minutes—after kissing him all over his cute fuzzy face—to find him twisted on the floor bleeding from his eyes, nose and mouth. I screamed and called my husband and—of all people—my landlord because I didn’t know what to do. My landlord had several cats and said she never seen anything like it. We rushed him to a 24/7 vet hospital and had to put him down. The vet had no idea what could have happened other than it looked like a head injury. A few weeks later—in response to our grieving—we rescued two more kittens. They were Bengal mixed kitties, very intelligent and the one I fell head over heels with. He died exactly a year later to lymphoma. Within three weeks of his diagnoses, we spent $1,200 (which we barely had and this caused us added financial struggles for a while) to try to save him and then try to just make him comfortable. This was VERY hard on me especially having lost the first kitten only a year before to another traumatic-unexplainable incident. It was after this, that I dipped into a major low depression for the first time in a few years. Losing my second kitten happened only a couple months after my husband had a major surgery. . .
In the course of one year exactly, my husband went through two major emergency surgeries. One was two procedures to remove his gallbladder which almost killed him, and the second less then a year later for his appendix. This caused him to go into not only depression and severe anxiety but was combined with his very stressful job. Going through my own personal challenges, it was very hard to see and support him though I tried. I believe it was the same for him. 
This and all the other negative factors started taking its toll on our relationship. I forgot to mention, we have ALWAYS struggled financially. We have jumped between living in crappy private rentals, over-priced nice apartments we eventually decided to leave due to financial burdens, and my parent’s house. My husband never went to college or had any kind of formal training, so he has worked hard to get to where he is today. After low paying jobs and no advancement future, I decided to go back to college at the age of 26. I’m now thinking this was a bad idea. 
We stayed at this house for a little over two years while I finished my degrees. Even though my husband worked and supported us, and I worked 2-3 jobs consistently throughout full-time college courses, we always struggled financially or broke even (that rarely happened after his surgeries and the big vet expenses.) I had a successful college “career” having made the Dean’s list, worked various jobs for the money and experience that I thought it would provide me benefits in the real-world, was awarded outstanding student, was told with my job experience before and while in college and my education I’d have no problem finding a good job after graduation, blah, blah, blah. . .None of which matters now post-graduation.  
While living at this “trash” house, we ended up rescuing 3 cats. My 11-year-old lab I had rescued as a puppy—she’s NEVER leaving me. All the pets screwed us BIG TIME. Despite being responsible tenants, no other landlords were willing to rent to us—except one. We went to see the new possible house, which was a bit over-priced but nice, however the landlord’s husband made me very uncomfortable—so we never took the offer. I even talked to my landlord about moving into one of her nicer houses, but she discouraged it and lied to me saying it was smaller then what I was renting now—she neglected to say it had a full-finished basement. She didn’t want us to leave the “trash house” because she knew she would never find good tenants like us for that house. Sorry, I am diverting again. 
Anyway, with 4 cats and 1 dog, renting somewhere else, for a decent amount and in good condition became impossible. We could have gave up some of the cats but they are like our kids and that would have been very emotionally hard for us to do—remember, we spent $1,200 that put us back financially just to save, then make comfortable my kitten when he was dying. Our pets stay with us for life. 
I started looking for jobs that I was interested in before I graduated. I applied for many—not a single email or call back. I started lowering the bar a little, looked into decent paying jobs in fields I wasn’t as thrilled to work in—nothing. Five months later, I still do not have a job and I dropped the bar significantly, taking a seasonal job making $9 an hour just to have some kind of income and purpose for a short time.  
About a month and a half after graduation, the housing situation got worse. The landlord was pulling emotional strings and even though I had quit working for her, due to a mix of college obligations and tired of being taken advantage of and doing stuff for her for free all the time, she was still asking me to work when she went on vacation to Scotland, California, or whatever, and was still pulling tricks and manipulating me. Wanting me to fix the “trash” house while severely underpaying me for the work or no reimbursement. The neighbors were getting worse too. The actual shack owner got released from prison and shortly after the “house” got condemned which meant him and his riff-raff where living outside and trashing everything, not to mention I felt uncomfortable watching him do weird things like take an axe and beating all the trash in the yard. Yep! Living there was becoming unbearable and I was already extremely depressed. I had the desperate idea to move back in with my parents. . .again. 
My husband was worried about it because the other times we lived there failed miserably—my parents are hard to live with and I don’t have a great relationship with my mom—but I talked him into it saying I’m going to be depressed either place, at least there we can save money. The goal we have had for YEARS—except while I was in college—has been to buy our own home. We have always wanted to be homeowners but never been able to do it. We have never either had the right credit or the right income, but neither both at the same time. Good credit/bad income, good income/bad credit. It is not to say we have been financially irresponsible (in our early twenties, sure) but we have had to make financial sacrifices to just live paycheck to paycheck.  
Anyway, this is the third month living with my parents, 20 minutes from town (isolated), I have really no support system except my husband who I know I upset with all my crying and moping because he wants to help but doesn’t know how, and I am feeling worse off than ever before. I don’t regret moving here just to get out of our bad renting situation, but I am EXTREMELY unhappy, and I feel EXTREMELY trapped. When in college, I had worth and I had something to strive towards, I had people who supported me, so when I was feeling really low I found refuge and relief at college. Now I have NO refuge, no one to really talk to, no hope, and I am quickly sinking. 
When I get messages from friends saying “you have been quiet” I know I’m in a bad place. I am unmotivated, nothing gives me a sense of worth of purpose or happiness—even things I love. I’ve become distant and isolated from everyone. When I had my own house, I at the very least found worth in keeping my home clean, cooking, errands, etc., living with my parents I no longer have that purpose. We live in two rooms with 4 cats and a dog. Of course, they go outside and are allowed to go walk around the house, but that is limited because my dad has mild cat allergies and I don’t like my dog in there because they feed her large amounts of table scraps even though I do not allow it—despite being told MANY times not to feed her.
My parents have their own personal and mental challenges. My mom abuses prescription medication and has untreated bipolar disorder, my father is borderline an alcoholic. They both for some reason act very childish in their antics and attitudes which makes me feel like I am talking to or dealing with kids in adult bodies. For an example, one of my parent’s antics is they have adopted this strange voice while talking which they call the “minion” talk. Not a big deal, but they do it more than they talk normally or seriously. Normal adult conversations are very hard to have with them. I try to be cheerful around them so I don’t upset them—plus I don’t like people knowing I am upset—which is probably the reason I get so antisocial? I appreciate their willingness to let us rent/live off them (we do pay to live here) however, living with them has always been hard for one reason or another, and now even more so because I feel completely and utterly trapped. 
I’m recently graduated (which I thought and was told would be my ticket to a brighter future), student loan debt, 30 years old, no hope of a decent job/income anytime soon, no way to rent because of my pets or unless I want to rent from a slumlord or pay too much, and struggling with so many inner personal challenges. 
My relationship is good with my husband as he is my best friend and tries to support me in the best way he can, but it no longer feels like a passionate husband/wife relationship. Husband/wife feelings are no longer there nor are the activities. We have been together over 10 years and this is new which I assume is triggered by the whole situation and depression from us both. Don’t get me wrong, I have been depressed before and we have had countless personal and life struggles, but slowly the “passion” has evaporated since his surgeries and is now non-existent. This too, has been a problem and stressor, especially since moving back with parents. 
I never thought I’d be living with my parents and struggling with so many areas in my life at 30. I thought I’d be a homeowner and be starting a family. Not anytime soon as I see it—just trapped here in Ohio.

When was the ast time you felt happy,"When was the last time you remember being happy?  I would not be able to tell because it was so long ago i think that my memory would be faulty but i could guess.  And then I guess it would depend on what happy means to you as an individual.  I guess this is a stupid question because i can't even answer it myself.  maybe a better question is when is the last time you felt ok and not totally awful.  This is bizarre because i can't even answer this. i probably shouldn't even post this but what the heck.  if anyone wants to answer this, please do.  
i remember christmas morning when i was a kid i usuually felt very excited and happy if I remember correctly.  and  playing in the leaves when i was a kid was fun too.  going on vacations to lake.  i guess there were times as a kid when i felt happy but it was so long ago, i can't say that my memory is accurate.",depression

Brutal,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety pretty much my whole life. I'm 50 and when I was growing up there was far less awareness about these conditions. Right now, I'm going through a particularly bad time. These conditions have let to much pain in my life. Therapy, medication, meditation, exercise have all been tried. I know I'll somehow pull through this spell but this really sucks. I appreciate the forum as I know many people who have not suffered these conditions. They just don't understand. I appreciate the people in this forum who know my struggles. ",depression
Validation,"lots of things on my mind. The most over powering is my health issues. I had a severe flare up this morning, that has the possibility of spiraling into an anxiety/panic attack and making me feel so depressed. 
Though lately, I feel so depressed. I cant get into anything. I feel like im drowning in this thing called life, and the weight of my ongoing health /systematic problems/ is pulling me further down to a place where I cant breathe, where there is no hope of light. 
It scares me, as this things are out of my control. I know there are somethings I can do, but thinking about those right now makes me tired. 
Ive been working with counselor, Ive been talking about how angry I feel. all the ""why me"" ""i HATE THIS"" ""This really really sucks"" gets me all worked up! and at the moment thats all I can think about. That anger. 
I am aware of that. I suppose, I wanted some validation in feeling thats its okay to be angry at this current situation I am in.
Yesterday, I couldnt help cry on my way to school, although I know its a victory getting up/dressing/going to class...
despite acknowledging that, I feel nothing. I am angry. I am sad. Its not easy. Its tough, darlings. Crying on the bathroom floor, in pain, not knowing whats happening to you, because all you can feel is pain. Its very depressing. 
I decided not to go to school today (was planning to but things changed) and rest after that, though I wish I could shake off this sadness. Its just there... Oh god, I might start crying anytime soon.",depression
Not Myself ,"I don't even know how to begin here. I've been feeling sad and unmotivated for months now. Different things happened in my life and I didn't deal with them at the time. I'm someone who puts others before and holds everything in. 
My parents' divorce, a cousin's betrayal, a health scare, and car accident are the things that have contributed to my state today. 
My parents' divorce was first. This happened 13 years ago, when I was 24. I never dealt with my feelings on that. My mother was very emotional during this time, which made me emotional too. I hate that I got this from her.  My father asked for a divorce right after I graduated college. I planned to move out and start my own life and to this day I resent my father for ruining that for me. I say he ruined it for me because there was no way I could leave my mom then. I felt a responsibility to stay and help her with bills. She was an emotional mess and I felt like I was going through all that with her too. I stopped talking to my dad and at one point didn't speak to him for a couple years. We don't have a relationship to this day. Every time he messages me on FB, I cringe because I literally have to force myself to reply. It's not even a real conversation from my side because I still resent him for breaking up the family. I don't know how to get over that. My cousin betrayed my trust a few years after my parents' divorce, but I believe I am over this now.  I reached out to her a couple years ago and told her that I forgave her and that basically life is too short to live in the past (I know, I know...I could/should do the same for my dad, but I physically feel sick even thinking of doing that)
Then in 2017, I went for a check up for something and the test came back abnormal, so I had to get a more invasive test done, and those results (according to the doctor) were not good and according to them, required me to get a surgery. I went into panic mode right there in the office when this was said to me. I broke down and was scared my life depended on this surgery. I had a bad feeling about this doctor and my gut was telling me to not just take what she's telling me and get a second opinion and do more research. She basically tried to scare me into getting this surgery that I didn't need in the end because my test results were normal. I never felt so taken advantage of by a doctor than then. It completely made me lose trust in them and I hate and dread going to one today. 
Then in October of last year I got into a bad car accident. It wasn't my fault, but I hit someone at full speed and my car was totaled. It brought on such anxiety and fear to my life. I am still not over it and I'm still suffering physically because of it. Then the bills that have come in the mail. My head spins from it sometimes. 
my boyfriend has been very supportive with that, but we struggle to communicate with each other sometimes. Especially when I get emotional. He is a total opposite of me with his feelings. He can come off as being cold but that's not his intention. He just says it like it is. Sometimes when he says something to me, it comes out as cold or insensitive and I take it the wrong way and almost immediately just start crying. This happened last night. He then gets frustrated and upset because he feels he made me cry. And then we just sit there and stare at each other in silence. It's hard for him to show his emotions and talk about his feelings in a compassionate way. He's a veteran and sometimes I feel that is why he is like this. He was trained to not let emotions get in the way of things. So when this starts happening, I immediately start hating myself for crying and acting so weak. I don't want to break down for every single thing that is said to me.  It's exhausting. It's embarrassing. It makes me pitty myself and I lose motivation for pretty much anything. I used to do more self care in the past and that is non-existent right now. I don't do anything for myself. I don't find joy in doing things I used to do before (exercise, biking, healthy eating...) I feel useless, worthless, I have this fear that he will break up with me sometimes. I feel like my life is not going in the direction I want it to. I want a future with him. We started therapy this month because our intimacy is suffering. I just live in some kind of fear every day and I feel like I'm slowly being sucked into the darkness. 
How do I snap out of this?  I'm also in therapy myself, going tonight actually. Saying all this helps a little, but it's only temporary. ",depression

Am I a burden?,"

Sorry for the rant.
I have lost interest in things I enjoy and have found myself losing motivation to do anything. It takes me a lot of prompting to make myself do homework and study for tests. She said that my ADHD has nothing to do with my grades and that I need to stop talking back to her. She thinks that I'm being stubborn and rude for always talking back to her. Whenever I cry in front of my mom she first asks what’s wrong and then tells me to stop crying in an angry tone. She told me crying was a waste of energy and that I should be using that energy for studying. I’m losing my self-confidence and self-worth. I find so many things about myself that are terrible. I have been purposely not eating school lunch for two years to lose weight. I now use my lunch to do work and study to make myself feel like I'm at least being productive. I’ve always been underweight and so I’m making it worse for myself. What’s worse is that the doctor doesn’t like that I’m losing weight because I changed the type of ADHD pill I took to see if it would help with my focus. It didn’t. That was the last time I went to the doctors. I went to the doctor for my daily checkup last Monday. I gained back the weight I lost probably from the Christmas break. I gained 3+lbs lost 3 lbs and then gained the lbs back in a matter of 9 weeks. But I can't eat normal food that you would make at home at the moment because the stove and microwave don't work. We had to replace them and I think my mom wants the electrician to make sure that they are safe. I've been living off of mostly Wendy's food, and sometimes I get chicken fingers from a diner. This has been my dinner for the past few months now. I left the doctors and finding out I lost more weight and said I knew someone in my class that is depressed and lost weight. She told me “Well you’re not depressed.”  My mom told me that my friends told their parents, and the parents told my mom, that they are becoming stressed because I tell them about my complaints and my stress, such as when I would tell them about my mom’s ex-boyfriend. So I am to just bottle it up inside of me and pretend to be that bubbly, happy person I used to be. I don’t want to disappoint her but my mind is telling me I’m going to fail. I feel like I’m always being judged even when I’m not. I feel like I’m doing something wrong and that people hate me and that I’m just a burden. Because I am adopted, I feel like my mom would have been happier if she had adopted another baby who was better than me, who would be able to meet my mom's expectations. Maybe it would have been better if I didn't survive the flood. I was found after a flood in a basket in China when I was about 12 days old. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't been found. I don't think I've really impacted anyone's life for the better so it would be fine if I was replaced.

 I think I have depression. When I tell my mom about me having low self-esteem and stress she said that it’s just teenage hormones. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell any adults I know because I don’t want my mom getting in trouble. I don’t want them to blame my mom or anything.",depression

Work life - Sucks,"It has been so lonely at my job. I know I am not perfect, and I have accepted my personality contributes to how others treat me. However, every problem that triggers my anxiety and depression isn't my fault. I want to give notice and resign, but I don't have a replacement job yet, and that scares me. I also feel like these bad thoughts are in my head and I am making something of nothing. I fell I am being held back. I don't feel like I am growing.

good year secrets,"I had a very good year, financially, and made some positive changes in my life.  Here's how I did it.  1. Luck  When I was young, I was frequently bullied.  Not a whole lot of people helped.  This year I had a lot of good luck.  I have had children and grandchildren in good health who have brought joy to my life.  So I do not think you can evaluate your luck based upon one period or one year.   Overall I have been very fortunate.  2. Change is very hard   Changing your life or undoing bad habit will be hard, so the first thing, is do not underestimate the challenges.  And don't think other people do things so easily- the guy who hits a golf ball down the middle 250 yards probably took 100 lessons and practiced 5,000 hours.  So recognize the challenges and once you do and are committed to change, you have a better chance. 3. Confront challenges Attack things head one, you may face some initial stress, but do your best. 4. Be productively self-critical  I keep a list of things I have done wrong and how I could have done better, then I try not to ruminate too much about how I could have done better.  Again sometimes that is easier said then done and one doctor said I have high anxiety.  Again, I just work hard. 5. Your parents may be dysfunctional   Most golf coaches play good golf, understand the game, and may even be certified.  No certifications or prerequsites for being a parent.  A lot of them have challenges and their own emotional baggage.  Recognize your parents may not be perfect, you don't have to take their advice or accept their observations, but can still consider them parents

depressed today,"read a thread on twitter that really made me super sad & depressed. i've never been able to have a pet, never will due to health problems. & i'm a survivor of 4 decades of abuse w/ptsd. the thread was about pet animals that have saved a suicidal person's life. i've always had to save my own, even had to become a trained counselor just to get my life's memories back b/c the mental health industry in my city sucks (super conservative & religious). i wish so much that i could even pet an animal again. i love pics & vids of cute animals. but sometimes they also make me cry. like a lot. i just wish healthy people would be more willing to share their animal friends w/disabled persons. i miss my friend Steve who would share his pet dog Bud with me. he would always come to the park and stop to talk to me, and i got to pet Bud too. Steve died in 2017, so did Bud. & where i live now is not nearly as friendly as where i used to live. they're pretty distant here, & most work a lot. i miss living where other disabled and seniors lived. i'm just really down. i miss my friends. i have to live w/an asshole who has an anger management problem. he breaks stuff, slams doors, has tantrums, tries to start fights weekly, & is Narcissistic as hell. i end up having to fix what he breaks. just a real swell shitty guy. i'm saving up to move out, & have already completed the class for housing assistance. but it's still hurry up and wait, while i'm miserable.

Lost...,"This is my first post, so could be a bit long
I don't even know where to start, or what I'm trying to accomplish... 
I have not been 'formally' diagnosed with depression, but I know I have some issues. I'm 53 years old and I'm mom to 7 amazing kids, and a Grandma as well. I know that I have been depressed for a long time, but I had always  been the one that needed to be strong and there for my family.  Now I just can't pull myself out anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to about how I feel... My husband came here, to daily strength, years ago when he was having trouble. But, he doesn't even understand what I am going through. He thinks that I am upset because we are having serious financial issues. That is a stressor, for sure, but not the problem. I lost my job almost a year ago, started a small business that isn't doing great. I have looked for work, but have not been successful. With out a formal education, the only thing I can really do is fast food type jobs. I physically can't do those jobs anymore... He works for our landlord to pay our rent. So yeah, finances are a big deal, but not the whole problem. 
I don't eat, I don't shower, I don't have any motivation to work on my business, even though without it I can't pay my bills. I don't leave the house unless I have to. Most days, I don't get dressed. I have no friends. I know that I should be looking at the good in my life, but sometimes, that is so hard. My kids kept me going, a reason to keep going. Now, I have nothing to work toward... I'm just kinda lost... I don't know what to do, or how to do it. I'm in insurance 'limbo' so can't even go to the doctor...
I guess I just need to know that someone understands what I am going through, because no one here does. I haven't talked to my kids, I don't want to be a burden to them...

The Shocking Truth,"If one more person tells me to just 'cheer up' because 'it's not all that bad', I'm going to scream!
There are people who try to say they will support you, because they understand what it feels like to go through depression (""I've been sad because of ... before"" is always a lovely comment).
I'm not 'sad', I'm not 'upset'. I'm just not okay. I literally have got to a point where emotions seem to be a thing of the past. I don't have happy times, I don't have sad times - the reason behind it is because I've been that used to being judged on showing emotion that it seems easier not to.
But it is NOT easier! I'm going day by day, trying to put on a brave face and just get on with work and my life. I get up in the morning, I go to work, I come home. I force myself to eat, because not eating is also bad for you, I force myself to engage in conversation. I make it, by appearances, seem as if there is nothing wrong to the absolute BEST of my ability.
But why should I have to play this game? Why should I have to go through life being ashamed, just in case something thinks I'm just 'having a paddy' or 'attention seeking'? 
It eats me alive pretending that I'm okay, but what else can I do?

God Gives Us Signs,"My dear friends I know we struggle and felt compelled by God to share my day. For 49 years I have struggled with severe anxiety/depression and I can say that right now I am at one of my lowest points in life. I find myself in a situation that only God Himself can handle.
I have been praying so hard over the last several months. This morning I broke down crying and begging to Our Dear Lord Jesus for a sign of Hope…he sent two. One was a call from a friend that I haven’t seen since we had Thanksgiving. Next was a text from our realtor friend. I truly believe these events were NOT coincidence but the signs that I asked God to send.
In my current state of mind with my anxiety running out of control God gave me Hope! He gave me Hope for a Future! I know that I will always suffer degrees of anxiety/depression but what an amazing gift we have in Jesus Christ Our Lord!
I know how hard it is to keep Faith when our world is falling and crumbling around us BUT He IS with us and He WILL give us Hope and a Future! ~ Jeremiah 29:11",depression
Struggling after holidays,Have been struggling with depression and anxiety since Christmas ended. I was busy planning things for the holiday with my family and once that was over I feel empty.

Close to the end of the year, I plan to have enough money saved up. I want my own but I know it isn't going to happen that fast. All this time wasted chasing a dream that still hasn't happen.

Today I went to therapy and that helped me calm down. But all these jokes about world war 3 isn't funny. I'm already scared of life but now I'm even more scared. every night is a battle, I'm up with so many thoughts. I never feel truly safe. As a child, I have always been terrified. terrified of monsters under my bed, the dark and my sister and mom dying. now a lot of times I have to call my sister to make sure she isn't dead. I also have to check up on my mom in her room to make sure she is breathing. Every day I fear, every day I feel paranoid that something bad is going to happen. I'm not even sure anymore if my bed is safe. nothing feels safe anymore. I wish I can take me, my mom and sister of this earth and go to a safer planet. 
I know I'm 20 years old, but I don't feel like it. I feel like a little girl and I don't want to feel like an adult. I think its peter pan syndrome. I just want to cuddle under my blanket and watch cartoons and have all the hugs and love. I'm just a child. I don't want to die. I don't want my mom to die or my sister. it's not our time to go yet. they are still very young. I just want my mom to be safe and have a restful senior citizen life with no harm to her. so she can die peaceful and natural. 
I'm just so scared and I just want to be able to live in peace with the people I love.",depression
Needing encouragement,"Hi. It's my first time posting here. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of my life. Over the past couple months, it has become debilitating. I feel like a skeleton of a person... everything doctors have suggested over the years hasn't been effective (over 15 different antidepressant medications, even cutting edge treatments). I'm currently on an antidepressant and anxiety medicine, but I still feel awful. All I want to do is sleep. Sleeping is the only time I feel at peace. Any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated. ",depression
Does anyone get depressed about climate change?,"Lately I've been depressed about the climate changing, all the fires, the predictions of mass extinction, etc.  It really is disturbing to me and one of the most distrubing things that is a constant reminder is that it is too warm all the time!  Don't get me wrong, I'm not sad that this winter has not been brutally cold like usual but it's been freakishly warm and it just feels wrong.  I also feel really sad for all the animals that are being killed or dying and losing their habititat.  Can you imagine what that must be like for them?   And what is the plan.  I recycle, eat very little meat and wash the clothes on cold (sometimes) but that's about it.   I want to reverse this damage but I feel it's too late.  This really does make me sad and is troubling to the core of my being.  What about future generations?  What about the animals?  I just wanted to vent about that.  It's something that is starting to bother me on a daily basis.  Sometimes if feels like nobody really cares.  What are we supposed to do?",depression
Sudden switch,"I was happy and having a great life with my boyfriend but all of a sudden something switched. I'm depressed, irritated, anxious... my heart hurts my chest hurts and I just keep screaming in my head to stop myself from thinking and spiraling downwards. I'm usually good at recognizing what's bothering me but I cant figure it out. Does anyone else have sudden mood swings like this that last more than just one day? I feel bad for my boyfriend... I cant figure out what's wrong i keep randomly crying and he thinks it's because he did something but the true and honest answer is I have no clue why I'm like this!",depression
Validation,"I'm not sure if this really counts as a ""depression"" post, however, the subject that I need to get off my chest lower's my self-esteem. Here's a little insight of what's cooking in my head... My whole life I have never looked at the world black and white. It's not possible for life to be so simple unless you believe it to be that way. However, I don't. I think life is so complicated that majority of people cannot think so abstract (which has pros and cons in itself). We all have this urge to behave---to think---rightly. But who or what is to say what is right and what is wrong? 
Some individuals create their own sense of morals based off of religion. Some individuals believe in virtues and vices. Others think in black and white (though how they determine what action is which color is unknown to me). Either way, we follow a sort of moral compass which is great but what happens when the moral compasses clash together? Who is to say who right and/or wrong? Life can be simple or complicated---whichever way we wish it to be---but that does not give people the right to invalidate others' opinions.
People have invalidated me because.... I don't even know why exactly. For example (though NOT my main focus), I'm agnostic and if you don't know what it is, search it up. It is NOT atheism, let's get that cleared away. I personally don't know what to believe in and who knows what's going to happen. If there is a Heaven and Hell, great. If not, well something has to happen to us after we die, right? Even if it is a sense of nothingness. People on both sides of the arguement have given me so much crap. Atheists get pissed off because I don't think science answers everything. And then so many people have told me that I'm going to Hell because of my lack(?) of faith. I don't lack faith, I just don't know if I have it, I think there is a big difference between the two statements.
My point is, I am extremely willing to learn and listen to others. I will gladly say when I believe someone is right. But the second I express my views it's discredited. My roommate and I were talking about science a few weeks ago. She is a hardcore atheist but she is also very closed minded. And I won't get into the details about the conversation but I remember her saying, ""this is why I can't take you seriously"". And I have never felt so... invalidated. So I responded back with: ""because I'm not an atheist or because you're too close-minded to actually listen to me?"" Not my best comeback but I did manage to shut her up.
I brought up religion because in my mind it's more understable about what I'm trying to say. Like what really prompt me to write this post was a conversation I was having with my boyfriend. We were talking about the 2015 Michael Brown shooting. He is very Blue Lives Matter and his facts support his belief. I'm very.... Situational Lives Matter. I saw the points he was making and I even said that I agree with him on certain aspects. I did. However, my arguement was focused more on the sentimental and cultural view that was taking place in Ferguson as opposed to a specific group of people. He views the world in a very black-vs-white mindset where I think everything is gray.
Towards the end I ended up saying ""look, you need to relax because I am not attacking you in any way whatsoever. I just think that this situation is not as black and white as you think it is."" I still stand by that statement. I even told him that this is why I don't ever ""argue"" with him because it's like beating a dead horse. No matter what I say, he'll never change his mind or give me credit for my views. I don't need to be right all the time. I'm not asking for that. All I want is for someone to TRULY hear me and even agree that maybe it's not so black and white after all. Why are people so caught up in believing that they have to be right when maybe they're not? You want facts on why I believe the things I believe? Fine. I'll pull them right up but why do I need facts to prove my point? Why isn't my opinion enough? Why aren't my feelings enough? Besides, when we search for facts we look for the ones that support our opinion, right? So why bother with all of the sources just to bring our point across? 
I just hate it when people don't give me enough credit. It's like I'm dumb if I express whatever view that I have and then when I do pull up sources that support my opinion it still doesn't matter. Why is it so hard for people to accept the possibility that maybe they're wrong after all? Shit, for all we know 2+2 does not equal 4 (though I BELIEVE that it is 4). I just wish more people were open-minded and willing to listen... All I want is to be heard, is that too much to ask for? To not have someone who invalidates me all because I think differently.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk and letting me rant. I really needed to get this off my chest. I'm sorry if it's a little all over the place, I blame my ADHD and the fact that it's 2:30 in the morning. ",depression
So sad,Was in hospital last week for two days as had pneumonia and the flu. Saw my doctor yesterday and got a clean bill of health. Should be happy right? But not. You see I'm disabled and paralized on left side so have 24/7 aides. Out of 4 I'm down to 1. I knew when having these 20 year olds who like to party I would be in trouble but took a chance an now I'm fucked! (sorry) I'm entitled to light housekeeping besides the help with daily routines. If I don't do myself it doesn't get done so now I'm even more depressed. I need to use bathroom but scared to ask. Want to make a toasted bable but not suppose to use toaster as get burned. I guess ceral for me!,depression

Can we vote on WEIRD FACTOR?,"Ok, yes we all have our own forms of weirdness.  Let me share some info about a situation and just hear your opinion.   I am Buddhist.  I have ONE Buddha statue, at home and 2 small ones in my office. My supervisor who has often been a complete asshole to me, yet has also asked me to be his ""work wife"" said he had a couple of statues at home that he wanted to give me.  I just opened the bag, and he has sent me like 25 statues, very nice and wrapped like they had just been purchased from a specialty shop.   I'm confused,  he's not even Buddhist.  How do you have that many statues when you're not even Buddhist?????

Worst year of my life,"I will only address the issues that took place this month.
I received letter stating that I have to pay back my medical copays from 2019 because I made too much money in 2018 and veterans affairs would not cover it.
This could be up to $20,000 hopefully not more.
A week after that my wife informed me that I have to move out because she cannot take care of herself being around me because of my severe depression.
First I was suppose to move out after the new year. Then it's like she became a different person.
She became progressively more verbally abusive and gaslighted me all the time. If I said anything she would scream over me and say the most hurtful things she could come up with.
She said that she would make my life hell until I left.
A week before Christmas I couldn't take it anymore and I moved out.
At 39 I am separating from my wife and moved in with my grandma.
I am very lonely and have little hope. This is a so much to take at once.",depression
Anxiety/Depression running my Life/Relationship,"It has been a few years since I have posted on here but I am currently dealing with so much anxiety and depression I feel like I am ruining my relationship. My significant other is very laid back and does not ever worry and always goes with the flow so he does not ever understand what I feel. He tries to empathize but I feel with the longer we are together the harder it is for him to be patient. 
Bckstory about me. I am a 33 year old female that has been battling anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was a child who cried all the time, I was on zoloft about 13 years ago that made me a zombie, I took lorazepam situationally about 5 years ago which caused blackouts and have been in and out of therapy.  I have always been uptight and neurotic and it especially comes out when I am in a relationship. I tend to be happier single because I am more able to control the situations I am in and remove myself when I become uncomfortable. Believe it or not I have a large social network and lifelong friendships who I see when I choose. I tend to avoid relationships because I do not like the fact that I dont have as much control in situations. I cant control their habits, their social life or whatever it is they do that might cause me anxiety. I find myself acting out because of my anxiety which in turn makes me very depressed.
My boyfriend and I moved in about 6 months ago and it has been a rollercoaster. On top of being opposites in all ways, we have very different sleep patterns and social patterns. I am much more of an introvert who likes to socialize for a bit then go back home to my safe haven. I go to bed early and I don't like the bar scene and feel uncomfortable when being forced to stay out late or being with large groups of people I don't know well. The disagreements that have come from this have caused me so much anxiety that I feel myself trying to grasp for more and more control which backfires on me. I just spent 6 days in my boyfriends hometown with his family and friends that was almost painful for me because I did not have a safe haven to retreat to. I had to go along with him and his friends plans whether I liked it or not. When i am in a situation I feel I am stuck in I recognize myself becoming mean, irritable, and combative with not just my significant other but those around me. I completely recognize it but it is like my eyes glaze over, I see red and lash out as if something came over me. I know that I am not a bad person and I don't want to categorize myself as a crazy girl but I feel like my anxiety dictates my emotions and I don't want his friends or family to dislike me.
Over the course of the last few months socializing has become hard for me. I loved doing crossfit 5 days a week for the last 7-8 years and now it is a struggle to get into the gym at all. I have become less open to trying new things and really am finding it hard to get outside of my routine. Even though my boyfriend tells me he loves me, I get very depressed because I feel like I am a burden on him. I don't understand why someone would want to stay with me. I feel unlovable. I had a break down last week the day before I was supposed to go meet him and his family for christmas because I felt like no one really cared if I was there or not because there was too much ""ambiguity"" in the plans. I needed a set plan given to me for each day so I could mentally prepare ahead of time for each scenario I might encounter and figure out my exit strategy.
Currently we have some friends of his in town staying with us and we have plans to go to a late night concert tonight and I freaked out last night because I was the only one who was trying to prepare for tonight by going to bed early and getting a good night sleep. They all stayed up partying until 3AM, kept me up awake and and they are all still sleeping when it is almost noon. I feel like I can't go to the concert now because I did not get enough sleep. I find that in every situation I have to make a strategy of how to go about it and if it veers off plan I go into a depression.
I am not able to just ""enjoy"" my life like most people can. My boyfriend's number one priority in life is to have fun and enjoy life and that upsets me because I feel like my life is about survival and making it one day to the next. I feel alone that he can't feel what I feel. On a Friday night when he wants to stay up late so he can just have a fun night he does not realize the thoughts going through my head are..."" I need to fall asleep now, if I dont fall asleep now then I will either not sleep in and feel like crap the tomorrow or sleep in late and ruin my day. If I sleep in late then I am a piece of s*** that accomplished nothing for the day and my day will be completely messed up and I wont be able to enjoy tomorrow night. I need to rest this weekend. I am too old to stay up late anymore. this will never work."" And this is like an almost weekly thought process that causes me so much exhaustion and constant fatigue because I in turn can't sleep worried about how I am not meeting my own expectations.
Anyways, These are just some examples of my every day life and the prison I feel that I am in. I really don't want to go on meds again but just wondering if there is anyone else out there who feels their anxiety taking over their life.",depression

First Post,I am new on here and I have gone to support groups in the past as well. I have struggled with depression for years and it comes in waves all the time. One minute i am happy and the next i cant help but feel inadequate and that i let everyone down who were counting on me to do something. An exapmple would be getting everyone something that they would really love for Christmas but always feeling like the gift they get is never enough. I guess i need to lower my expectations for myself but i dont know how to do that. Any advise would be helpful. ,depression
Self esteem getting lower,My self esteem has progressively become worse  over the past few years. It's never been very hight to begin with but getting ready to leave can easily ruin my day.  I can feel slightly ok and catch a glimpse of my slef and my mood just drops. My husband will make comments about getting me some lingerie but I just cringe because I know how I will feel. It's hurting my marriage. I'm content in wearing layers and even avoid him touching me so we don't have to have sex. I will try to make sure the lights are off or I try to cover myself if we do anything. I just want to feel ok and not constantly worry  and hate how I look.,depression
Tired of living.....,"Im so tired of living, I dont get excited over the little things anymore or enjoy them For example, my birthday was on the 13th and all i could think about was suicide, matter of fact that was the closest i have ever came to suicide in my life.

So sad today,"I'm sorry to be a bummer on Christmas.  Merry Christmas to everyone!  I am just feeling very sad.  My family (human and cat) are aging, they are very old.  My 20 year old cat seems not to be feeling as well as usual today.  I know he has kidney disease but he's been doing ok with it for quite awhile.  I gave him some fluid and his meds and now he's under the couch by the heater.
My dad gave me a really nice personal gift.  We have had a rocky time of it thanks to his abuse in my childhood, etc. but the gift touched me. It's personal and homemade and very special.  He lives far away.  My mom is not with me today because she is visiting with relatives.  I'm not getting along with my siblings and so we did not exchange cards or gifts.  Both my parents are in their 80's.
I try to stay positive but it's nearly impossible.  I am so alone and so scared of losing what little support I have.  My body is tired and breaking down.  And I am very depressed.  My attempts to make friends and get any kind of romantic relationship have failed.  I think about ending my life to stop this march into a terrifying and unbearably lonely future.
I honestly wish I had what it took to accomplish this.  I don't think I do.  I'm scared for myself.  I guess I am a weak person.  I've tried to reach out for support and the only genuine support and caring I have found is here.  My doctor knows I have suicidal thoughts and am very depressed and he does nothing about it.  He never even askes me ""how are you?"" when I come in.  My therapist is cold.  When I talk she stares at me like she can't wait for it to be over and that's pretty much the reaction I get from anyone I talk to in person.  After about 5 seconds their eyes glaze over and they look desperate to get away from me.
My future is so scary.  I'm not the kind of person who can be utterly alone.  It doesn't even really make sense to me.  I'm not perfect but I'm not THAT awful.  I wanted to get married and have kids.  It never happened.  I used to even pursue men I was interested in but they all rejected me.  This has been going on for decades.  They just have no interest.  
My life feels like I'm falling off a cliff and I know the end is awful but I can't stop the fall.  I wish medical people would euthanized humans for things other than terminal illness such as people whose lives are unbearable for them.  Who wake up every morning sick with fear and terror and loneliness just wishing to die.  I have thought of asking my doctor if he would help me end my life because if I do try, I don't want to botch it.  Once I tried to hang myself and failed and had a pain in the side of my neck for months after.
I think some of the things that people say are untrue such as  ""It will get better"" or ""if you die you will hurt so many people that you leave behind"" or ""that's just the depression, if you go to therapy and get meds, you'll be ok again"" etc.  Let me say that my experience is that it doesn't necessarily get better, it can also get worse and worse.  About the second one, I think there are many people in this world who could end their lives and no one would really care.  And as far as getting therapy and meds, that doesn't always work.
Being alone puts you at such a greater risk in life to not survive.  Look at animals in the wild.  When an animal leaves the herd or is shunned, what happens.  Chances of it's survival drop hugely.  I guess I should stop this morbid rant.  I'm sorry.  This is how I feel.  This is my reality.  Reality is just that.  It's real.  Nothing can stop it or change it no matter how much we wish it so.  We can try, which is what I always do, but life is going to unfold however the hell it wants. 
I'm in the fall and headed toward the ground.  I guess I just wanted to talk about it.  Thank you for listening.  And I do hope you have a nice holiday.  I will have a cup of tea and watch some videos and take care of my cat today.

Dreams So Close,"How can you keep it together knowing that you've worked so hard for something and it's still just out of reach?I've been wanting to move. I've saved and worked on my credit for 5 years. It's hard to do on disability alone. My credit score hasn't changed even though all my bills are paid. All I have is a house payment. (Medical bills are in a collection agency that won't report unless I don't pay). Now I find out I can't get a lower interest rate because I don't have enough credit accounts.My Loan officer referred me to a Financial Advisor and instructed me to get a credit card. Capital One and another denied me. That's 2 Big Hits to my score wasted. I finally went to my Credit Union and they gave me an unsecured one, another Big Hit.Now I have to use the card regularly and wait at least 3 months to see any increase.My current house is in a State I hate. It's old and needs repair. A school said they wanted it to tear down to make parking however they've been stringing me around for almost 2 years. Same with the investor who owns a house next to me. He wants to make it into 2 apartments.My children still home have not helped since my husband passed away in 2011. It's worse now since I can't work because I can't walk all the time and have been disabled since 2014. They have said the house is all my job since I'm home all the time while they are at school. My house is no longer a home, but a shell in which we just exist. My house looks like that of a hoarder because of trying to clean and no help to take the garbage down the hill to the curb (except for my daughter's boyfriend who said for $20).My neighbor's renters have brought their bleeding wife to my door at 1 AM because he stabbed her. Another felt it necessary to shake his privates at me telling me how much I want him. 2 drug busts, dogs running loose and shooed into my garden to poop. Tire ruts in my garden from when they kept trying to turn around (my garden is made of soft mulch, not hard soil), the backside of my sheds are caving in from all the hits & kicks. I've even gone as far as to put wood fencing behind them and they pull it down constantly. Even with surveillance video and my camera, the police say they are all civil matters and my attorney said it would cost more to go to court than to repair all the damage and put up with the lude acts. Thus giving renters the right to destroy other people's property leaving the landlord's blameless.The Counselors call it stress, I call it BS. It makes my Anxiety & Depression High because I can't afford to do anything about it.Rant over.",depression
The Last Word - a missed opportunity,"Yesterday discovered that a very dear close friend passed away... her last words to me a month ago was ""please do not call me again"", as she laid in rehab fighting for her life.  Where I didn't understand her meaning, it was actually her last words to me.  I tried to reach her after 30 days of honoring her request, and she would not answer her phone, so I contacted the nursing desk to ask them to send a message to my friend.  I don't know if they ever did this, but I wanted my friend to hear that she was missed, and we were all hoping for her to move back here very soon. I also wanted to tell her about the moon in the sky, we were always talking about the moon in the sky. I left my name and hung up, never to see or hear from her again.
Last summer at a community gathering, a woman who had chosen to remain isolated in her home, appeared and sat beside me.  She had much to say much to my chagrin because I wanted to enjoy the day, not listen to her natterings.  Annoyed I got out of my chair to move away and her last whispered words to me was ""Goodbye"" and she passed away last month.  I remember saying to myself, I should go and visit with her as her last words to me haunted me, but I never did and now it's too late.
Just recently in my book club sits a very disabled man.  I have grown close to him, or as close as he will let me.  He and my grandfather would have liked each other due to their background.  He made a comment once in book club that he found himself ugly.  Months went by and an urgency grew, I needed to talk to him and let him know that he's a very valued member where I live and that he's beautiful from within.  He always stands and holds out my chair for me to sit in, he laughs at my jokes, he pays attention to me.  So, one day, leaving book club, I caught up with him and called out ""Charles, I need to say something to you"".  We sat down at a bench nearby and I got my opportunity to tell him just how beautiful he is inside and how much I value his friendship.  He is still alive and I keep missing him again as I was not able to get to book club recently, but still looking forward to seeing him again very soon.  I see him pass by my window daily as he walks back and forth to lunch and I say a little prayer for him.
Ten years ago, at a high school reunion, a neighbor I had grown up with made a passing comment ""Your dad was the best, he treated me like the son he never had, I loved your dad"". Now this caught me by surprise as my father was my child abuser and he told me how much he hated me.  Just to think he was kind and loving to another child was beyond me.   I had all intentions of talking to my neighbor about his childhood experiences with my father.  In fact, I left several messages across the world, for my neighbor to talk more about my dad.  He never did return my phone calls and he passed away the same day 10 years apart that my father died.  I never got the chance to talk to him. 
Estranagment from my family of origin caused me to miss my last words from my father.  Even though he was my childhood abuser, I never allowed myself to be open to his caring ways towards me as he aged and towards the end of his life.  He used to call me ""Number One"" in front of a family who hated me. I never acknowledged his comment as I would shake in fear over what my other family members would do to me. In his last days, he wrote me a letter imploring me to see him one last time. I never went and never saw him again.  A decade passed by and one day I got up the nerve to read his last letter to me, as my mother wrote on the front of the envelope ""Your dad's last words"".  There was nothing but hen scratches there, nothing that made any sense, but I only guess he was trying to speak volumnes to me. I will never hear his voice nor know what he wanted me to hear. 
The last word out of my sisters mouth when I pleaded with her to build a ""mother-in-law suite"" to the home she robbed from me at my mother's passing, is that I told her that I would be come homeless very soon and her last words to me was ""at least you know where you will end up"".
I will add to this as there is alot more.  Perhaps this belongs in my journal, but wanted to start a thread about the importance of last words.............",depression

Annoying as Fuck,"Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all-- I hope everyone is having a great holiday season. I am not having a bad one, actually, except for the fact that my mom is driving me crazy right now. I admit it's a little thing, and it's not wrecking my holiday or anything like that. But she has been needy and neurotic this whole time. She insists on being insulted and irritated by the most ridiculous things. Example: we are going to play a board game soon and my dad said he just wanted to watch the last 10 minutes of an episode of a TV series we got him for Christmas. There was a misunderstanding because he thought we had said that wasn't okay but then we explained it was fine; my mom says, ""You just want to cast every woman who disagrees with you as being a witch!"" WTF? And she is letting my grandma get to her. While we were washing up after dinner she started ranting about how sick of my grandma she is and how she always gets to her. I was getting pretty annoyed at that point and simply said, ""Well you let her get to you."" She was silent after that. I guess that's what always irritates me about my mom; she complains and gets riled up about things that either a) aren't worth getting upset over or b) are completely within her control. She complains all the time about my dad having been selfish when I was a kid. Well yeah, he was-- but she never complained about it to him either. She never brought it up. She never stood up for herself at all. I'll reiterate that my Christmas hasn't been bad, in fact, I'm really enjoying just relaxing with my family. I just had to let off steam about how my mom, whom I love very much, is annoying. As all moms probably are. I just needed to vent a little before we start playing the game. ",depression
Why can I not see happiness in my future at age 45,"It is all over, I am too old, why bother, Im only going to die at 65 anyway.I REALLY wanted a family, kids. Both partners that were potentials lied to me and one aborted behind my back.Im too old to find a woman who would want my babies.Im not able to work right now as I have back issues.I feel like a failure at age 45yo I used up all my savings before social care would help.I have no family I can have relationships with (this is a case of them not me this time).I use to have a modest but quite wealthy 6 figure income. I want that back. I want my girlfriend with pretty blue eyes that loves me, I want kids with her that share our good looks and smart brains. BUT IM 45yo, 46 soon. :-(",depression

Sad,"I feel sad today and very anxious.  A lot is not going well.  I dread leaving the house.  I want to feel safe in the world and I don't.  My stomach is upset and my heart is racing off and on.  Life seems like torture to me most of the time and my body is so tired i feel like just dropping on the sidewalk where i am walking and laying there curled up in a ball. I've been off work sick for a week which is bad but I need longer.  I need to feel love and not hate or annoyance or aggression or indifference or pity which is what i get from most of the people out there most of the time.  I hate how fast paced life is, how competitive.  I hate how cars revv their engines and how people drive so aggressively,  i hate loud talking and shouting, being watched and looked at and judged.  Oh, i want to stay in all the time.  I have to go out pretty soon to a doctor appointment which i dread and then tomorrow I have to try to go to work where I am not wanted or liked. My stomach knots just thinking of going to work.  When will this end.  It's never going to end.  It just keeps getting harder.  ",depression
Accomplishment,"I accomplished something this year and became reasonably well-organized.  I'm proud of that.  Now I'm not excellent, but average, but average is a very good thing for me.  I'm someone who did not get papers in on time in school, lost things, etc.  Some things to report about self-improvement.  1. It's hard.  We seem to have this idea notion things can be easily changed.  If you want to improve, that's good but recognize it's a demanding task.  2. You will periodically fail and failure's a part of life.  50% of coaches will have a losing record, only 25% will be in the playoffs.  So try to accept partial failure and deal with it.  That means trying  to understand what went wrong, not to condemn yourself, but work to improve.  You create better procedures, try to learn, read, think, and then hopefully do better- 2 steps forward, 1 back.  For example, there's people who remember where they put things, and do 10 things at once.  Me, I'm the last person off the airplane, after 3 times checking whether I left something and a good process helps.     3. Be careful of comparisons to others.  There's a Hassidic saying, when Zussa passes, the question is not whether he was like Moses, a prophet, but Zussa, given his abilities and circumstances in life, did he work to accomplish what he could.  I play a sport against a family member who is far more skilled.  I don't expect to win, but enjoy playing and seeing did I play as well as I could.  ",depression
Hello,"hi everyone, I haven’t been on in a few months. Had some health issues and what not, but am doing much better. Has anyone ever seen this YouTube channel called cream heroes?

Barely hanging on,"I've suffered from depression and social anxiety my entire life, sometimes worse than others. I hurt my back a year and a half ago, and that was the beginning of a real downward slide for me. I work from home, so I almost never have to leave the house. I had a quilting business that was just starting to take off but I've closed it down because I just have no interest in it anymore. All I want to do is sleep. From the time I wake up, I count the hours until I can go back to bed.
I recognized a few months ago that things were really bad - I'm scared to leave the house or have people here, I think of ways I could die naturally. I'm not suicidal, I just wouldn't mind not waking up one day. So I called the psychiatrist if been seeing the last few years only to find she'd gotten into some legal trouble and disappeared. I managed to find a doc that put me back on Wellbutrin, and I'm really hoping that will help. It's only been about 2 1/2 weeks so I know it's early yet.
I just don't know what to do. My husband is wonderful but very worried about me. I try and keep all of this from my adult daughter, but she's not blind. I just don't care about anything anymore. I usually love everything about Christmas, but I'm just going through the motions. My daughter is coming home and while I want to see her, I just feel... flat. 
I wouldn't exactly call this a crisis, I guess. I've been more or less like this for a year or more, I just... I don't care about anything, and I miss caring. I miss being excited about something, anything. The only thing that excites me these days is sleeping. I don't know why I'm even posting this. I don't expect anything, I guess I just needed to get it out, I needed to be heard. 
Ok, time to put my social face on. Family is coming home. Thanks for listening, if anyone is out there.

Struggling with the holidays,"It's amazing how many people are struggling with the holidays.  Me too.  We almost need a holiday support group in itself because i know that Christmas isn't the only one that's hard.  I find Thanksgiving kind of hard and birthdays, too.  It's really hard when you are alone.  Part of me has gotten used to it but part of me feels extra sad around this time of year.  And yea, to see people all around you at the stores out shopping with their families, really excited and happy sort of rubs it in.  There's too much pressure around this time of year to be happy and to be with families that a lot of times are totally toxic.  Well, that's it.  I'll probalby be alone on Christmas because my mom is going to my sister's house and i refuse to go there and be around people who have caused me so much pain and harm throughout the year.  I fake my way through quite a bit of family stuff but not this year.  I need to rest and take care of myself.  I'll have my cat with me and he's nice.",depression
Christmas Blues -Help,"Its nearly Christmas, I have to go to a Pantomine tonight (british tradition)  I'm not interested this year we've done about 28 of them now and I've had enough, the reason for going is our anniversary if it wasnt for my daughter who is 24 years old, I wouldnt go, they cost an awful lot for tickets.  And tend to be similiar every years.  My cousins who I was close to as a child havent bothered to send Christmas Cards so far, and they are all going to see each other over the holidays, I'm not asked, we grew up together, I was the poor cousin, who they played with.  That lived on a council estate, they lived in a big house which was mortgaged, my aunt was a comprehensive teacher, my uincle a professor of maths.  We were very close, but now we've drifted appart.  If I had a degree they would probably bother with me.  One is a professor, one an opera singer, and the other has a BSc, but is actually a stay at home wife with being a priests wife.  I feel really left out, and depressed.
Christmas I'm going to have to act my way through, unless my mood changes, for Emma and Gareth's sake.  I'll be glad when its all over.  The advertisements on TV are depressing, people having big parties, we used to, but the  older generation have died, the younger have gone to funerals only now.  
I really cant explain why I feel this way, it doesnt help that it would have been my dads birthday on 24th (Christmas Eve), he would be 82, he was funny and could make you laugh.  My mum is dead too, I did music with her thats gone as well.  Its not the same doing it on my own, I cant afford to join a choir it costs too much.  People dont realise that its an expensive hobby.
I feel like I want to run away, disappear into the mist to somewhere i feel safe, safe as in calm, not having to look after Emma who is disabled and has a lot of medical problems.  There is no one else.  She does get 2 days respite, but thats all.  There is no one to relieve me as Gareth doesnt cope with her seizures well, and Emma feels safer with me.
Help!

Depressive episode,"Hi, I'm new here. I am in the midst of a major depressive episode with thoughts of suicide. My husband of 12 years wants a divorce, and I am going back to school so that I can have a career to support my 2 kids.

Why do other peoples opinoins matter so much to me,I have always felt like I dont fit in. And I would look for proof that people think the same thing. I think it has gotten worse being sober and not working. I feel judged. I try to remind myself that Ive overcome so many odds..alcoholic home as a child.. moving back and forth to south florida trying my best to come back from a 7 year battle with heroin and xanax and then 12 months after I got clean I lost my daughter..09/24/2018..Being home I have to deal with all the people i made an ass out of myself infront of while I was using..and it keeps me indoors for the most part. I am to embarassed to explain further.... But working in this area is just not an option at the moment.. Maybe people look at me like I try to justify not working and being dependent. Maybe this is just my paranoia. Maybe its because i actually judge myself. .. Ive been considering applying for disability for the time being. I just dont know what to do somedays. And then other days I look at society like I was screwed from day one. Im not meant to fit into the box of this society...and i look at the people that I think are juding me and im angry. And then somedays I try to love everyone and remind myself that we all have different experiences. Still doesnt change the fact that peoples opinions truly matter to me. Sometimes I wish there was a book of my life and people I come in contact with could read that book and have empathy...But honestly thats a selfish thought....My head is manic I think..lol maybe I need to be on the bipolar group..but this one seems to be more my speed.,depression

"Here again, nightmare mirrors life","Bad nightmare last night.  Mirrored my life.  So weird.  At the end the nightmare voice said ""what is the lesson"".  It's too late to go into detail now.  It was awful and it was just life real life.  What is the lesson?  I don't know.  I mean I know but knowing doesn't do any good.
What I really want to write about is how every human being in my life has let me down.  I feel the most connection here and no offense, but that is really disturbing to me.  I called the suicide hotline last night and got some chirpy non compassionate type person.  It made me feel even more alone.
I have to somehow get through the next 6 months of work, hell, just getting through tomorrow seems impossible.  I need a love, real love.  I need that so bad.  I need someone who is on my side and who has my back and can help me out once in awhile even financially.  I need a break so bad and I'm not going to get it.
I'm missing my bedtime.  better get to bed.  i go to bed angry almost every night, like really angry, in a rage, acid blood in my veins and gut.  there is something wrong with me.  Really.  I'm not normal.  My life is a terrifying nightmare of loneliness, disconnection and physical pain and hardship and gaslighting and manipulatoin and abuse from my family.
I've been overeating a lot because it makes me feel good temporarily and dulls the pain.  I just want this nightmare to end.  It all started and continues with having an awful, crazy family.  I cannot shake them.  I just cannot get them out of my life.  They will kill me.  They will kill me if I cannot get away from them.",depression
Unexpected!!!,"Update...my grandmother passed away December 12th. This Thursday passed. We really never know when our time is coming. I will say, this time I wasn't angry at God because I know my grandmother was tired. But I just want all of this make sense. Its been six months since my father died and now my grandmother is gone. I was so close to her. I don't even know if I'll be able to handle her funeral. Me and my aunt fly out tomorrow morning to Georgia. I want to know what is God preparing me for. If He doesn't want me to be a professional singer, I wish He just give me a sign. If He wants me to do something else, I hope it's something that I can do AND interested in. its just so overwhelming to have to deal with another love one's death. I know we all have to go one day, but this is so crazy to me. I lost my brother in October 2018, Ms. Norma this summer of May 2019, my dad in June 2019, my Auntie Nita in August 2019, and now my grandmother. A week and six days before Christmas.
The next month after losing my brother, I was fraught with this feeling of death. The first time I felt it, I was nervous and scared and didn't know why I was feeling. In that month a lot of changes were happening. I was staying in South Carolina because home wasn't healthy any more and I couldn't take it, so I thought maybe it was a sign that the old me was dying or something. But even going into the year of 2019, I kept feeling it and kept feeling it. When I left for California, that's when I stopped feeling that feeling of death. Now, sitting here thinking about that feeling I was having, what if this is what that feeling was. Giving me a warning that close love ones to me were not going to be here on this earth much longer and I didn't even see it coming. 
I just need God to make it clear.",depression
Hello Everyone,Hey! all I am new to this forum and wanted to say hello to all of you.,depression
Is it depression or my relationship?,"I've suffered with depression for almost a decade now and it has ruined everything about my life. Any hobbies that I enjoy, I soon despise after finding reasons to hate them and no longer enjoy them. For one example, I was THRILLED to go to college a couple years ago, but shortly after I started hating it, secluded myself, stopped eating, and complained to my parents about how much I wanted to come back home. I stuck with it and graduated, but convinced myself it was the worst time of my life and have barely any memories of it now. Now, I would KILL to redo that time of my life and it pains me every day knowing that I gave up the greatest years of my life so easily to my depression.

Now, this is affecting my relationship. I made it 3 years without this happening. My boyfriend was everything to me and I cherished him so much because he took all the pain away. Now, I'm like convincing myself it's not working out after we moved in together earlier this year. Just like in college and everything else, I'm finding reasons to not want to be in this anymore. To be fair, he has done stuff that other girls probably would have left him for long ago, but I always forgave it because he made me happy. But now, all of that stuff is floating back up and I'm starting to resent him for it. Still, there are days when I fall in love with him all over again and couldn't imagine my life without him. I'm scared because I don't know if my depression is making me hate my relationship or if I'm actually just unhappy in my relationship. I've told him exactly that and he says he will never give up on me, which makes me feel terrible for even thinking like this because he's stuck with me through so, so, so much crap. I don't know what to do.",depression

Dreading seeing a family member this Christmas,"Hi everyone,
I'm starting to dread seeing a particular family member this Christmas. She recently became a part of my husband's extended family. We are both in a similar healthcare career but she acts judgmental and comes off as fake. She is a huge trigger to me after dealing with mean girls like her in high school. It's hard for me to believe that she wakes up every morning and goes to work to ""help"" people when she acts very different around others in her personal life. She cares a whole lot about material things and tries to one-up everyone whenever she gets the chance.  I feel my chest tighten up and start to shake when I even think about her, much less be around her. And to make matters worse, I have opened up to a few family members that she bothers me, so I feel like they are watching me when I am interacting with her. I don't want to be rude to her, but it's really hard to hide my true feelings. People have told me to let it go but I am having such a hard time. Anyone go through anything similar? ",depression
Hello from a new member,"Hi everyone. I'm glad to have found this forum, and I joined for one reason. I don't have clinical depression, but I think I have situational depression.

Every day I get some push to start reading books again or to write, but then I feel like it's a waste of my time if the country is nearly destroyed. I feel helpless to make any sort of positive impact. It just feels like I'm surrounded by fearful and hateful people, even if that may not be the case.

Update!,"My grandmother is doing better. I'm happy about that. 
I'm taking a break from social media and talking to people I guess you can say. I've been getting this feeling that God is telling me to stop the things that I have been doing trying to get ""famous"" and my career moving because there are still things that I need to work on with myself. I haven't healed completely. I still seek my own personal revenge with certain people from my past and present. I don't want to be that person. I want my life to start happening, but because I still have hurt and anger in my heart, I believe God is not allowing my dreams to come true. What I'm considering as punishment, God is probably seeing this as an opportunity to let Him in to heal me. I'm not going to lie, this is going to be hard because I don't want to do it. I whether be rich and alone and able to afford the things I want and need. But God doesn't want that for me. He wants me to have abundance, but He wants to make sure I know how to keep it. He doesn't want me to be alone, but He needs to heal me from my past fully in order to bring the people in my life who are meant to stay. Acceptance is the beginning of the process, so there's my start. 
I'm not worried if people will be looking for me because I know they won't. I need to take this solitude seriously and heal. Really listen to God and what He wants to tell me. I know that its not going to happen over night. That's the part that even makes me even more mad. I have to do this because nobody will do it for me. I don't think God is going to send someone along to help me with this and its kind of bittersweet. Having someone there would help me believe that not everyone is evil. But doing it alone will give me a better look at myself. I don't see my self worth and I don't see myself as someone who is deserving because everyone who hurt me, parents included, spoke with their actions to show me I wasn't worth it and I believed it. I have for too long and its just time to make a change. 
I did say 2020 was going to be the year I do the things I need to do to see myself in a better light. I want to look at me as if I've always been worth it and that the people who neglected me, it had nothing to do with me. So here's to the start of a new journey that I will actually do this time. Here's to making a new change for the good.",depression
Postpartum depression,"Hello, so I had my daughter on 11/10/19 after a 7 week stay in the hospital on bedrest. I got diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum at week 5 of my pregnancy and was super sick. At week 15 I got put on bedrest due to high blood pressure & then got admitted to the hospital at week 29 for a 24 hour observation which turned into a 7 week stay. It would have been longer if I made it to full term.  I was induced at 35 weeks due to high liver enzymes, my kidneys had begun to shut down & my blood pressure began to sky rocket again despite being stable for weeks.  I spent 72 hours in labor and my daughter finally made her appearance. She spent 23 days in the NICU and just turned a month old on the 10th of December, she has been home for a little more than a week.  Today I had my post OP appointment, my doctor diagnosed me with postpartum depression and has started me on zoloft. Now I struggled with manic depression & anxiety prior to pregnancy, so I really just thought it was that and needed an adjustment of meds.  I just feel like I am failing all over again, I had such a rough and complicated pregnancy, a 7 week stay in the hospital and away from my son & husband most of the time, and then had a 23 stay in the NICU where I had to chose between which child to spend time with. It's been hard. I thought it would get easier once we were all home and together but its not.  It Christmas time, but I'm not at all looking forward to it. I wont be with the rest of my family, I dont have money to do much of anything for anyone, and I know my days with my daughter are coming to an end as I will have to start looking for a job after the holidays. I just hope this gets easier. I feel so alone. I know I'm not alone but it's how I feel :( ",depression

This year,"This year may have been one of my hardest yet. Christmas Eve 2018 my grandfather passed away. Thats when things began to snowball. My mother started acting irrationally. This led to us find out many things she was hiding..the lack of care she was providing my grandparents the large sums of money she had taken from them. She turned physical which lead to my aunt stepping in and caring for my grandmother and my 14 year old brother to come live with me. Me and my aunt grew closer  then one day the calls became shorter then they stopped.  In May we had the police do a well check. They found her on her couch where she had been for 3 days. She had been an alcoholic for years and it finally just shut her body down. I was now left to take care of my grandma who was on last stages of Alzheimer's. Granted she was not in my home but I was her legal guardian. I visited her multiple times a week most of the time her not know who I was. In September she passed away. I couldn't even count on my own mother to help the funeral. I'm still struggling to care for my own kids as well as my brother. We are struggling to pay bills all while she just sits at home worries for nothing and is about to inherit around a million dollars.

Christmas Eve,"Does anyone have a particular family tradition, or isolated tradition that you do for the day or night? In our family we normally go out to dinner Christmas Eve. Whether it was to spend time with other family outside of the immediate ones or just us, this year, like the last few years I've found my input and thought dismissed. It's very discouraging. Going into the start of the month I started wondering what plans we might make this year. It's just five of us, so the usual number. With a couple of them out of state and arriving it's nice to catch up on things and bond a little more than just emails or texts. A few days ago one of the out of staters called in and something was suggested - though last time we all went we decided we were not happy with the restaurant - but this is the one reservations were made at without my input. When I found out I assumed it was under consideration and nothing more but when I mentioned about it I was told ""I can't change it now, reservations are already made"". In past years it was Chinese, the first year I got very sick and it ruined my Christmas day. The next year we went back though I expressed a different opinion, ate a plate of rice and was treated like I was pouting because we went somewhere that I didn't suggest. 
Last year the guests visiting cooked food, something I wouldn't eat, and I made sure to have something for myself earlier in the day so that I wouldn't be left hungry while the others were eating. Sure, I'm a picky eater but it feels like my thoughts on any of this stuff are consistently dismissed and it hurts. I did suggest another restaurant this year but Mom insists we'll go there new years eve instead. Not the same thing. So we're stuck with a restaurant we don't really like but someone suggested it, so the visitors opinions seem to carry a little more weight. Traditionally for Christmas Eve, after dinner I'd set up Christmas movies. Polar Express, Home Alone, Christmas Vacation, etc., but it looks like this year I'll be setting them up earlier. I've decided to keep quiet on the restaurant choice and will, at the last minute, mention that I won't be joining them rather than saying anything now and a reservation changed to accommodate me. They had their chance before making the reservations and didn't ask me anything about it, so it's not something that would upset me now. My input didn't ever seem to be considered and while it hurts and I've said as much to family, I don't want my Christmas ruined by people expecting me to go along with something I didn't agree to. I've done enough compromises for past holidays that it didn't seem like such a bad thing to suggest something EVERYONE could enjoy, yet it was still rejected. I'm going to enjoy the rest of the year, these next 13 days leading up to Christmas Eve and just get my mind in a better place and not worry about someone being upset that I may refuse to go along just because they're family. Has anyone else been in a situation like this where even if you suggest something everyone likes that it still is avoided? ",depression
A Upward Time,"An update on a past post.  I have some up and down times with trying to deal with caring and being around my Mom, today I learned to deal with her.  She likes to be right and the boss.  Someone suggested, speak to her indirectly.  Another words, get her to come to the conclusion herself your trying to get her to do or get across.  It seemed to work.  I thought it might help someone else in a similar situation.  And to let anyone interested it's a better day for me personally.",depression

Mel Robbins.....love her,Just watched a clip on YouTube.. Mel Robbins talking about how people turn to opiates and drugs to cope with trauma or emotional issues. Nothing makes me feel more apart of this world and hopeful for society to hear im not alone. My story is not unique. Its not just me. So many people have been through this. So many people have found the way out.. This womans story broke me down to tears. Its beautiful to see people with my story overcoming so much.  I think about all the people trying to find their way out and mostly the ones that couldnt find their way out...And I feel its my duty..my obligation to keep at this. I keep going for them. I keep going for my daughter that passed away. And I keep going for my inner child.. I care for her the way nobody else would. Give her the love and attention she needed so she can rest now.,depression
Bizarre messages from daily strength,I keep getting notifications about journals that friends wrote -months ago. It gives impression that a journal was just written but that's not the case. Usually months old. Very annoying,depression
M.I.A,"Haven't really been on here in awhile. I guess you can say I'm putting my ""depressive energy"" into things that will make a difference one day I guess. I'm almost finished with my first semester of school and it's going well. I have a two week vacay before the next semester starts. Hopefully good news comes about from my grandmother who is hospitalized. But if I'm honest, if God was to take her, I would be okay with that. It would be different without her. Is it wrong for me to say that I hope that is God's plan because I know my grandmother is tired of suffering and tired of living in her condition and situation? I mean this in a genuine way. I know my aunt wants me to pray and ask God to bring her back, but if He's not going to heal her completely, I rather Him take her. I just pray that she is saved and she gets to meet Jesus. It's weird that I'm ok with it. I guess you can say that the death of my father has taught me how to let go. I really wanted my dad to be here but God had other plans and so did my dad. So whatever my grandma wants, I'm ok with it. The crazy thing is God will do the opposite of what I'm saying to show me who's in control. He has a funny way of proving things to me.",depression
I'm suffering so much,"These past few days have neen hell for me. I can barely leave bed and I can't sleep very well. It's like I don'y have the energy to move, yet I can't even sleep to recover my energy. The smallest tasks are so difficult. I even skipped work a few days. I've skipped work so much I think I'm getting fired soon. I've also been on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication for months, they worked a bit during the first few weeks, but now it's like they don't work anymore. I feel like I don't want to continue living. ",depression
life is going nowhere,"i haven't posted on this website in ages and finally logged back on because i have nowhere else to turn before the hospital (again) and don't want to have to force myself to go to a therapist, even though i know that i really need to.
i'm a full time college student, work 2 jobs, have an amazing, nearly 3 year long relationship with my boyfriend. he just finished undergraduate school and his official graduation is in another week. he also is about to commission for the U.S. army, and will be moving back to his home state where his base will be as well as the new job he just got outside of the military. to put that into perspective, i live in florida and he's moving back home to virginia in about another week and a half.
we've done distance before so that isn't the part that i'm worried about. what's giving me the discomfort is not knowing when i'll get to visit with him. we've talked about it half a dozen times and we know our relationship itself is going to be fine, it's just the being apart part of it is gonna be a challenge and will make me feel even more alone knowing i can't get up and drive an hour to see him like i normally can.
anyways... my grades and classes for this past semester that are closing out were a joke. i work so much and haven't been truly happy with myself financially, physically, emotionally, academically, or as a friend, girlfriend, daughter, or anything of the sort. i feel like i work so hard and that it's all for nothing. that my life is becoming a joke and that no matter what i do, it's not enough. i feel defeated.
constantly being in pain is another thing and that's for a personal reason, but being in physical pain everyday of my life and having to work to earn money and push through it is also shortening my patience for my success.
i like to constantly have company and not be alone because when i am, i think irrationally and overthink, and it eventually leads to me wanting to ignore anyone and everyone. it will also usually result in a panic attack and me crying myself to sleep.
i know that i need to see a therapist. i know i do. but just like everything else i know i need to do, want to do to better myself or just want to get done, the drive is there but the motivation to get up and do it or get it done is what's missing. and that's where my depression is hitting me harder than it ever has.
i used to self harm but haven't in a couple of years. it's always that option that's on the back burner, but i don't do it because it's temporary relief to an in-the-moment issue.
i don't know what to do or where to go from here.",depression
Edema,"I have noticed that my ankles are getting puffy. I am depressed. Dunno. I decided to get 15 mins of exercise. I hope that the edema is only tempoary and not a huge health consern. I also have another health issue. Its more of a pain. It is kinda TMI. So I won't type about it. 
I see the doctor on the 24th lol Christmas Eve! haha. Its amazing he is seeing people on that day. I guess so. The website let me book that day. 
I have been eating salads mostly. I am just in a depressive state. I owe $3000 to the hospital for day group therapy. I owe money for other things too. I think a combined sum of $5000. Currently unemployed. Looking for a job. No one responds to my applications. I pay minium payments. My parents are helping me out a bit. Giving me $150 every so often. It is what it is. 
I don't need health issues right now. I did give up drinking beer. I am taking Depokte for my BP1. So that will mess with your liver. I don't need that either. I drink lots of water. 
I am either drinking water, black coffee or tea. Very rarely I have a few beers. I never drink hard alcohol.

I called my grandma up to vent, and she said, ""Why don't you ask your parents for money?"" I told her a) that's not how I am, and b) even if it were, they can't give me enough to help me through the month. I've been applying for more lucrative jobs. No idea if I'll get one though.

This is me,"I guess i will start here .... where it all became a landslide . I was doing great , life was good couldnt get any better . I was battling anxiety bad , real bad before things became bad. Than i lost my job , i fell in depression . My fiance was there but he couldn't understand what i was feeling. I even felt like there was times he didnt want to , none of it is his fault i understand that . I was lost and kept telling myself , its just a job not the end of the world you'' find one , you'll make it . That was in June , then one month went by , then two , then three , then four and depression kept sneaking around the corner . I guess it will be easier if i had family but my fiance is all i have and he is there for me but when you are dealing with these kind of things noone but someone who is going through the same thing can make sense of this . Everyone i know is moving with there life even my fiance , he walks out the door for work , come back and do it all over again the next which is normal right ? but im standing still stuck and alone . I never thought i would be dealing with this but im not sure how long i can hang in there. I cry everyday, some days i dont want to get up , i have been ignoring people not out of being mean but for the sake of breaking down. i have had instances of which ive wanted to commit suicide , but there's something that takes me from it . I havent felt like myself in 5 months and sometimes im scared of myself . I pray and hope , there will be and end and happy part of this .

Feeling crappy (may trigger ED),"I'm writing on here 'cause I feel crappy and I don't know who to talk to. Normally I'd talk to my bf but he's working. I've been feeling really bad about myself. I currently weigh the most I ever have in my life. I'm at 164 pounds and I'm a fairly short woman. It feels weird calling myself a woman I still feel like a stupid kid. I cry sometimes when I look at myself. I feel fat and ugly and worthless. Others tell me nice and positive things but I know I'm not as attractive as I used to be. I find myself wishing I could safely starve until it goes away but I know I can't do that. It's hard finding time and money to be healthier. I hate myself. I wish I could be more like someone else. My mom never wants to hear me talk about this stuff, she cuts it off. I just want to be pretty and happy and normal. I'm just an ugly, fat, zombie. With how out of it I always am I feel like I am barely a person. I find myself staring off into space, I may as well not move unless I have to.

How to ask for help when you feel like a burden,"I live alone in a big city. All my family lives further away in the country and knows I deal with anxiety and borderline depression.

I've been really struggling and wanting to talk to one of them, but every time I get a chance they have something going on in their lives that they want help with and I always just listen to their struggles. Every time I ask it's 'never the right time' for them to just listen. How do I ask the right way and feel less burdensome ",depression
Just Done,"After 4 years of being in denial about how I feel, telling myself that I'll just get over it, I'm admitting to myself that I might have depression.

But ai cant help but think that it wont happen for me, I've coasted through High school and university, and now I feel like it's all just gone to waste. Every morning I wake up and have to spend a few minutes convincing myself there's even a point to getting out of bed. I've got no social life, no real career prospects and nothing that I excel at that could even be a direction to go in. I just feel stuck, like there is no point to anything I do anymor. I wouldnt ever consider suicide or anything like that, but it's getting to the place where I wish I could just go to sleep and stay that way.",depression
This is crushing me,"Hi, I'm new here, feeling a little nervous. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and anorexia, and I also self harm.

I never want to get up and face the day, I hate going to bed because I know the next thing I know will be pain about getting up. My job is very high energy, so being down in the dumps isn't an option. I've never had a crisis like this before, where I just want to stop caring for myself and for others because it hurts too much.

"Depressed, stressed","I woke up this morning feeling very down and stressed out.  I am trapped in a horrific family situation.  I just cannot get myself out of it.  I don't know who to contact to get help with my mother.  My therapist and doctor are awful and will not help when i have brought this up.  Mom is physically and mentally unable to take care of herself.  I am so tired from working and my own health problems that I don't even have time to deal with this.  I feel like I have acid inside me all the time.  My family is so dysfunctional and abusive towards me. The more I learn about it and what is actually going on in my family and how negative it is for me, the worse it makes it for me because i am learning more and more about how selfish and awful they are and have been towards me and that I was this do gooding fool who didn't see it and now i am so deep into it i can't get out.  I don't want to sacrifice my mom but it has come to that to save myself.  i thought i could handle this but i can't.  it's not fair to me either, even if i could handle it.  I think my mother is a covert narcissist also which i didn't realized until recently and that really freaks me out too.  becoming aware and more enlightened really has a down side.  you can lose your whole family.  i feel so effing ill.  i have to go to the store now and buy stuff for me and her.  she is completely financially destitute and she is pulling me into financial and emotional ruin also while at the same time taking no responsibility for it.  just like my sister, really.  it's sickening to me.  i feel totally alone and i'm stuck, i know i always say the same sh-t.  i'm like a broken record.  sometimes you are just too down and tired and low to pull yourself out when you have all these forces working against you.  my family is not willing to meet me half way or even a quarter of the way.  they would instead rather sacrifice me than grow up and take responsibility. what do you do about that?",depression
Giving up,"I guess i will start from the beginning. I have 3 wonderful kids. They are older now but still so young in my eyes. Anyway when i was married to their dad i took care of everything. I paid the bills took care of the house and kids worked. His money was his for the first 4 years. I put him though school and he was supposed to do the same for me when he was done. When i was at work and he was home the kids still went to daycare. He really did nothing. When he graduated he wanted to move to his parents halfway across to country. We did. I wasnt able to go to school. His mom was a mean person. She accused me of being lazy. Not jeeping a clean home and would throw water in my youngest daughters fase for crying. She was less then 2 years old at the time. And this is only a very little of what would happen. My other 2 kids where treated badly as well. I begged their dad to make it stop. Even tried to leave. But he had moved me to a state i didnt know anyone and had no support. I developed a panic disorder. My parents convinced him to bring me home. That is when he found that the issue was his mom. He didnt like that so he started accusing my parents of the same. He moved me again to his sister. Same crap different face. And then his sisters kids. Mind you they are all my age or older. His sister is 20 years older then him. Anyway the doctors put me in 3 anti-anxiety meds and topped me out on 3 different antidepressants. If i wasnt sleeping i wasnt a real person. I almost successfully committed suicide on one of the 3 occasions I tried. One day something snapped in me and a saw what i was doing to my kids with the neglect. And their dad was always on the computer so they didnt really have parents anymore. So i stopped taking the meds and told him that if he didnt change with me i was leaving. It took me 2 years to get off all the meds without killing my self. The doctors wouldnt help and my ex hated the i wanted off. So in 2 years he took the opportunity to convince our son the i was abusing him. Now with the neglect its true. But really i dont remember much of thus time so i dont know. My oldest daughter faught tooth and nail saying it wants true only neglect. My kids all came with me when i left. I fot my son into counselling but i had to let him live with his dad because at 13 already my size he would punch and kick me for making him get off the game to eat dinner. So i lost my son at 13. My oldest is 5 years older and was adamant that i had never abused them. Then ine day she met a man and got pregnant i told her this was a bad situation for her. Me current husband told her the same. He drinks cheats and has punched the wall next to her head. This is when she said i abused her. And now im not allowed to see my grandson. My youngest is now 15 and her only sibling that calls her is her brother. And only after i made him realize what this abandonment is doing to her. Now all of a sodden she is saying the same thing. I abused her. I asked her when and she brings up the past neglice. I tell her that has been over for 8 years and i have tried to make up for that everyday of the last 8 years. But she going to live with her dad that only calls her every 2 or 3 months and has never done anything for her. My current husband says we will get through this together but i dont know if i can believe him as he cheeted on my 2 years ago only 1 year after we married for more than 6 months with his ex girlfriend from childhood. Yes he has made a lot of change since then and tried to make things right. But after everything that has happened in the last 14 years how do i believe? I have been begging God to just let me have a heart attack and die. I found out a couple weekes ago that i have a heart condition due to stress. Even my parents believe that im just a bad person. Im not allowed to talk with them without getting yelled at for involving them in my ""crap"". I just want to give up. I could run. But how do you run frim the pain? So hear i am. HOPPING.",depression

My heart hurts,"I started yesterday feeling happy and ended the day going to sleep pissed, very sad, and crying. My daughter, son-in-law, and my two granddaughters (2 and 5) came over to put up my christmas decorations and bring me breakfast. This was the problem, my boyfriend of 3 years usually gets McDonalds breakfast for us. Saturday night they were predicting snow here so he said to me he won't get us breakfast if it bad outside. Sunday morning comes and he comes in  and tells me was goingas no snow so  breakfast on. I called 2 minutes after he left  and said forget it my daughter is coming and bringing breakfast. I did not invite him. He told me he doesn't like my daughter - the way she treats her kids - and the kids are kids so it drives him batty (he has two daughters 22, 23 that never talk to him I wonder why)! I live in a 55+ complex and he lives in the apartment across the way. He told me not to take it personally if he doesn't come over whent hey are here. This was before but yesterday I should have thought of him. WTF!  I'M CONFUSED!!! He texts me last night that not coming here so had my aide that cares for me make me dinner and ate alone. He's here tonight and  said might leave and owe him an apology. I did not apologize as feel I did not  do anything wrong. I'm 63, was married 30 years when needed to use a wheelchair so my then husband wanted a divorce, I swore to myself that I WILL NEVER let a man run my life.

Cant take it anymore.,"I've struggled with Bipolar depression since my late teens (I just turned 30) I struggled with PPD after my son was born in 2016. *he was premature too. And I had him at 32 weeks and he spent 2 weeks in the nicu* I spent 7 weeks in the hospital trying to prevent another premature birth but had my daughter at 35 weeks, they told me she would probably only be in the NICU for a few hours maybe a day or two. Today Marks day 21 in the NICU :(
her discharge date has changed 4 times now. I just cant do it anymore. I've been away from my son for almost 3 months. It's so damn hard :( I finally came home today to stay home my husband is going back. I just cant emotionally handle it anymore. I wasnt sleeping or eating or wanting to bathe. I feel angry at the nurses all the time because it feels like they are giving me false hope only to have it ripped away again :(
I feel horrible, I feel like I failed her by not being able to make it to full term, and I now I feel like I'm failing her again because I just want her home and feel so helpless in getting her home. She has successfully completed her feedings. Done her hearing test and heart screening and passed her carseat test but now she is starting to have bradycardia episodes and they dont know why 
I called a little bit after 7pm and she has been doing good on her feedings since I left, and has maintained her body tempature and hasn't had anymore bradycardia episodes. She has to go 72 hours without any, I hope she is home this week, she is already 3 weeks old today. ",depression

I am applying for even these jobs that requre 1 year experience. Hell, I just want health insurance..they can pay me what the fuck ever. As long as my commute does not put me at a disavantage. Or if its a remote job, even better. 
So having zero, zilth, nada, bubkis feedback in that areana. Fine. I don't have a girlfriend. Ok theres that. Fine. So at least I figure I can get a job that I totally don't despise right? WTF?

Anyhoo. Just frustrated. Still applying and my resume mysterously ends up in the black hole. WTF? I am doing nation wide remote job searches. Having scammers try and get my bank account info. So adding these scammers to the mix, is like rubbing salt into my wounds.

And I believe something could, but it's hard to know how it's going to happen when depression has me on emotional rollercoasters and I don't hjave any real connects. And its not just about reaching people either. This is how I will be able to take care of myself.

You are not alone,I just typed a long post about a traumatic experience i had and accidently deleted it. I will take it as a sign that my story is not yet complete. That maybe there is a happier ending I have yet to find. I would love to use my painful past to help people with their current reality.  But maybe I dont have a happy ending to offer yet. I do want to say this. That pain is pain. It doesnt matter if your depressed over nothing or depressed from a traumatic experience. Having a reason to be sad feels the exact same way as having no reason to be sad. If anything its harder for other people to take you seriously when you dont have a reason to be sad. Those are the people that truly struggle in my opinion. Feeling bad for feeling bad isnt fair to anyone. You matter. Your feelings matter. And even if nobody around you understands. Remember... I understand. And an entire community of people understand. They say 1 in 4 people suffer from a mental illness. You arent alone. We are not alone. ,depression

"An ""off"" feeling - looking for some advice","Hey everyone, I'm new here. I'm a little nervous to post, but I'm hoping for some advice. I'm nineteen and for the past year or so I've felt like something is ""off"". I can't really put my finger on it. I've felt increasingly lonely and isolated, and pretty lost as to where I want to go in my future. I frequently feel like I ""zone out"" during the day and I'm just going through the motions. I struggle to engage in any kind of meaningful conversation with other people.
I've had some episodes where I've become panicked and overwhelmed to the point where I had to step aside and take a while alone to collect myself. It's happened when I saw a career counselor, after work, when I went out with some coworkers for dinner, and once it just seemed to happen out of nowhere. I'm not sure what the cause of this is. I've always been a shy person, and so some of them I just chalked up to me being nervous about talking to people, but some of them didn't seem to have any kind of reason behind them.
Over the past couple of years, I've had a few periods where I became physically ill almost every morning and would dry heave. I ate a lot less and it was hard to stomach any large amounts of food. It wasn't that I was punishing myself by not eating or anything like that, it's just that the act of eating food made me feel sick. I did go in to see a doctor about this issue. They ran some tests but couldn't find anything really wrong with me. They prescribed me some allergy medication because they theorized that overnight my nose was draining into my stomach and disrupting it. I took the medication for a while, but it didn't seem to do much and when the symptoms went away, I stopped using it. It seems like it comes and goes periodically.
I'm not sure if the dry heaving and loss of appetite could be psychosomatic. I've heard of depression or anxiety making people puke if it's really bad, but that doesn't seem to fit me. I still function on a day-to-day basis. I make it out of bed, I get my schoolwork done and get to work every day. Overall I feel like I'm able to manage my responsibilities okay, I'm just not fully engaging with other people and I feel like I'm dragging myself through a lot of days.
I have not seen a phyciatrist or been diagnosed with any kind of mood disorder, but depression and anxiety both run in my family. I don't want to self-diagnose, but something feels wrong with me and I can't figure out what. Other than the dry heaving (which I still can't figure out) are my feelings pretty normal coming-of-age kind of stuff? Should I consider seeing a physciatrist? I don't really want to because it seems like it'd just be one more thing on my plate, but do you think this ""off"" feeling needs attention or will simply go away with time? And does this sound like depression or something else?

"Struggling, pointless.","I'm struggling so much, I'm angry and irritable almost all of the time.

Anyone want a friend?,"Hello,
I just thought it might be nice to extend an invitation to talk with me. In particular if you have any poetry/writing/photography you would like to share then we could exchange work. It can be nice to be vulnerable and share something you have created because in a sense you are sharing yourself with that person. We can also share music/youtube videos because that is the kind of thing that makes me happy and if you agree then let us cheer each other up :) Although it helps to talk about our problems, sometimes it is nice to put them to the side and try to find a bit of happiness. 
Note: I can't promise I'll be talkative to everyone, sometimes I just don't get along with certain people or they make me uncomfortable but hey, it's worth trying because we might just get along great. Other times I am just not in a good headspace to talk because of my own mental illnesses but I'd let you know if that is the case and get back to you later. Also if I somehow get too many requests I might not be able to talk to everyone. Lastly, I can't talk to anyone who is majorly depressed (unless you plan on hiding it), a little bit of depression is okay because obviously I am posting this under the depression section but try to limit how much you share with me because that tends to make me even more depressed. My goal is to cheer you up.

what is worse than depression?,"Let me tell you, as I see it: what is worse than depression?
What is worse than waking up every day to the same hole in one's chest, where the heart used to be?
What is worse than having good memories come into your head, especially when you don't want them?
What is worse than being alone, needing a hug, a kiss, a possible ""I love you...""
You'd think depression is worse than those things, and you would be totally right.
The feeling of: ""ok, a gun shot would hurt, only for a second, and is loud and besides you don't have one and can't buy one..."" the thought, ""yeah poison might work, but you don't know what one is the best and you don't just wanna get sick,"" or a multitude of thoughts on the how to...flood your brain.  These are all bad thoughts, evil ones indeed.
What is worse than all that?
The same old thing, used by thousands of people, after the fact: I would'ah, if I could'ah...so I should'ah...even a person, like myself, who has helped others, when I was an alcohol-drug counselor, deal with that shit...now I have nobody and the worse of it...nobody, not even family give a fuck.
The depressive thought: I should have stayed...and just faught it all, done my best to do something to get my-wife back.

Thanksgiving nightmare,"The hatred I feel for my family today is intense.  This is supposed to be a family day for giving thanks for family, etc. and i just feel absolute hatred for them.  Maybe there is something wrong with me.  Maybe i just need to be gone.  My mother and i got into a fight about my siblings.  again.  my mother was saying how my narc sister and rotten lousy brother are only human and she doesn't want to give up on the and that i was being to harsh.  she tried to tell me i was at fault.  i blew up.  the lot of them are horrific and crazy.  i mean really..  i can't get my mom out of my house.  i literally don't have the money or free time to do it.  today i thought i blowing off my head with a shotgun just to get away from them.  the crazy. fucks.  it's hard when you start to get mentally healthier or at least see the dysfunctional patterns of your family in a more clear light and the other people are have not progressed.  i am not saying i am mentally healthy but i am not as sick as they are.  i hate my mother for not caring about how much damage my family has caused me.  she is so crazy.  i hate her.  i hate my father.  i hate my brother and i hate my sister. selfish evil horrible monsters.  the only thing i can do is physically remove myself from them and i can't even do that because my mom is in the house.  she's like dead weight.  dhe just sits in there and expects me to do everything for her and if i don't she won't.  she'll just sit there in her own filth.  lazy bitch.  i told her she needed to go to assisted living today and she said no, she wanted to go home and live in a house where she has no family around, can't wash herself or shop or pay the bills.  when i reminded her of this she said ""I have nowhere else to go""  i told her she needed to be evaulated by a social worker.  she glared and me.

Sometimes I've Been Feeling Hopeless,"Hello, I just wanted to make this post because sometimes I have been feeling a sense of hopelessness within this world. I feel like no matter what when it comes to the classes I am taking in college that I am not going to pass any of them. Also, that I would not be able to have any friends at all during my college life and that no one is going to end up respecting or caring about me.",depression
Feeling Displaced - Like This Isn't My World,"For me depression comes and goes along with all the things people are supposed to feel depressed about. So I don't see depression as a problem in and of itself. In other words I don't think I suffer from some bio-chemical condition not triggered by typical external events that cause people to feel sad in some way. Depression is just a part of life that I as a living feeling being deal with, and because I'm more analytical than most of the people I know, I notice things that disturb me more often than others.
Was it Hemmingway who said something like: Happiness in intelligent people is one of the rarest things I know."" I tend to resonate with that and simply say: ""Happiness is overrated."" It's through our failures and dissapointments as much as our successes and joy that we learn the value of our acheivements, and how to become better people.
Now having said all that, I've experienced another nagging feeling most of my life, and I'm wondering if it's something that proffesionals might class as a form of depression. If not, what exactly is it?. It's a bit difficult to describe, but it's as if I'm not living in the world I'm supposed to be in. There are a bunch of factors that add-up to this feeling, but there's no one thing I can put my finger on. It's perhaps best expressed by the character Morpheus in the sci-fi- movie The Matrix:
Mopheus To Neo:
""You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life; that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is. But it's there; like a splinter in your mind; driving you mad ... it's everywhere. It's all around us; even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth ...""
Whatever this reality or construct happens to be. It doesn't feel like my home. When I was about 12 years old, two friends and I walked through what paranormal researchers call a dimensional portal. We came here. One friend remembers something strange happening but attributes it to sleep deprivation. I don't. Things changed subtly but in ways that cannot be explained any other way. Since then, I've had a number of other paranormal experiences. I know how it sounds, but I can't be the only one that this has happened to.
Has anyone else experienced something similar? Can we ever get home?",depression
Conversation,"It's not even because of the holidays, it's not because I'm lonely because I'm not. I wish I had an actual friend who I could hangout with, talk to, and be able to really be myself with. I believe you can't be yourself with everybody because everybody doesn't deserve it or wouldn't even appreciate it. I want actual, healthy relationships with people and from people who want the same thing. No more halfassing myself because people in this generation is scared of true intimacy and vulnerablity. I want real love, from friends, from family, and from a siginificant other. But until then, I focus on myself because nobody is going to give me the healing, affection, and love that I need.

Well I met with the nurse practitioner and the doctor today and they advised that wont be happening.  They informed me that after she finishes all 8 bottles they watch her for the next 24-48 hours to make sure she keeps up with her feeds. They do it to make sure she doesnt ware herself out and stop feeding, I understand it and I get it. They want to prevent a readmission. What makes me mad and upset me is the nurse from yesterday said nothing of this sort and made it seem like as long as she did those things today she would come home tonight.  I am not leaving her until she does. She has taken every single full bottle since I've been here, there has been no tube feeding at all.  Keep your fingers crossed she comes home by friday.

Rock Bottom,"I am finding it very difficult to speak in person about my true issues, but I hope that I can explain myself in this letter.

From a young age, I was always told to push down on my emotions. My dad, along with other male figureheads in my life, always told me that 'emotions are for girls and for sissies' and therefore I'd be a girl if I let myself show any emotion. To this date, this ethos has stuck in my head and, even now, I try to ignore my true emotions and just put on a brave face while really on the inside I am screaming and crying out for help.

I am suffering with severe depression and severe anxiety - my last scoring showed me as a 24 for depression (the only reason I didn't get 'the jackpot 27' is because I am not self-harming) and a 17 for anxiety. This means operating on a day to day basis has been very difficult for me. My body's natural response at the moment to anything negative is to either try to run or to freeze, and I have been trying so hard to suppress these feelings that it has caused a hormonal imbalance in my system. This has displayed itself with physical symptoms, like severe headaches, panic attacks and, from medical advice I have received, can be the cause of picking up certain viral infections and other issues. ​Hiding these 'flight or freeze' emotions also goes back to childhood, and my dad's voice screaming at me to not show emotion. It's a constant battle inside my own head which I, unfortunately, have been losing.

What I currently face is a constant battle to sleep, a fluctuating mood with respect to food, diet, exercise and the likes, and I literally have to force myself to walk outside the door of my house just to actually do any of my normal day-to-day routine. I have hit an all time low.

I am now looking at trying to open up and wondered if anyone had any advice or information they found useful in moving forward? I have officially hit rock bottom and I want to improve.

"if it isn't memories of my ""wife"" it's Social Secu","I have written at least five letters to her, unsure which one will get them: will it be my-wife or will it be the protector? I guess, in a way it does not matter which one gets them, but if it is the protector, I'm pretty sure they end up in the oval file before they're even opened. This takes into account that the SS Guard (jr Gestapo Bitch), ""the landlady"" (long time friends of my-wife doesn't take the letters and tosses them, just for the hell of it.  SS Guard and her P**ckhead son, they knew her a while back, the first time my-wife had this issue happen---and they could not see any difference in her.  Stupid, uneducated, people, or maybe they just don't understand anything.  Anyway SS Guard thinks she can ""control"" her, which is a laugh, the protector won't let anybody control her and she's a damn good faker, even if she is part of the whole delusion.
So I have absolutely no money.  Long story as to why that came to be, especially since I was supposed to have some coming in each month. That didn't happen, thanks to the protector.
As if my life isn't crap already: no money, can't buy my cigars, can't get online much, no friends, can't find friends, can find a job, can't get SSI right now...can't can't can't...with a don't tossed in there like an unwanted rotten tomato slice.  I don't even have a lady friend to have a conversation with, or hang out with or be intimate with.  It's just all bullshit.
Every morning is the exact same as the previous, well, ok, close enough. I once used the plot of Groundhog Day...you know, where Bill Murray's character wakes up every morning to the same day?  Well I'm not as lucky as that character, at least he has adventures every day and gets a chance to learn something and in the end, it turns out all cool, he's learned the lessons, became enlightened and also wins the woman.
Why not me?
Slammed at least three times a week.  It's like a solid ""no"" as a wall.  I was on Youtube not long ago, came across Quiet Riot song, I liked that band, even though I'm more into rock...their song Bang Your Head...yeah, I bang my head, but not for pleasure or enjoyment and it's not me that wants to do it.  I finally get maybe a step or two ahead and then, a wall, and I bang my head.
Most recent is this one: a few years back, I went into the local Social Security office to apply for disability. I didn't qualify because I miss one credit (basically equals a month 1/2 or two months of work)...so I decided to go for my SSI. The rude SocSec woman then, without telling us squat about it, ""combined"" us to my wife's case.  That was a big mistake.  We didn't know what it was all about and dummy us, we just bought into it.
Anyway, so I go into the local office. The guy says I can't do it cuz I am still on her case. I say ""remove me,"" and he looks at me as if I am suggesting I want to have my way with his sister...he tells me I can't do ""shit""...leaving that word as a near-silent hiss.
Seems like the only person who can remove me from my wife's case is my wife.  But who and where is my wife?  I don't know. I know where she lives, where we used to live.  So I wrote five letters, each one with something on the outside, telling her what it was about and please read.  I don't know if she read them.
So F...here I am, deserving to have a life and not just to survive it. I deserve my SSI, I put, no, SS taxes were removed from my pay for the time I worked, so I'd have it when I needed it.  But if you haven't noticed, SSA fights everybody, it's our F'n money, why should we have to fight for it, when we need it? Stupid, god-like meglomaniac government agency. I wonder if their own workers have to fight to get their disability or SSI?  Would be poetic justice.
Now I have to find an attorney. I thought I had, but I didn't. How much harder will it make it, if they have to send an official letter to tell her to go to the local office and remove me?  That is the only way she will do it, getting an official letter.  No wait, divorce.
I have issues about divorcing her...I mean which one will it be, that I am divorcing?
I'd prefer her to divorce me, well, not really, but it is obvious, right?
I need an F'n attorney who is honest, trustworthy and isn't some dumbass who won't return calls. I need one who looks at this case and says, ""Yeah, I can do that..."" I mean, there isn't even a big issue about this, just send an official letter, tell her she needs to remove me, give her a time limit.  If she doesn't do it within that time, then we have a bang-your-head moment...but can be taken care of by the attorney.
I am tired of banging my head, I'd rather bang something---someone---else. lol
Ah come'on, the only fun, the only pleasure I have left, which drags me out of all the depression, etc is my ""pervert"" attitude and thoughts of a better day (or night)...give me a break and if you are in the Houston area, got any suggestions on an attorney who has balls, even if it is a woman attorney?

"hate, shame, hopeless","Morning to fellow aussies and gday to the rest of you worldly people.
I have been thinking lately of my insecurities and the issues I have and where they may have stemmed from and I realised that up till I was maybe 10 I had no issues with the physical appearance of my body. After hitting puberty early (roughly 10 or 11yrs old) and amoung the first to hit such a milestone in my school things went south quickly. I became very sexual very young (not having sex that young but omg the urges were strong even then) and the strong emotions that come with puberty confused me. I guess I didn't feel like I had friends back then too since I didn't confide in anyone about my thoughts and emotions, but I wish something like this forum was around so I could've had someone else relate but we're talking roughly 18 years ago now so computers were still relatively young technology. So back to my point; I have figured that my internal struggle with self acceptance and love has come from that time. I was picked on strongly for my looks (I am hairy but back in those days it was fine white hair and thanks to listening to the bullies I have shaved my arms, belly and legs since year 6 and now it's all thick black hair that constantly needs removal due to being noticeable). I was laughed at for having a crush on the popular boy who used to live behind me and we would spend time together as friends and pretty much made to feel not good enough for his friendship let alone anything more. I was never noticeably someone's first choice always the second or third if better people were taken. The list goes on I suppose. 
now I'm not ugly (I dont think so), I'm roughly 160cm tall, I have curves and sometimes when particularly depressed even rolls, my nose is straight and strong (hahaha it doesn't even lift bro) my lips could probably do with filling but they aren't horrible and my eyes are my favourite feature but I  hate how I look and how I feel in my own skin. I look at other women (not even lingerie pics just women in full clothing) and see their smooth skin, healthy complexions, hair, nails, clothing and I am filled with self loathing and jealousy. I went through a check out the other day and a lovely young girl was serving me she couldn't have been more then 20 (I'm 27) and I just thought "" I bet my partner would rather her then me"" and I just spiralled down from there. He wasn't even with me to make me feel insecure but I realised I do it to myself and I can't help it, I hate my body, skin, complexion, my lack of motivation to get better everything about me I hate and I hate myself loathing the most, vicious circle. My lack of motivation comes from thinking that getting skinnier and moisturising daily won't change anything so why try? See how this crap is depressing and draining?!? My partner tries to make me feel better but knowing my partner fantasises about other women just makes his words useless to me because due to my insecurities I need someone who doesn't see anyone else in their head, I need to be someone's all just like they for me because I don't fantasise about other men unless it's completely unrealistic eg liam Hemsworth seeking me out and me turning him down due to real life things or similar it's never sexual though (we have discussed this so I do know it happens and I'm glad he was honest with me at least and I think it's a normal thing for people to do but it feeds my insecurities). I dunno I just needed to get this off my chest i suppose since I've been spiraling for a few days about it all. Ahh well. Much love peeps but I should actually do my cleaning ",depression
Anybody know where to get help?,"Im not far enough to need a crisis line, nor do I want the attention that brings,  but why does it have to get that far before anyone will help...  insurance doesn't cover it,  even if it did I don't want them knowing,  it's none of their business.  Maybe I don't know how to use Google but I find nothing available that I can afford.  I can't even find a support group on or off line",depression

Depression and family problems,"I'm a married 20 something who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for years. I'm finally realizing that the ""close family"" I thought I had as a child was was actually pretty dysfunctional and messed up. Both my sibling and I struggle with mental illness, and I don't think that's a coincidence... I think a lot of it was how we were raised.
My mom is very loud and overbearing and has made hurtful jokes/comments about me throughout my life. She makes fun of the fact that I'm sensitive and thinks I'm lazy because I sleep a lot (like many with depression do). The last time my husband and I went to visit, my mom saw me tear up and said, ""You're not going to CRY again are you?""  I've tried to explain to her calmly that her words hurt but whenever I confront her she just says, ""that's who I am."" As you can imagine, with that attitude she has very few friends. She is very volatile and would go from yelling at me one minute to telling me how much she loved me the next minute. It was so confusing to grow up like that... no wonder I worry all the time and feel so unstable. 
My dad is emotionally aloof and whenever I would tell him how depressed I was as a teenager, he would tell me to just ""try harder."" I lost a ton of weight when I was a teenager and I remember him taking one look at me and saying, matter-of-factly, ""you're starving."" It's like he didn't even care and he was just stating a fact, like I wasn't his daughter but some random person on the street. I'm married now and he recently told my husband, ""If you ever need anything, you can talk to me. It's really hard being around someone with depression."" This was so hurtful to me, because it makes me feel like even more of a burden. 
Does anyone have any similar experiences with dysfunctional families? How do you move past all the hurt and resentment? ",depression

Have I made any difference???,"Have I??
The other day at work, early in the morning a young woman approached me (part of my job is working outside) and said she had a dollar and wondered if she could buy some cigarettes off me. I knidly told her i didn't smoke and she excused herself politely and left. She was obviously i poor situations, worn clothes, quiet spoken, and weak spirit. It hurts to feel that from another just stuggling to survive today. but the horror was when the workers i call friends (well work friends) came over (as work had just barley started and they were getting out of thier vehicles) and mocked her. Saying 'what did the bear lady want?' It blew me over how insensative they were and made me realize does anyone care anymore? Does it matter if you do? None of these guys i work with are bad people, but just seem to be so ignorantly oblivious to a stangers pain. If i had still smoked, would it have made her day to receive a cigarette? i would have given her a couple freely, would it have made a difference?
Does it matter here? I mean isn't the goal to get better? then once you do...your gone. i don't mean that in a bad way, if a person can find some happiness and overcome. whats the point of staying here? Am i here to find some friends that the real world seems so absent of? You make connections talking to someone personally. you and they relate and you help each other, then there gone. Back to thier lives half way across the world or the states. I wonder if i said anything that actually helped or healed, if i made any difference? 
I really try and feel for each post, comment, and message i send. Not just some sympathy card quotation. I've met many here that we texted here, connected in similaraties and advice to help each other through bad times. A lot of them have moved on and i'm happy for them, happy they could overcome. But i wonder if i had anything to do with it or was just a voice in the dark, forgotten in the fog of time. Is it wrong to call someone here 'friend'? am i really your friend? even for a short while?
I can't be like my co-workers, i really just can't. But should I? should i grow a thicker skin and instead of showing compassion and sacrificing a couple dollars to help someone struggling should i invest it in myself? was that my biggest problem, giving too much to others and not enough to myself that brought me here? in wanting to help others so much, have i forgotten about myself?
Just another day. The bad things in my life are still bad, the good still good. I'll look to continue, write a little, draw a little, I'll alway try and make you smile or laugh, always try and help. It's just a part of me now.
I'll shake this of with this post, writting it helps as does time. Just some times i ask why.
Hoping that you all find happiness inside your hearts.  ",depression

need some feedback,"Hi,
I am having a concern and was wondering if ppl could give some objective feedback? It's not a depression issue per se, but it is confusing.
I got a new job which seems to be going ok and started to develop feelings and a crush on my supervisor.  I dealt with it by telling myself that it will pass and that he is attractive and a very nice man, but he is married and my supervisor, so I put it aside to the best of my ability and focused on my work.  I told myself with my rational mind, ""you will get over this, it's inappropriate and it will pass.""  I thought the whole thing was ""about me.""
I think I may have a problem, as I realized yesterday the feelings are not one-sided and I got some clarity. I can see how he feels about me and it scares me to death.  Scares me to death because I am intensely attracted to him and even when he gets close my heart races like crazy. I force myself to keep it together and just do what I am paid to do. I answer his questions and do the tasks that he wants (not well yet though cause I'm learning).  It sucks to struggle with the nerves but that's  the way it is.
Now I'm more worried because I realize what is actually happening-I am responding to the energy I am picking up from him.  I was going back and forth in my mind wracking my brain trying to figure out, ""why does he come to find the time to talk with me about stupid irrelevant garbage?"" It feels like he is flirting, and the other thing, he looks and looks and looks at me. Not watching like a supervisor, but he is taking me in and checking me out. In the manner in which men have pursued me before.  I thought, ""I'm going crazy, this is not happening, I am a silly girl (woman) who is lonely and needs attention."" But apparently I'm not the only one. I was minding my business yesterday and looked up and caught him pretty much fixated.  He was not attending to the task at hand as he was distracted by me! And when he saw me catch him, I could really see the guilt in his face. He knew he was caught and tried to hide his face and turn away but frankly he was busted. 
He's not creepy and he doesn't do anything inappropriate. He is very respectful and professional and not ""weird."" But I can see how he feels, now, which apparently he is trying to hide, just not well. I like him but I realize the ridiculousness of it. I don't understand. I would think if you are married/monogamous and in love, wouldn't you just not notice other people? I don't know. I suppose this could sound  narcissistic, whatever, it's what I saw and recognized though. I don't know him well, I just hope that one day he doesn't try to do something about it. If it were a different situation where he was NOT TAKEN and NOT my superior, I would love to be with someone as kind and sweet and beautiful as him. Basically I will be looking for these qualities in SOMEONE ELSE. But wtf am I going to do if he keeps this up and it gains momentum and he doesn't let it go and goes from looking and  thinking to acting on it? It will be very difficult, I have my own issues and fall under the sway of manipulative and attractive men easily. How will I maintain the boundary and not alienate him? I am not mad at him and I don't have bad feelings toward him, nor do I blame him just for thinking or feeling something, but if it turns into action on his part this could be a complicated mess. It seems silly for a supervisor to be infatuated with a subordinate, or obviously attracted to them, sorry, but true. ",depression
Deep Depression:(,"Since yesterday I have been extremely depressed and having someone to talk to would listen is difficult in my personal life.
This morning I focused on staying relaxed because I knew what was coming with depression. Despite trying to delay depression it is slowly creeping in for another full-blown day.
I will have to make another doctors appointment this morning for antidepressants. 
This morning, I got out of bed to refill a glass of water then went straight back to bed not being able to face the world. 
I don't get joy from life except for sadness. Surely if I do not participate in sadness things cannot get worse? I keep telling myself. 
Everything I am trying to achieve is going in the opposite direction. I am losing a battle the more I try to push forward.
Depression takes away everything including opportunities. I was due to study but cannot face people because the last few times I became emotional. 
Can anyone relate to me?
It will be great to not feel on my own.

Why does it hurt so much,"Why does love hurt so much? I'm 20 years old and live with my mom. I never want to leave her. I will only leave if she wants me to leave or if something else comes up as if I get married.
I know this must be a human thing. but why is love so wonderful but so painful. I love my mom so much it physically hurts. I would do anything for my mom and my older sister and my close friends I love. 
In psychology class we learn about mood disorders. I have been diagnosed with depression and I take medication for it and many times the medication doesn't even work. The therapist I used to meet with agreed with me that I might have bipolar disorder. I feel like I might be bipolar because my emotions are too strong. but then again I'm not really sure if I do because in my psychology book I don't really have the symptoms it says for bipolar. It's just I'm so tired of having very strong emotions and I'm super sensitive and it can be hard to be in school. It's just when I get upset it's like the end of the world and when im happy it's like the best day of my life and all I want to do is crazy stuff and run and sing and dance in the streets. and just go wild. It's hard to control. I know I shouldn't go too wild and I try to control it but sometimes I really just want to steal things and feel that adrenaline rush. All this crazy stuff I never imagine myself doing like stealing or something like that. it's just to hard to control my emotions. why must they be so strong and aggressive?
anyway, that's all. I feel like I kinda vented a lot, I don't really know what I'm talking about anymore.",depression
Family Challenges,"I think the bible has some instructive words for dealing with parents.  Sometimes they can be difficult or irrational.  I like the words Honor Your Parents.  It does not mean follow, obey, or agree.  It means a reasonable amount of respect and self-control, but you can also maintain your own beliefs.  So if you're a woman and your mother makes a comment about weight, you can listen, graciously say I am going to go in a couple of minutes and will call later.  You try to control your emotions, do not attempt to remake her, but also do not feel compelled to take abusive words, or let her dictate how you feel.   ",depression
I have a daughter!,"Hello everyone! Well it took a while, but it was all worth it. As most know I was induced Friday due to pregnancy complications,  on 11-10-19 @345pm I delivered my daughter Bella Marie.  She is 4lbs 7oz oz and 17 inches long! They attempted to induce once, it failed so they had to try again. Needless to say it was a rather rough labor, however once I started to go through the process and having consistent contractions it wasnt as bad as my first. 

She is doing extremely well, she is in the NICU but we were hoping it's not for long. She is breathing on her own, she is on the CPAP for a little lung support but other than that she is doing amazing. 
We are going to try feeding tomorrow. She may get discharged before me, I'm hoping we are all home by this weekend.

Need someone to write me please,"I cannot handle this anymore.  I am starting to go no contact with my horrific sister even though my mom is staying with me.  I also and finally at the point where I am going to kick my mom out of my house.  It is really sad.  These people are absolutely toxic to me.  I am extrememly upset tonight.  How in the hell did I wind up with such an evil family?  My mother is elderly and will not last long on her own.  they have sucked me dry financially, emotionally, physically.  I have nothing left to give.  It is really hard when an elderly person is toxic to you because they are so vulnerable and dependent but i simply cannot do it anymore.  I asked my fucking rotten mother to fill out a simple application to so she could get help with transportation.  I explained how that would help me out a lot.  This was three months ago.  I have reminded her several times after that.  tonight I asked if she had done it and she said no and then started to say she was losing her voice so she wouldn't have to talk to me about it.  I lost it.  I hung up on her /she is currently staying at my rich bitch sister's house because she was pet sitting for them when they were on their fourth vacation of the year.  my sister has been lying, manipulating, gaslighting, etc.  tonight she tried to bait me into a fight again to get her narc supply.  i didn't respond.  she is going to try to use that against me but it's preferable to me to have no contact.  she is absolutely vile.  she has been stealing family property out of my mother's house and not telling anyone which i just found out about.  the list goes on and on.  
i'm really done.  i could care less about my sister and would be thrilled to never talk to her again but my mom is a huge problem.  there is no point in trying to enlist my sister or deadbeat brother to try to figure out what to do with her.   last time i tried to talk to my brother about all this via email he simply didn't respond and my sister is a sadist narc so i am on my own and my mother will take no action on her own behalf.  it's like they are all dead weight and worse just dragging me down into my grave laughing all the way.
i think what i am going to do is call the clinic and try to get an appointment with a social worker or doctor to get her evaluated and get help with figuring out what to do with her.  I have been trying to hang on but i just can't anymore.  i just can't.  i don't know what else to do.  I would hire an attorney to deal with them but i can't afford it.
my mom is my only friend or at least i thought she was.  i guess she's not.  i guess she never was.  fuck.  what an awful night.  i need to withdraw into myself and stop thinking about them entirely.  i need to try to calm down.  take some deep breaths.  it's not my fault my mom doesn't love me.  does that mean i am unloveable?  i have no other ""love"" except from my cat.

I just hate this so much. I've tried my best to stay positive and not wallow in this sinking depression but it's just getting so hard. I cant catch a fucking break! This is not fair, and I dont understand why this is happening to me, or what I did wrong to deserve this!

I just am trying to do what's best for my daughter but now my health is an issue, I dont care how horrible I feel, I've been sick this whole pregnancy,  hg, high blood pressure,  severe anemia, I just feel like an induction is going to happen before 37 weeks :( I feel like if they induce today I would have failed a second time at having a healthy baby. ",depression
Well it's baby time,"Well things have changed drastically, this is probably the last update for a while. I made it to 34 weeks & 5 days pregnant. The 1st goal was 32 weeks, the 2nd goal was 34 weeks, and the 3rd goal was 36 weeks. Well we didn't make it to 36 weeks.

The baby is perfectly healthy and doing extremely well, I on the other hand am slowly getting worse and worse, so being pregnant any longer isn't really an option. 

So instead of having a December baby, we will be having a November baby. I am not dialated at all, so they have to start that process, it will take about 12 hours, if that doesnt work, they will attempt again, and then they will start my induction process. So we will be having a baby in the next 48-72 hours, or earlier, depending on how my body goes. 

I am upset, and disappointed, and my anxiety is kinda high, and I am doing my best to stay calm.  I will update as I can. Thanks for prayers & good thoughts. Thank you.",depression

Hollow,"I'm turning 30 in a few weeks and have been depressed since I was 14. Today while driving around at work, it just hit me, I feel hollow, so incredibly empty inside. I have good friends, an amazing wife, we just bought a house which is kind of crazy and not helping. I keep trying to fill the void, I've done it with food, buying something nice for myself and lately I've been drinking more which my wife isn't very happy about. I want to be the best husband there is but until I can feel something again it'll be very tough, and I have no idea where to start.

There's nothing..,"No matter what I try to say or do I can never form the right words to express what I am feeling right now.. my mood and emotions have been depleting these past couple of weeks especially on the weekends when I am at home.. to where I dont do anything, I stay in bed all day.. I do try and just get out for a few minutes but lately that's been hard as well as my anxiety just kicks in and keeps me away.. I feel like I'm going backwards, I don't know what to do.. I feel so alone, it's getting harder to want to do anything, and I'm just so done.. today I've been having so many ""episodes"" where so many emotions just come out of nowhere and i just cry.. ",depression

Update on Good News!,,depression
Forgotten and Alone - could use a friend,"I'm 67 years old, married to a good man (my second marriage) for 17years.  Between us we have 5 children and 5 grandchildren.  We live in a retirement community that is very active.  Over the years I've joined clubs, zumba classes, went to clubhouse dances.   We had a group of friends that we did things with for years.   Lately that all seems to be changing and the group has drifted apart.   We all have had our health issues and I know that is the reason.  We're just not as young as we used to be,  we're busy with our families.   My husband and I have had a lot of health issues, surgeries, and financial issues that have kept us from participating like we used to.   When stressed/overwhelmed I retreat into a shell for awhile until things are sorted out   I've been like that all my life, I cant change that.     Is it wrong to expect a friend to reach out to me to ask how I'm doing/ or where have you been?   No one calls anymore or stops in.  Not even our neighbors. Two houses away are what we considered our closest friends.  They just stopped coming around or calling, even though we reached out to them. The men are ok, he went back to work..understandable.   But her and I were always together.   She and I belong to a weekly lunch group that  I introduced her to.   I haven't been able to go because of money/doctors appt.  She's been babysitting a lot, so she doesnt go a lot either but still keeps in touch with them.   It really hurts me that noone calls me to see how I'm doing, not even her.   I had surgery this summer.  Only one from the group sent me a card.   She stopped by once, but I haven't seen her since.  She just had another grandchild. She usually comes running over to show pictures. Not this time.  She shared with the group in a text, if it weren't for that I wouldn't have even known the baby was born.  That's how they all communicate, texting. For reasons unknown and an antiquated phone, I get all their texts  but when I respond they don't see it, or they just don't bother to respond acknowledge me.    I've missed activities with them because of it, couldn't get tickets to a play because I couldn't get through in time. I reached out to them individually to give condolences, best wishes, with no response.  But no one bothers to check in with me.  They do with one other in the group that doesn't text at all.   They all send flowers and visit when someone is sick.    I'm babbling now. Just feeling sorry for myself.   People come in and out of my life so quickly.    I feel like I haven't a friend in the world, forgotten.   ",depression
couple of suggestions,"1. Try not to work on solutions in crisis.   I was with my wife on a trip, she went inside and I wasn't sure if she turned the car off, pushed the button, but make sure I took my keys.  When I came back, the car would not open and I thought the car was still on and basically went bananas, running around trying to figure out what to do.  My wife calmly realized that there is a manual key inside the fob that she used.  I will work on developing systems for stress, recognizing what I did wrong, but it is an oncoming challenge.    2. Measurement  I am not going to measure myself against people who are calmer under stress.  Part of this is physiological.  I will measure if I am making progress, and be happy if that's happening. 
3. Types There's 2 basic types of depression, situational, dealing with challenges, and physiological, your body makeup.  As to life's challenges, you try to make yourself better.  Physiological, you try to understand yourself when you're doing well and create systems or procedures for dealing with crises though as (1) above shows, you may not always be successful. 4. Reward I have been at this thing we call life for around 6 decades.  How hard you work, getting feedback, education, detail, they will all help you to be successful.  The tough thing is the feedback may not be immediate.  You can work hard and not see results, and the benefits will be seen many months or even years later.  You may have to refine what you do and get advice or feedback.

An uplifting story,"I wanted to share something here that I thought people might appreciate. It kind of made me feel better about things.  This is a true story.
A few days ago I was working for about a half an hour in an assisted living place.  At this particular time they had some chairs set up in the main lobby area and about a dozen of the residents there were sitting in the chairs.  They were all quite elderly, some with obvious health problems.
There was a band setting up in front of them and tuning up their instruments.  there were about 5 or 6 people in the band, most of them older too.  I'd say they ranged in age from 60's to 80's.  They were not residents but had come to perform and provide some entertainment.  Instruments were a couple of fiddles, a guitar, an accordian, someone on piano and a singer.
Anyway, after tuning up for a few minutes I heard one of the members of the band, a lady/the singer, introduce the band and then say something like they knew people there had some struggles and life could be hard but they reminded them to try to stay positive and she encouraged them to sing along, clap, or even dance.  She didn't say this condescendingly, she was just a very down to earth and compassionate seeming person.
My back was to them most of the time while I was working but I did occasionally look over my shoulder at the band and the audience.  They finally started to play and were really good.   Their first song was You are My Sunshine and after a minute or so you could hear the old folks clapping a long.
I didn't expect this but that's about the time a started to cry.  It was just so poignant, these people coming to entertain and the old folks, despite their circumstances, enjoying the show and even joining in.  I continued to work but was kind of crying sniffling through most of it, couldn't stop myself and was trying also not to be seen because it was kind of embarrassing.  They played other songs like ""If you're happy and you know it clap your hands"" and ""Look on the sunny side of life"", etc.  
About 10 minutes in I finally started to pull myself together and got the crying under control.  They were playing a lively song and I looked around over my shoulder and I saw these two really elderly residents, a man and a woman, out in front of the audience up there dancing a lively jig together.  I just completely lost it and started to cry again.  :  )
Anyway, I thought this whole thing was so touching and inspiring to see these people enjoying themselves despite their age and circumstances and also the band being so cool and generous..  Just all around good feelings and hope and resiliance shining through.  
I finally finished my work and went into the bathroom to wash my face with cold water and took a few breaths.  I felt really good and sort of in awe of what I had just witnessed, my faith in the goodness and toughness of people renewed.  Made me feel less depressed and hopeless.  If these people could pull out the strength and courage to experience joy in life, then by God, couldn't I?  couldn't we all?
I don't know, I just thought it was an uplifting experience I wanted to share it.  ",depression
Never ending struggle,"My entire life has been a struggle for me to cope with. I wish I could finally gain peace in my life and not have to be wondering what kind of disaster awaits me every day. On top of that, I was on a flight last week that went through a bad storm and I thought we were actually going to crash. The thing is, I realized at that moment that even though I was terrified, I was ok about not having to face life anymore. I'm just so tired of trying to keep up with all of life's demands. I can't emphasize enough how very exhausted I am mentally. ",depression
Just need a good cry,"Do you ever just need a good cry but can't seem to get there to get that realease you need?

LikeIi feel happy, except for today it's like i've been mad at every little thing. I'm not nieve to thinnk I have too many problems that I can't handle, I know that's not the case and i'm very fortinate for what I have, but I can't seem to destress at all and it's really getting to me.

Good news,"We finally got some good news! I got the results of my 24 hour urine! Protein level was 124, anything under 300 is amazing! My bps have been good and ultrasounds are good. I'm feeling more and more better about the fact we have decided to hold off on delivery! Now we both agreed that if anything changes then we will deliver but for now she is gonna keep baking! We will choose an induction date between the 36-37 weeks!",depression
Asking for prayers and good thoughts and wishes,"So I might just have pregnancy induced hypertension and not preeclampsia but there is no way to know for sure, so MFM has ordered another 24 hour urine collection to see if I have any protein in my urine, and if the numbers are good he is more comfortable holding off on delivery. Keep your fingers crossed and everything else crossed.",depression
I dont remember if I’ve posted here previously,"I may be new here or it's possible I just don't remember posting here before in this section of the site.  I was in the bipolar section, which I've been diagnosed with, but I relate much more to others with depression in terms of my past and present behavior, which includes a boatload of anger and acting out.  I was a self-medicator all through my life until less than 20 years ago.  As a result my life has been what you might call thoroughly wasted.  I didnt give a thought to my future or preparing for it.  Now facing my senior years I find myself on welfare which would not be the case had I sought help for my depression when I was younger.  
I hope to find help here in this forum and also possibly be of use to others.

coping mechanisms,so i've been struggling with my depression a little more than normal and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of things to do when things get unbearable,depression
I don't want to make the wrong decision....,"Today is not starting off as a good day. Its only 830 in the fucking morning and I am already in tears and angry. I hate that I see so many different Obs and they can't get on the same page and understand what I want. I swear I think they are trying to scare me into delievery for tomorrow! Its not something that I want, but why don't I want it? 

I am so scared of making the wrong decisions. I don't know if I am withholding off on delievery for a few weeks because its what's best for her, or for my own selfish reasons? I don't know if I am holding off on delivery because I don't want to go through the NICU experience again, or because I feel like the safest place for her is inside me for as long as possible. 

I remember the NICU experience with Aiden, and it was horrible, and I understand that girls mature faster, and she has gotten more help then Aiden has. She has gotten the mag, she's got the steroid shots for her lungs. However we are still looking at NICU time before 36 weeks no matter what. 

Is it bad that I want to experience the normal birth, and baby bonding after she's born. This pregnancy has been so hard, this pregnancy will be my last, and I feel like I have been robbed of everything that is joyous. 

I am terrified of making the wrong decision, like how do I know what's the right decision. How does one make a decision like this. Yes I understand the doctors have their opinions, and we should listen to them, but they aren't all on the same page, and I feel like they are not listening to what I want.

I have been so sick since day 1. I have been hospitalized on bedrest and just failing at this.  I have to do another contraction stress test because there are no variables on my last monitoring. I know I've had one before and did fine, but I am scared and upset and dont know why this is happening to me.  I've been in this hospital for a month now, I am on so much medication and I go for ultrasounds every day, trying to get to term.  I am laying here in the bed crying (I was already an emotional mess today) waiting for an OB nurse to come up and induce contractions and hoping my daughters heartrate doeant drop with the contractions because if it does happen, it will change everything.

Paralyzed by this bout of Depression,"My husband and I moved from my home of 25 years in PA to Florida this past May. We always came to this area for vacation and saved for 10 years to buy our beachhome here, in our dream location. But the never-ending vacation has quickly turned into a nightmare of depression, loneliness, and solitude. My husband is always either working or watching sports on TV in his “man cave”. He’s a good man and a hard worker so I’m not coming down on him. He leaves at 5am and doesn’t return home until 5:30pm, and is in bed for the night around 8:30. So 3 hours a day is what I have to work with and he’s usually preoccupied or “unwinding”. Anyway, I have a fear of meeting new people so leaving my entire family and small circle of friends behind has left me lonelier than ever. There are even some days when I done utter a single word. But I hide it all behind a pretty smile and a “happy” Facebook page... until today. I can’t hold up the mask any longer and I’m afraid of what will happen if he sees the REAL me and what is going on inside my head. We have already weathered a couple storms of his infidelity and I simply can’t go through that again. I don’t know what snapped today, but I find myself thinking about how differently he could live his life if I were gone. Let me be clear, I have no intention of killing myself, they are just scenarios racing through my mind. I don’t know where to go from here. I can’t get out of bed, have no appetite, and don’t want to to anything but sleep in hopes that tomorrow will be better and today would just end already! I’ve had bouts before, but nothing this crippling (except the affairs). I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, and I am serious considering asking to be placed back into the hospital for intense therapy. Thanks for listening... I just needed to vent to someone who understands. ",depression
Making Friends,"Hello, I am new here so forgive me if this question has already been asked. Why is it so hard to make friends when you're bipolar and have mdd?

Any advice on how to make friends when you have a mental illness?",depression
Will I ever feel better?,"I’ve been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember.  I’ve been in and out of counseling and I’ve been on and off anti-depressants.  I’m not on them now because I really don’t like being on medication even if it makes me feel better.  The last anti-depressants I weaned myself off made me sick, so now I really don’t want to get back on them.
I feel like I’m tired 24/7.  I have no energy or motivation whatsoever and that makes me feel even worse.  I’m someone that likes to be productive and I don’t like sitting around doing nothing.  I do go to the gym four days a week with my boyfriend, but I never feel like going.  If it weren’t for him, I probably wouldn’t go at all.  The smallest task takes up too much energy that I don’t have.

I’m going through a lot right now, but so are many other people.  I can see that there are a lot of hurting people on here.  Thankfully everyone seems so supportive and that’s good to see! ",depression

I was taken to another empty with a bed were I was monitored. I was not able to be left alone I even had to pee in a cup with a nurse starring me down. I had to stay there overnight before they would let me leave. needless to say i'm absolutely terrified to speak up about it again and I just feel so alone with it,depression

I Just Dont Know Anymore,"Apologize in advance for the long winded post. 
I just feel like I don't know what to do anymore with my life or what the point of anything is really and feel like I have no idea what I'm doing in life and just want it to end.
I guess a little backstory is needed here for context. Currently, I'm a 32 year old male living in Phoenix, Az. I've suffered from ongoing depression (and some doctors say that I'm Bipolar type 2) since I was in middle school. I don't really have any reasons to be depressed I just constantly am. My parents never really directly got me the help (I did see a counselor from time to time) I needed as they were worried that it would ruin my dream of being in the Marines when I would get older since that was all I wanted to be since I was a little kid. All in all the school years were kind of rough for me but I was able to live a pretty normal upbringing.  Right after high school, I enlisted in the Marines Corps for 9 years until I was forced out in the spring of 2014 as the Marine Corps choose not to accept my 3rd reenlistment contract. Over the course of those 9 years I drank A LOT (since getting out I have pretty much given up on drinking) and continued to suffer from depression, I had many a nights sitting on the couch and just wanting to end it all while staring at any number of guns and ammo I kept in the house. While there were a lot of dark days in the Corps there were a lot of good ones as there were always good friends in close proximity and PT/intense work to keep my mind off things. 
After leaving the Marines I returned home to Phoenix to spend more with my son (he stays with his mom and my ex-wife) and family. I was able to land a decent job with decent pay in the IT security field. However, I feel like my life just seems to have been slowly getting worse since trying to integrate back into ""civilian life"". I constantly feel like an outsider everywhere I go and hardly make attempts to connect with people (both old and new) which has led me to become quite the anti-social person and I basically just go to work and then back home again to sit on my couch all day.  I sleep during my lunch break every day and go to bed mostly at 8 as I'm just so tired all the time. There are some nights where I just can't fall asleep and will just lay awake staring into the dark till I finally drift to sleep at around 1 am and then the entire cycle continues.  
I have sought out help many times since leaving the Marine Corps from going the VA, to private Dr's and counselors, and even a stay at a mental hospital and IPO group sessions. I even tried TMS therapy, all have shown little to no improvement for my depression. I mean the meds help out a little, but when I'm on them I am just basically a blob of a person that is totally content with life to just sit and stay on the couch, sure I'm not as depressed but I'm also not happy I just feel like blah...... At least when I'm not on my meds I have bursts of energy and happiness randomly until I come crashing down into a pit of depression. 
My work has begun to horrible suffer from my lack of caring about anything. I just get to work every day and just try and do as little work as possible because 1) it would require me to make decisions (and that’s really starting to freak me out in general) 2) I would be forced into meeting and conversing with people and 3) I just don’t care about the work anymore. I would like to think that I'm pretty good with computers (training from the Marines) and use to enjoy working on them but now I can't stand to be on them. I would rather play solitaire on the computer then try and get any work done.
I've tried getting into a lot of different hobbies and activities but frankly, none of them hold my interest for long and they all just seem like work to me without any kind of pay off. I have zero interest in doing anything and would prefer to just stay on my couch and watch different seasons of Star Trek all day. Also, I just can't ever seem to make a decision about what to do. Hell, I won't even eat food all day as the stress of trying to figure out what sounds good freaks me out. I'll flip through Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime for an hour trying to figure out something to watch but in the end, I just say ""fuck this"" and just go back to watching Star Trek. I won't even play video games anymore even though that has been my favorite thing to do since I was a kid. 
My head continues to fill with thoughts and images of pain, suicide, and degrading thoughts (my brain likes to put statements like ""your a POS"" on repeat in my head). Most mornings I wake up depressed because I didn’t die somehow in my sleep. I secretly wish every day that I get ""taken out"" by something just so all of these thoughts and feelings will just finally end. I mean because in the end its just one life that in the grand scheme of things and the universe doesn’t really matter. Nothing I feel like I do really matters. 
Honestly, I didn’t plan to live this long when I was going up.  I never really thought about what I wanted to do with my life and once you’ve lived your dream and then get kicked out of it you really feel lost and unsure about what to do for the rest of it. 
I think I'll just stop here as this post has gotten way too long and I've just been typing without thinking.
TL;DR I've dealt with depression my whole life and now I feel like I'm at a point of not knowing what to do about anything.

can’t stop messing up,I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now and my medicine seems to help but tonight me and my boyfriend got in a really big fight and everything was all my fault and I just can't help but feel so horrible.

I LOVE YOU,"I feel like screaming to the world ""I LOVE YOU!!"" but people might think I'm crazy haha. so writing here hopefully someone will read this message. 
I love you. yes, you. I might not know you but I do love you and if you don't believe me, believe that someone does. A friend, family member. don't say no one loves you because that isn't true. You might not believe in God, but I know there is a God and that God loves you more than anything. 
I'm sorry if my message is annoying to anyone but I feel extremely blessed, that I must share it with those that might be struggling. I understand how horrible you might feel today. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I shared a lot on this group my thoughts and feelings. I felt suicidal before. I felt helpless before, like a mistake, like gross garbage. sometimes I still feel that way. but right now I will enjoy and use this moment of joy. yes, this moment might go away and tomorrow I might just not feel it anymore but I will remember this moment and other moments in my life where I felt joy.
It's hard to explain how I feel but its kinda like a very heavy thing has been lifted off my back and it feels extremely good. I know my words are just words to some of you but I hope one day you feel the same joy I feel. All I can say Is I love you all. I love life. I love challenges. I love growing. being depressed I forget who I am. I forget that I love life. but I hope you can feel it. don't focus on the bad. there is so much good around. look and you will see.",depression

Looking Back,"I was cleaning up some files on my laptop and I found the monalogue my daughter wrote for her admission into a drama program.  It was about my depression and at the time I had no idea I was having such an effect on her.  We have since had some very open conversations and she is even taking a college program for addictions and mental health.  I am very proud of her, she has such an acceptance and kindness about her.  I have to admit though that reading this today really hit home.  I am doing ok but work is a struggle and I know I have to do things to keep me in a good place mentally.  I was told last week that I am not my normal cheerful self so I am really working on doing things I enjoy to get back to myself.  I am thankful for this site and my friends and family who have been so supportive.  Here is the monalogue she wrote.  She wrote it 5 years ago when she was 17 years old.  I won't deny that I cried when I read it again.  P.S.  I am sitting here with my headphones on but I'm just enjoying the music, not trying to tune out the world.

I wake up every morning hoping that today will be the day.
Today will be the day that my mom is finally herself again.
But it never is. I wake up to make myself breakfast, and she’s still in bed.
When I get home from school she’s sitting there with her headphones on full blast and can barely take one look at me.
When the headphones finally come off, I like to tell her funny stories from that day.
She tries to smile to show me she cares, but when she does, that smile is empty.
It used to be so genuine and full of love.
But That’s not how it is anymore.
Whenever I ask her how her day went, she sits there, cries, and tells me how much of a failure she thinks she is.
After that she goes to her room to cry even more behind closed doors. She’s not a failure though.
And I know that whatever she is going through is really tough, but I will never truly understand it.
I don’t know how to deal with this. All I know is that I can’t handle seeing her sit there and cry every day.
 I need my mom back.
 The mom that has so much love in her heart.
And the mom that could light up a room with one single smile.
 That’s the mom that I’ve looked up to and aspired to be like my entire life.
 I still love her – more than anything.
She’s my best friend and somehow she raised the perfect daughter.",depression

hhmm,"been a long while since i been around here,im still alive. the world is apuzzle with no muzzle to make it discoverable.pain and hurt,my anxiety is a non stop volcano squirt.we help no one and think everyone is not hurt, but the world screams in pain,fractures, flames,ingnorance, greed, its always the same.standing together is what we all need, but miles apart is our instinctual creed.we feel seperate, divided, no purpose or common seed.but the commonality is our bridge the need of human kind its how we could all be freed.we love and hate, we judge and defend.we think its seperate but seperated is all ordanes.the similarities are obvious if opening our eyes were a defense,we would see it all clearly, but we see only ourselves.understand we are the same if just for a moment, just a second.maybe different color or beliefs,geography or maybe differnt friends.you hate a few, love a small crew, defend a view thats dependent on you. but the underlying needs, what we need and decree.if we open our eyes they are all the same,too be free. FREE to live and love, and hate, and forgive as we see fit, or ,maybe just the things that makes us fit.into that little picture that divides us all,splits us into groups to serve,, divided,, powerful,power hungry elite, decitful, emotionless, hungry,dividing,greedy,powerhungry,worthless elite basterds,,so that we can all be controlled why we fight amongst ourselves, and they take it all..our money,, our souls,,our identity,,to serve their purpose for free....i just want a house,ill even build it myself if i had the money to get what i need.a little bit of land to live on grow my food.too just be ME..i hate this world i just want too die anymore,the faith that could be a doctrine we could live by is just another bad mood,i cant stop thinking..i'm not dead yet ,my fight is still there..vote, fight.dont judge..help each other.. have that FAITH,.. im holding on too it still why i still breath, but its getting harder..lets help each other..i would like too see every member here a friend too every other member..that would give me back some faith !!!!!! it dont matter if you dont like what i said here its about us as a human species!! WE NEED EACH OTHER WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT !!! no matter where you came from or what color you are, or what you believe.",depression
New to group,"I went through a depression a few years ago and since being medicated I’ve done quite well.  I was always able to get up and go to work but I struggled with being around people after work.  I would put my headphones on and just tune out the world around me.  I have had days since where I struggled and today is one of those days.  The first thing I thought when I woke up this morning is “I just don’t want to get up today”.  Work has been difficult but that’s to be expected and I’ve always found it to be very rewarding work.  I work with children with special needs.  I cried a few times on the weekend, which is something I did a lot of during my depression.  I don’t want to go back to that so I am really trying to look at the positives in my life, I have many, and reach out to friends, which I didn’t do before because I didn’t want to bother anyone.  I’m hopeful that once I get to work, see friends and hopefully share some laughs I’ll be ok.
it could be all circumstantial, as work has been difficult and my dads health is not the best and that bothers me.  Whatever it is, I don’t want to go back to what I went through before.",depression
Halloween,"I've been in the hospital for 3 & 1/2 weeks due to severe preeclampsia symptoms and anemia along with other complications with my pregnancy. My hope was to be able to leave at this point but no. My son is 3 years old and Halloween is next week and I am going to miss it with him. It is just not fair.I have so much guilt for the past 8 months, while trying to stay alive and keep my daughter healthy my son has missed out on so much. He deserves better. I know he is only 3 and probably wont ever remember this period in his life, but I still feel really bad. He has been so amazing these past 7 months,  he has been mommy's buddy, I feel horrible that he has had a sick mommy for so long and now has a mommy who isnt home with him :( ",depression
I'm new to these support groups.,"Hi. I don't really know how this works but today was awful. I was blamed by so many people for doing something I didn't even do. On top of that today, I had a mini panic attack. And to finish the day I had a 2 hour fight with my parents that ended with them telling me to stop being such a sorry human being. So yeah, life sucks right now. I don't really know what else to say but if anyone of y'all's days were bad I would be happy to see if I could at least help y'all today. If anyone even responds to this I probably won't respond until later because I'm not up for even being awake right now. I just figured something like a support group would help. Sorry for rambling, goodnight.",depression
I'm back,"Hello Everyone, I'm back!
For those of you who know my story and my journey on here I apperciate your support, and for those of you who don't know me or my journey here is a brief summary of my life and who I am.
I am 20 years old and I started with daily strength about this time of year last year and it was to deal alll of what i was going through just to be able to have an outlet with people who may understand a bit more of what i am going through.(before i continue please excuse my poor grammar)  I lost my 15 year old sister Cienna last year from an undetected heart condition that push me past a breaking point and and pushed me back into a really bad depression. Truth is that i was dealing with depression way before my sister passed but that put me back on the path towards darkness and desrcution. Anyways After my sister died i moved to a different place with new people new job and it wasnt easy to adjust having socail anxiety and being socially awkward. And i have accumulated quite the supporters and am very greatful form them. 
Now back to my update. SO i was looking at my job portal for my job to check my payslips and what not and i come across a job evalution that i was not aware of until today which is october 25 2019 mind you the date of this job evalution was made on the 20 of october and it was posted 2hrs from the time that i had looked at it. normally when you are giving a prefomance evalution your sat down within thoses days and ask to sign to acknowledge that you have been talked to and understand the terms of your contract and that you need to fix it before there is another one that can possible terminate you. So i am pissed off because im seeing this and i dont remeber having a conversation with any of my managers but i guess we shall see what happens today ",depression
RAGE,"I am in a rage today / tonight...I'm having an extremely bad time at work....All summer I was sexually verbally abused by a coworker and now I am being verbally abused by someone different. He has called me a ( the N word...yeah you heard me right the N word ) bit**
ALL week ALL week. I lost my sh** on this person today and I have been crying all day and even now...I am filled with SO much rage...I can only fantasize about this person getting their face rearranged. I cannot leave this dark place I am in right now. 
I am not a violent person but its all I can think about is being violent to this person. 
I wouldn't but I just want to end it all.......................Like I said I wouldn't but  all the pain and sadness would go away if I had the courage to end it.
PLEASE tell me I am not alone...I feel it.

Fed Up,"I am fed up with barely being able to make ends meet. I am fed up with a shitty commute. I am fed up with dealing with bitchy people. I want to visit my family for Christmas and I asked management on the 3rd and they have still not gotten back to me. FUCK. I just had a visit from my downstairs neighbor; apparently, when I am getting ready for work around 4-5am in the morning the floor creaks and he can't sleep. He suggested that I walk on the balls of my feet. I told him I would walk in my home however I pleased. I've had dates that have led to absolutely nothing. I am sick of this bullshit. Why is it so motherfucking hard to live, to work, to fall in love? FUCK ME",depression
Been awhile,"I haven't been active here in a while as a college student I get very busy. But my depression hit me hard again tonight, it's even worse when I'm so empathetic and I just soak in everyone's emotions.  I listen, I help and then end up abandoned later on.  It hurts so much.",depression
First post in this group,"Forgive if I cover old ground for those in some of my other groups.  
Depression has been a big part of my soul for the past several years.  I am bipolar so depression and BP go hand in hand often.  I have a lot of shame and guilt of some things that happened when I was in the military and these events eventually forced me out (33 years, very senior officer).  I retired from my own decision but I could no longer be there.  Also, my heart was failing, due to the depression, that would have also forced me out on medical retirement.  Either way, I was out and I needed to move on.  The career was literally killing me - ORs, ICUs, Multiple hospitalizations, a couple of stints at mental health hospitals (4 weeks at the longest), and so on.  Depression still plagues me today.  I still have the shame, and even if that goes, the depression has scared me to much.  What do I do?  I can not rid myself of this and it just eats my soul.  ",depression
Being human hurts me and I can't escape. Trigger,"I live in the UK where on the surface it's a civilised country who looks after people and animals. But we don't, they got rid of mental asylums and replaced them with care homes and so many people are forced into care and once you're in there, unless you have someone fighting for you you could simply be having mobility or memory problems but be forced to live with people who eat their own waste. I'm seeing it now and have seen it for years, people being kept in bed and the only interaction they get is being rolled over to clean them, year after year and then they die in agony because the home hasn't sorted end of life medication out and they have no family or their family refuses hospitalisation. As for animals... Feel like I was born on the wrong planet and should leave ",depression
Advice needed,"Hello All,
you guys and girls have given me strength and support before and i need some advice.
Living with depression for 10+years but diagnosed after a particularly rough patch 2 1/2 years ago. Also have Anxiety, and several physical ailments that are ALWAYS apparently ""caused by the mental health issues"".
I am under gp, close monitoring by the mental health team and my gp is liasing with a psychiatrist. I often feel like a burden on the system but it's took a lot to get any help atall. I have managed to work through a lot, even when it's the last thing I want to do but the last few weeks I have been as close to rock bottom as I can be and still falling. I want and need time off work, but financially that would cripple me, my debts are just about under control but one late payment and I'm back to square one. My head is spinning and I just don't know what to do next.
sorry for the essay, I guess I needed to vent ",depression
Alone,"lately I’ve felt so alone. Like I’m falling away from all of my friends. I’m working constantly and it’s a 3-11 shift so I don’t get to do anything after . I’m also 9 months pregnant right now so I can’t really go out a lot. I think that may be another reason I’m so depressed, hormones. I feel like when I’ve tried to reach out to people I felt like I could rely on , they just turn it in to stuff about them. And it sucks, bc I love helping people but I need help too sometimes. I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to anymore.",depression

Omgosh,"Bad word bad word. Last week was pretty bad. 
I told my friend Saturday that this week has to be better. No way could it be any worse. 
Well Sunday took that as a challenge. Let me start at Thursday though. 
I was supposed to go over to my parents house and help my mom while my dad went on a poker run with his bike club. 
Thursday he started to feel sick. No biggie. He beat pancreatic cancer but not without taking a toll. 
Friday mom msged me and said that dad had the stomach flu. I told her I wanted to come and help. But mom was worried about me. If I get sick I get bronchitis and it goes into asthma.
Saturday he quit eating. Not good. But talked him into eating. 
Sunday he woke mom up and told her he needed to go to the hospital. 
My mom msged me and told me she needed me. Dad was in the hospital. 
I was at church. My phone was off. 
I got a ride to the hospital. When I got there I found him. He passed away.
Turned out he had blood poisoning not the flu. ",depression
I'm Trash,"I feel like absolute garbage. I don't really know why. I've been trying really hard to stay positive but things are beginning to feel like too much and I'm breaking. It was my birthday 3 days ago and I turned 20 years old. I felt horrible about it then happy but now I feel more depressed about my age. there's too much happening and I have mix emotions about it all and it's making me feel so confused and sick.
tonight I feel so horrible. I feel like a disgusting terrible daughter. I feel so dirty and just trash. taking a shower wouldn't help. I just feel so gross. and I just can't handle all of this anymore. At this point, I can't tell if I'm really depressed or tired or even bored. my mind and body just feel like its shutting down as if I was dying. I feel like I reached out too much to people and now I'm just an annoying child to everyone. or if I even try to reach out people get scared and think I will kill myself. I won't. I'm not at that level of emptiness. 
I feel alone when people say they are here for me. It's like feeling alone in a crowded room. your not actually alone but you are. my soul, body or whatever it just craves affection. I deeply just want a hug, cuddles something to make me feel alive, loved and human.
I feel like now when I talk to people, I'm just the definition of fake. fake smile, fake personality. I honestly don't know who I am anymore. someone told me she was so glad to see that I'm doing better but I honestly don't know anymore if I am or not. How can I feel suicidal when I know for a fact that I won't kill myself. I don't want to die but I don't want to live. 
I have no idea anymore. medication isn't helping. the pills just seem like air.

I’m so tired,"I am a divorced 42 yr old single mom. My only child just went to college and now I'm truly alone. I come home every day to an empty house. I dedicated my life to my child and now I don't have a purpose. I hide it well, I go to work, I laugh at jokes, and I make plans, but inside I'm crying. I cry all the way home every day. To make it worse, I thought my daughter and I were close, we were her whole life, but now she's an ""adult"" and doesn't need me. She goes to my sister for advice and doesn't want to be tied to the house in any way. I just don't understand. All I wanted was to get married and be a mom. I'm a good mom, I was a good wife, but my husband never loved me and now my only child doesn't want me either. There are days like today where all I want to do is go to sleep and not wake up. I feel like I have lost everything. ",depression
Trying to Change My Username to SomeGuy092,"As of right now, I'm sent a request to the dailystrength.org team to change my username to SomeGuy092. I do not feel strongly about any other words that can describe me without sounding too depressing. I'm black, I'm an American, and I'm a guy. I admit that I don't have the passion to describe myself any further. I believe that defines who I am and I'm okay with that. The username SomeDepressedGuy has to go. If I ever was to become special, that's fine. For now, I'm trying to at least be an average guy. I have enough problems trying to do the most basic of tasks every f------ day. Nothing is physically wrong with me, but I have problems taking care of myself. At the end of each day, I'm just some guy and nothing worse and I'm glad for that. I would like to remember to remind myself every night that I'm a human being instead of a scumbag. I still hate myself, but I still want to change my username to SomeGuy092. I read in a faq that I can only do something like this once and only if the team decides to grant the request. I am certain about this. Now, I have to wait and see if the dailystrength.org team will grant my request and allow my username to be changed.",depression

Big scare today,"m okay as is Bella but we had a scare this morning.

so as most know I am in the hospital with severe preeclamsia sysmptoms. I will be here till deliver. 

So I go for daily ultrasounds just to keep an eye on her growth and make sure she is doing well. Well this morning she wasn't moving very much and it took them like 30 minutes to catch her breathing when normally I am in and out of ultrasound in 10-15 min tops.

So they get me upstairs and put on the monitor (which is normal I go on it for 1 hour every 4 hours)
Then the OB comes in and tells me that they are concerned about the ba baby and want to see if she can handle contractions, so they advise me that they are going to give me some pitocin to induce contractions and make sure her heartrate doesnt drop from the contractions.
If it did then they were going to have to deliver today either via c-section or attempt a vag delivery
I was a fucking wreck, John was able to get here before the test started, they told me it might take a while because I needed to have 3 contractions within 10 minutes and I did in the 1st half hour amd her heartrate was fine, she passed the test. So no induction today. We are okay. I'm still trying to calm down as this has been a big scare. I'm only 31 weeks. So the thought of delivering today was very frightening. I didnt want to post anything or tell anyone until we knew what was going on.
Now I need a nap.",depression
Things better,"First, I do not want to diminish anyone's pain or challenges.  I can say that this should be a good year for me in terms of personal success.  I faced challenges and overcome them, and let me make some suggestions. Working hard can solve problems.  The difficulty is that frequently success does not come immediately.  If you are not doing well in school, you might study and the grade would still be hard, work in a business and you might not get promoted and still have a low salary.  But success frequently will come.  You keep analyzing, working, adjusting, researching, and success will come if you outwork others.  There may be challenges but hopefully you can embrace the challenge and uncertainty of life.  And there are difficult family, but I think you take them as they come, and if they marginalize or criticize you, you don't try to change them but realize their assessments don't matter.  I just saw Rocketman, the movie about Elton John, probably one of the leading singers of all time, a man known throughout the world.  His father left, and his mother said he was a disappointment, and suggested he marry a woman though she knew he was gay (homeosexual in those days).   He used large amounts of drugs, and almost overdoses and may have tried to commit suicide.  Ultimately he came to terms, realized he could not make his mother happty and did not need to try and made a profound impact upon the world.     ",depression
Postpartum question,"Hi all. I just had a question about antidepressants and post pregnancy.
I had my son back in April. Before I had found out I was pregnant I had just started Lexapro for anxiety. As soon as I took the test and saw a positive I quit it, despite reassurance from my psychiatrist that it was safe to take. (It wasn't, as they had to monitor his heart while I was pregnant) anyways, after birth I started it back up again right away as I wasn't breastfeeding and I was hoping it would help with baby blue and my anxiety. It did the opposite. I was so sad all the time, I couldn't eat, felt like crawling out of my skin. I haven't struggled with severe depression in 10 years and this hit me like a train. I stopped taking it after a few weeks and family could see this difference and I felt more like myself. 
I am very afraid to try it again. I want to not feel so anxious all the time and I hate having to go through the motions of a panic attack, but I'd rather this than that feeling of hopeless.
I guess my question is has anyone experienced a negative reaction to their meds after giving birth? And if so how did you go about dealing with it?",depression
Tonight Im drowning,"""I dont want it on my mind but tonight I'm weak so I'm gonna pull out pictures the ones with you in em laugh and cry a little while reminiscing.

7 years of Pop being gone is coming up on me fast,  a recent health crisis sort of pushed it to the back of my mind but looking at the calender today and seeing how close it really is has brought me crashing back to reality just in time for the nightmares and visions to rip my world away from me again. The pain of losing him is still there, the image of him taking my hand as he took his last breath is burned into my brain and starting to flash before me when I close my eyes. 

But I think what hurts the most this year is knowing that the one person who I thought I could count on to be there to always turn to has turned his back on me. Seeing how easily I am forgotten by a man who claims I am his best friend who he's afraid of losing hurts more then I ever thought possible. So I find myself looking at Pops  anniversary date looming over my head back to facing it along.  



""Im going under and this time i feel theres no one to save me. I need somebody to heal, I need somebody to love, i need somebody to have and somebody to hold.

Am I being unfair and expecting too much???,"I'm not one of those who invests a lot emotionally in many people. Last count was 4 and due to a crappy childhood none of those are family, who i could frankly take or leave, preferably leave. This does mean i invest a lot in those few important ones. 
My best friend (let's call him Ben) and I always just clicked. we talked all the time, has similar life experiences and knew everything about each other. Last year his wife kicked him out but we never found out why, so he came to live with me and my husband. I did my best to support but not smother if you know what I mean. Things were fine for maybe 4 months and then he started a relationship with a new woman and gradually got extremely secretive and withdrawn. It took maybe 6 months before if even met her, he'd already basically lived with her for 4 months but never clarified with me what was going on with living arrangements. Left his room a complete shit tip which I ended up cleaning. One of the most hurtful things was one weekend he was going away and parked his car outside my house didn't tell us or say hello, left it there and then picked it up the next day, again not a word. He was 50 feet away and couldn't be bothered to come in and say anything. I have tried to sort this with him.I write emails, messages, we've met up and tried to work through it but then he just goes straight back to ghosting me. This year I've probably seen him a max of 10 times and maybe 1 of those was instigated by him. I'm stuck in this loop of being so angry with him to really upset and questioning my self worth to thinking i should just cut ties to end the question mark and stop hanging about hoping for contact. Then I wonder if I'm being unfair and expecting too much. Just to be clear its not about the new relationship, met her and she's lovely. She's as puzzled by his behaviour as me. I can't keep being so conflicted with this.should I accept relationships change? Do i keep trying to mend things, but then it's all one sided. Do I just cut ties to protect myself. Problem is he's 1 of 2 people i couldn't imagine my life without.
Please help me",depression
Thinking about Changing My Dumb Username,"   Hey, I haven't been on here for a long while. I think I didn't post anything here for months. I left this place for a while because, I'm only talking about myself, it looked like to me that I was being too much of a downer. There are people with real and more serious bad times. Nothing out of the ordinary ever happend to me besides the Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Gustav, the flood in Baton Louisiana during Aug. 2016. Other than that I had a normal life. It looked like that to me, I felt as though I only had bad days and negative thoughts to vent instead of anything nice to say. So, I decided not to post any of that or talk about it except to my counselor.
   Meanwhile, I would use my journal irl. As for my username, Somedepressedguy, I think it stinks. IRL, don't want to be depressed forever. Being depressed shoud not define me, but I went ahead and gave myself the username anyway. I don't want to be known as some depressed guy. I never paid that much attention to my username in the first place. It may be just a username, but it's sort of how I'm identified since I chose it in the first place.
   I first got here because I was following a suggestion from a hotline called Crisis Text Line for the USA. I'm not going to give too much of a long sob story. Long story short, I felt like acting on killing myself, I contacted the hotline, and in the end, they gave me this website as a suggestion to help with coping. I took their suggestion, but I was still upset at myself at the time. So, I thought to myself in an offensive and sarcastic way, ""Why not just give myself the name, SomeDepressedGuy?! Why not?! Apparently, I'm going through a lot even though I have a normal life that a lot of people would kill for! Do I even have depression?!""
   I would normally say things like that to myself on a daily basis, I still do among other hurtful things. Looking at my username now, I think it may be too self-deprecating. On the other hand, I could be overthinking this. The truth is, I picked out the username to insult myself and not to make light of the people who have depression. I want to say that I am sorry for offending anyone if I did. I came crawling back here because I was feeling like I neither had any business being alive nor belonging anywhere at all. I tend to think like that on a daily basis as well.
   Yet, today, the feelings were stronger than usual. I wanted to kill myself again today. I only stopped because I still live with my mother and my siblings and one of them was walking by at the time. I came back here to follow the suggestion from the hotline to give it another try. They wanted me to come here to vent and express myself as a way to cope in the first place. I don't think I can guarantee posting here often. Most of the time, I don't have anything positve to say. I realized now that I have inadvertently pushed people away. They were people in real life and online including other websites who reached out to me. That was a long time ago. So, I don't an apology is going to help now.
   Anyway, while I was gone, I learned that even a small bit of positivity could go a long way like exercising. I won't see any changes for a while, but it's actually doing a little good. Yet, irl, I'm afraid if I do say anything positive it would sound insincere, fake, or sarcastic. So most of time, I don't say much irl. Anyway, I was thinking about figuring out how to change my username. Maybe I'm taking this too seriously or maybe I'm having an identity crisis, but I feel as though I want to change my username. I was thinking about changing it to something plain and not too different like SomeAverageGuy092 or something. I don't have many ideas. I'm open to suggestions. It feels fine to be back. Thank you for reading.",depression
Falling deeper and deeper..,"I've rewritten this over and over and I still cant form the right words to how I have been feeling.. I went from part time and started full time at my job from 8:30-5:00 typical shift.. like straight into it I mean the summer I was doing full time since the kids were out of school.. so I was used to it but not like this..  I knew what was coming and what I needed to do.. however from when I started full time in sept I haven't felt the same at all.. it has tested me, thrown me under, effected my mental health alot, I cant tell you how many times I have broken down crying.. there is so much is expected of me, making sure I have art prepared, full month of planning, and making sure I always have something to do.. from the beginning of Sept to now it has been hell and I dont know if I can do this anymore.. I keep doubting myself and thinking what did i get myself into?! Why did i agree to this? Also plus I have so many other things going on like trying to go back to school and finish my ece  online however that costs money, I found out my student loan got behind alot and no one told me and so now I have to pay that on top of paying it off...

Painted pillowcase for a loved one,"Why am I still so cut up about something that happened a long time ago? Every single day it's with me. I'm crying most of the time when I'm on my own. I'm hiding how I truly feel every day. My mood, it switches back and forth from despair to anger. It's been 3 years. I can't really open up to anyone about it because I'm supposed to have moved on. And it looks like I have to everyone else. Bringing it back up now would only humiliate me and cause gossip.The worst part is feeling like I can't move on. My late ex boyfriend took my heart when he left this earth, and I'm devastated. My current relationship is just awful when it comes to my part. And I feel so guilty. I just want to make him happy but it feels like an impossible task. He knows about my past but he doesn't understand how I feel. I don't think he knows how I currently feel at all. And I'm afraid if I told him I would lose him. In fact I know that for sure. How do you move on? I just want to forget and be happy! Damn I want to be happy like everyone else. I do feel like I'm on my own, I bought a puppy a week ago. I'm quite confused as to what my future looks like. That's if I can decide if I want one or not. Honestly I feel a mess. It's quite pathetic.It feels selfish of me to be constantly in this faded bubble of sadness, when there's people around me who are physically suffering with illnesses like cancer. My moms been given less than 6 months to live. But she's still got her brave face on. She hasn't been able to swallow for over a year, her voice box is messed up and she's fed through a tube through her stomach. She talks to me about everything and anything but I could never dream of burdening her with my old news. I need to be strong.. I haven't cried once over her illness, I'm just stuck in the past. I'm so scared, honestly. I have no idea what's going on anymore regarding my feelings. I feel locked in a box. Just bury me already.",depression
"Angry with a friend, am I over-reacting?","I have a friend that, overall, is a great friend, very supportive. But the last two times we've tried to get together for an online chat, she showed up over an hour late without letting me know she was running behind. I know she has a busy job that takes precedence, but I saw her online while I was waiting for her, so she could have sent me a quick text to let me know what was going on instead of just leaving me to wait and worry. That's on top of the last time we tried to get together in person, I had to ask her what time we'd be getting together twice before she told me she had to cancel. I am beginning to think I'm less her friend and more her charity case. Am I over-reacting?",depression
Bipolar depression,"Hey guys im new to this group and website. I was diagnosed with bipolar ll, borderline personality disorder, adhd, social anxiety, and panic disorder.

Not enough,"Hello everyone. I visited this site several years ago at my lowest when I felt like I had no one to talk to. I've been okay for awhile, kind of keeping my head just above the surface, but I can feel myself sinking again. I just needed an outlet.
That is not to say I'm at my worst. I dont want to take my life or anything of the sort, I'm just tired. Exhausted. I work 50 hours a week, am in school, just had my first baby in April, and am just trying to function. My baby boy is amazing, healthy, happy, and sleeps well throughout the night. I have a good job, a good family. I am happy with where I'm at in my life. But I'm just not happy with myself.
I feel like a failure. A bad mother, a bad wife. My son is with his grandparents during the day Monday thru Friday (6-3) so we can work and with us after. But he likes to go to bed around 7pm. I feel like I don't spend enough time with him. I have to work. We have a house payment, bills, student loans.. Im terrified that I'm not enough for my son. My husband and I used to watch TV shows and movies before in the evening but with the baby and classes it's difficult. I do go to bed a bit earlier because I'm tired and wake up at 4, so I feel guilty for that. I don't have time to clean as much, cook as much.. I still have a bit of the pregnancy weight. I feel as if I'm not good enough for him either.
I just feel like I'm never enough. Im trying so hard, doing what I'm able, but I feel like I could always do more. I love my family with all my heart but what if there is someone who can take better care of them? 
This is a different type of depression than I'm used to. I just feel so weighed down, so hopeless.  And I'm so much more frightened because I have more to lose.",depression

just weary of this,"I've been battling depression since I was 17  years old, and now I am in my 70's.  I have an active life and I do all the right things- still employed, exercise, walk each day, meditate, see a therapist, take depression meds, keep active socially, but everything I do seems like cardboard lately, just blah.  I'm tired of talking about this with my therapist  I don't discuss my depression except in a cursory way with my partner and friends.  They don't understand, even though they are sympathetic.  I understand why they don't understand.  You have to have experienced chronic depression to really comprehend what it's like.  Anyway, it gets old fast, and there's nothing that they can do to lift my depression anyway; the solutions have to come from me.
I just get so weary from this daily struggle. It saps my emotional strength.  This latest two month downturn started, I think, from the real disconnect that I feel with my son, daughter in law, and grandkids.  I am a blip on the screen in their lives, because of somrthing stupid that I said 5 years ago to my daughter in law.  I have apologized profusely and followed every decision that they've made about how much I'm allowed to visit , which is a few times a year for 4 hours each time.  It's scary for me to make the 2 plus hour drive each way in one day at this point in my life, and they will NOT come here.  My grandkids are old enough now that they really don't want to talk to me on the phone.  My son hates his sister (who does not have kids). My daughter and I have a great relationship, but she lives fairly far, so basically I feel that I have no family  (I'm divorced).
I've conscientiously worked to NOT have a ""poor me""attitude or demeanor.  Again, it gets old fast, both for me and others, and I am so fortunate in so many ways; I love my job, so far my health is good, so far my cognitive skills are good my partner, family, children and grandchildren, and my ex (I still keep an eye on him and help himbecause he has mental issues)are doing ok.  How can I lift out of this pit?  I DO NOT LIKE FEELING THIS WAY.
I would appreciate any comments or suggestions.  Just writing this makes me feel a little better.

Everywhere feels dirty and I just want to clean but I can't. The dog food has been left out so it smells, just the nature of the food we get for them and I hate the smell because it permeates everywhere. The cat litter smells, which I also can't lift and clean properly. Just can't cope with it all being so smelly and dirty. I dont like to live like this. ",depression

Than we talked some more and we got on subjects that were sensitive or I was touchy about.  I lost it and it was unproductive.  My cousin says just help her and leave.  It hard to do that.  After that experience I feel that give up feeling and anxious.    My former therapist said just do the best I can with her.  Can anybody relate?",depression

Not sure how to balance,"Hello everyone,
To make a long story short, I am a wife, mother, and special education teacher.  Everyday at work, I wear so many hats and come home mentally and physically exhausted. I feel like I can't do enough as far as my caseload goes and yes because I can handle difficult cases, I have the most involved kids with severe trauma, behavioral issues, and mental health issues. This year I just leave everyday thinking how do I go home to my husband and daughter. I have no energy to give to them. I am like a zombie when I get home. It's been depressing me lately and I just want more energy and time to give them. I feel overwhelmed and like a failure right now. I just wish I had more to give of myself.

(Cannot fake a torn labrum and herniated disk when the MRI proved them to be the cause of the 24-7 pain) even the people at physical therapy seem to shrug off my concerns of pain and discomfort.
my first husband was a cheater.. My second is a verbally abusive narcissist. My kids are exceptionally defiant to me and their dad tells me and them that their behavior is my fault.
I have no friends in real life.. Family only tolerates my existance. My mom is my best and only friend.

So freakin tired and depressed,"Well I guess this is a good and safe place to vent again. I’m not sure why I am so depressed, sad and feeling hopeless. It just seems the golden years ain’t so golden. I have been in Florida taking care of my 87 year old mom who is an amputee and has other serious medical issues. I’m going back to California hopefully in another 2 weeks once I secure her a full time live in aide. Been here since sept 6 when I took over for my sister. The problem is I have serious medical issues also multiple myeloma a form of cancer. I am exhausted. I have painted for her and done other fix ups in her condo have to set up a bedroom for her live in. Take care of her finances. She is appreciative but expects everything done in a minute if she brings up an issue. I also have to take care of my stuff in California where we have 2 adult children under or roof and 3 grandkids. The responsibility seems overwhelming right now. My mom is a depressed and anxiety ridden person and she is wearing off on me. So even going home is no picnic and when I get home I have to schedule full hip replacement surgery for myself. I can’t work due to the cancer and worry all the time about medical bills and going bankrupt if the cancer gets worse. I am on social security and so is my wife so we don’t have a big income and of course through the years we didn’t save enough for retirement for several reasons and despite all I do for family , I feel like a big failure in life. It is a hard feeling to deal with everyday. I know there are many people in worse financial and medical situations than me, but it just seems like I don’t know what .

Also got me a journal to start keeping.I am still not all that happy about being here for the next 11 weeks or a possible induction in 3-4 weeks, but we are trying to deal with it. Hubby is going to get me some adult coloring books and colored pencils and bring them tomorrow with a comfy blanket.My little man will be coming to see me tomorrow and I cant wait, I have been with him every day.

I don't even know how to talk about this,"This is soo hard.............
I didn't realize just how depressed I am until I attended a Bingo game yesterday. Everyone was laughing, smiling and there I sat, alone in the back and realized the depressed feelings.
I felt detached, unable to experience fun and joy, could not relate to those around me, could not join in, did not want to be there, it hurts to experience life.
This past year has been one continual traumatic experience, from bullying, to aggression displayed towards me so I feel unsafe. 
I no longer can be around people.  I am isolating to keep myself away from people.  I am fragile now and sad everyday. 
I try but contually get knocked down and now can't get back up.  So why bother. 
I guess it's getting to be a crisis, I didn't realize how far down I had gotten.  I reached out to my psych doc last week to ask if I could increase Lamictal and he said no, give it another two weeks. I am trying out a new therapist but can only see her once every two weeks, so inbetween those two weeks, I don't bathe, eat properly, no exercise, just living is almost too difficult. 
I'm 68 and feel I am at the end of my life.  I have no family or close friends. So, I sit alone watching the world go by, day after day.  I don't drive and am disabled, so I can't get out to do .... things.  My hobbies are beyond my ability.
I try to get one thing done each day and even that is too hard most times.  No one understands, no one understands just how difficult it is to live each day this way.

Bad day,"Today was supposed to be a good day, but it wasnt. Today was supposed to be amazing, but it wasnt. Today I had multiple breakdowns. Today I had enough. So hubby got paid today, so the plan was to take roommates to work, go to the doc grab some lunch, go to child support office, and then go shopping. However today did not go as planned. We leave the house and everyone is on edge I'm trying to ignore it because I wanted to have a good day. We stop at wendy's and everyone gets something to eat but me, because I dont like Wendy's, I just figured I'd grab something at McDonald's after we take roommates to work. 

Welp we get a flat tire, so we gotta get that fixed, 1st place wanted to charge almost 400 dollars for 2 new tires, but I found a different place and it is 44 dollars for a new one. Hubby goes to take money off our card and he is missing all his money, I log into the account and something from Google play charges almost 100 dollars, so we need to dispute that but they locked the card and cant even reverse the payment until its processed. Well what the fuck! We are running super late make it to the doc with literally 4 min to spare. 

I'm hungry at this point went to bed hungry woke up hungry and still hungry but we make my appointment. I get seen right away, but it doesn't go well, doc wants me to go to the hospital because my BP readings are high. So I am already upset by this, worried about being induced again, I'm only 28 weeks + 5 days, I had my son at 32 weeks and he was in the NICU for 2 weeks and I did not want to have to go through that again. Doctor tells me to calm down, and said let's listen to the baby. 

He tries for 10 minutes and cant find her heartbeat. I am now in full blown panic mode, and need to have an emergency ultrasound, but had to wait 20-30 minutes, needless to say I cried the whole time, and dont think I was breathing most of the time. They do the ultrasound she is okay. 

We leave grab lunch and go home and rest, and then around 9pm leave to go get roommates from work. Need to go to Walmart to get pull ups and some necessities, had a $50.00 rewards card to use, but it doesn't work. I lost it, in the middle of the store. 

It's now after midnight and I'm done. Emotionally drained physically exhausted. I suffer from depression and anxiety and tonight I just am at an end. I dont want to do this anymore.

The sad truth,"I tried a dating site recently and found someone nice. She was gregarious and open and we got it off at first.
After a week we were intimate and it was very nice to feel that again after so long. But sadly I began to notice certain pitfalls that were looming ahead. The sad fact is I'm older and don't have the stamina I once had. Bring intimate more than two maybe three times in a week would be my best and I could clearly feel she was interested in more. 
It also opened a new floodgate of emotions I was ill prepared for as well as financial issues that I just couldn't afford to date properly. The overwhelming pushed me into a mini depression as it was clear I am unable to date and will be alone. We broke up shortly after.
It was a sad Revelation, but I am trying to find some inner peace to accept my situation. I read in a book how the human body used to be much more accepting of being alone, but modern society has (at least me) into a almost desperation to be accepted by others for self worth. I really want to seek within me for self acceptance and maybe, hopefully, I can find some serenity and sanity throughout my Autumn years and into the winter of my Life. ",depression

What is it i am looking for on this site,"I appreciate this site a lot but it does not make any significant difference to me as far as I can tell.  I like my friends here and appreciate their support a lot.  But as far as my mood and outlook and life and health, it is only getting worse.  I don't expect an online site to change that but then, why am I here?  I do like to chat with people here but it won't lead to any relationships in the real world which, I think, is what I need.
I feel more and more disconnected from people and life and hope as time goes on.  My life is so painful i almost find it extraordinary that anyone could live and survive as i have so long term and then i wonder what the point of my existence is.  I'm not raising kids, i'm not good at my job and i don't like it, i seem to annoy and bother most people i meet, my family doesn't like me, i feel no true happiness or security or hope.  '
the despair and loneliness i feel i wouldn't wish on anyone.  and this is life.  I mean, it's shocking.  and yet it goes on.  of course i have often thought of dying, passing away peacefully is what i would like, to be released from this bondage of pain.  but that doesn't happen.  and a violent way of going by my own hand, i don't seem to possess the nerve nor believe in going down that path.
so what's left.  kind of this gawking at my own pain, like, really?  this is it?  this is how bad it's going to feel and worse until the end?
i don't understand happiness.  I think there are happy people but i don't even know what that means.  I don't understand how anyone could be happy in a world like this, knowing what the world is.
did i feel this bad when i was young?  sometimes yes i guess but it was different because there was a lot of time ahead so it seemed more hopeful that i've have time to figure it out.  now, everything seems so absolute and dismall.
what could be good if everything and everyone we love, including ourselves, ends in death anyway?

Relationship trouble,"Hi, I’m not sure where to begin really.. I’ve been with my boyfriend over 3 years now and for the past year I haven’t been so happy. I’ve felt quite alone and under appreciated I guess. But also for the past year my boyfriend has been asking me to do things with other guys as this is something he enjoyed. He kept asking for a long time before I started talking to other guys and so on. I didn’t have the guts to tell him I hadn’t been happy as anytime I brought up how I felt (unless it was positive) he would never hear me out.  I also didn’t want to disappoint him at the same time so I chatted to others and sent pictures etc whilst letting him know, which he did enjoy. After nearly a year had passed I almost went to meet somebody, that my bf knew and wanted me to meet, but eventually didn’t. I then went on a weekend away to Germany with friends where he asked me to get with someone and tell him about it when I got home. That weekend I went out with friends and got quite drunk and met a guy. We danced for a while and kissed and he walked me back to my hotel. He came in with me and we did things together, but didn’t sleep with each other. He then fell asleep in the bed next to me. I woke an hour or so after as I had to be up early (stupid to go out the night before I know), and tried to wake him. My bf rang me twice which I didn’t answer to as I felt a little guilty for actually having done it, but thought that’s what he wanted. When I got home and told him he liked the idea at first, but when I told him it wasn’t one of my friends that it was with and it was someone from over there that I’d only known the night he got super upset and we fought. I’ve apologised profusely but also got mad at him for making me feel like I had to do it and then getting upset at me, my head was being pulled apart really with the conflicting emotions. I understand that he is upset about it not being someone I knew and went with, I feel so bad and regretful about that. I’ve never felt so disgusting and alone and it’s so hard for the both of us. I’m not sure if this will get any responses as it’s so long, as well I don’t know what people would even think about this. I guess I just needed to get it out there as I don’t have anyone close I can share this with. Apologies I have written so much, writing it all down has helped me so thank you. ",depression
My poetry the title is fly,"I'm like a fly  
I'm in your house 
You tell me I'm  uninvited  
I'm  eating with you 
You tell me 
What are you doing here?
Why are you here ?
I want to spend some time with you  
You say your busy 
You stay away
I tell you I miss you 
You never tell me you miss me too.
You say your doing what's best for me 
But your doing what's best for you 
You push me away
Because of my emotions  for you
I want to be part your life 
You don't want me too
You always say you still love me the same 
As I'm your real grandaughter but I don't feel it that much 
I feel pain 
Pain 
I'm just fly 
I'm your opinion and in life  not even an option .
I'm so easy to be thrown away 
In the garbage I stay 
The garbage truck takes me in
And takes my pain away 
Thank you now that im flying  in my grave

"One side pulls down, the other makes me do pushups","I could just wilt into depression today, there are negative thoughts that come back. I look at them and deliberately scoff at them and push them away. Occasionally ""Why don't you just kill yourself"" comes in, but I pay it no mind. It is an echo of past intense long-term undiagnosed depression. I am on meds now and have had therapy and all that, I have learned to manage the thoughts better.
But everyday life can tick off my brain into the pits, if I am caught off guard by the past ruts I fell into. I am struggling today, but I have hope that I will keep stepping back, and saying WAIT!! This is the brain disease, not me. Don't add insult to injury by paying attention to self-hate thoughts. Those do not belong there, I do not not want them!! They are echoes from the past and from words I heard directed at me by hateful people and bad memories.

"Feeling awful, useless and a total failure","Well I’m 66 years old with multiple myeloma (cancer) and this terrible dread hanging over me for the last 3 weeks. Been depressed on and off since teenage years. Right now the cancer is in check but has caused serious bone problems and I need a full hip replacement. This has caused me to not be able to work or even walk more than about 25 steps without a crutch. Since diagnosis in 2017 I have turned so inward that I don’t even communicate with my wife or family. I just feel totally alone despite a loving family. Friends well I have shut them off. It’s not just the cancer. I feel like a failure in life and there is no second time around at 66. I’m not suicidal but it has crossed my mind at times. I am on social security and worry about money all the time even though we pay all our bills and have no debt and a house paid for as well. I do get out a little to go to the store and it just seems like the whole world is doing good except me. Not being able to work even a little has made me feel useless. Not having a big nest egg has made me feel like a failure. Just didn’t plan right I guess, but during the last 25 years we had to help our adult kids and grand kids and that took a ton of money. I worry if the cancer comes back the medical bills could bankrupt us. Just so much constant worry. And if that’s not enough we have an adult daughter and 2 grandkids that also live with us and no sign of her getting ahead and being on her own. I will say the grandkids 7 and 8 now are the only joy I get out of life. They have been with us for 5 years now. I would do anything for these grandkids. But it takes a toll in that I feel like I’m the safety net for them and not feeling very good about myself.i could write another couple of hundred words but what for",depression

not feeling good today,"everything is just getting on top of me. i just feel so low, there is nothing to look forward to just more of the same but i will be older.
my son has taken a job and took it for granted that i will watch his children. my husband is so nice to everyone else but then takes it out on me as he does not want to watch the children. what does he expect me to do. my dog is end of his life, everyday is a struggle with him. he wakes me at least twice a night to go out. i love him so much but am exhausted. when i think of having him put to sleep i cant stand the pain. it hurts in my heart.
i work long hours as it is and now have more childcare to do. i love my grandchildren but at my age i want some freedom. is that too much to ask ? but on the other hand i want to help my son. 
i love animals and am involved in lost of charities, i am becoming so worn down by the emails about the cruelty that is happening every day, every minute to defenseless animals. it just does my head in , i cant stand it. i do what i can by donating and campaigning but it is just getting me so low. i feel like i over empathise as i imagine what they all feel like and i cant stand what is in my head.  
there seems no way out of this, if my husband accidentially touches me when we are in bed, he moves away. i feel repulsive. he wont even try to resolve things. i asked him for a divorce but he didnt answer and fell asleep. says it all really.......

Insurance sucks...,"Why is insurance such a stupid system? Out of the entire healthcare system, can't insurance just be overhauled so everyone is equal?
Including the Medicaid system.

It's so dumb, I just want to be able to go to the doctor, and to my therapist. I have a bit to talk about when it comes to healthcare and this stupid insurance crap. I recently got married, which kind of opens up a special window to change benefits and such, which I went and applied for Medicaid since I am low income. I just got a letter back telling me that I qualify for Medicaid, but that in order to use it I have to spend like $900 a month. The whole reason that I am applying for it is so that I can get off the work insurance and stop paying an extra $200 a month that I could use to do other things in my life (like saving up money so I can bring my son out for a visit next summer, or even trying to get him a phone line because his father doesn't think it is a requirement to keep up a phone line.)
The current work insurance requires a deductible, which guess what, I cannot afford. Come on, I am the sole financial provider for a family of five, and I pay child support for my son. I feel like I have no money at all. Sure my bills get paid, but I have to ignore my own health because I can't even afford to go get tested to find out if I do have endometriosis, I can't afford to go to my therapist and actually work on the traumas. I can't even afford to fix my car.  
And then the stupid and annoying commercials about we don't want government health care because it means higher taxes. How many people actually know how much they pay in taxes?
It shouldn't be about government healthcare versus private paid insurance. It should just be healthcare. It should be a right, not a choice.",depression

I woke up this morning with one thought on my mind: ""I should just end this."" I honestly don't see the point in continuing and I don't have anyone around me that would be devestated or heartbroken in my absence. I quit my job a few days ago because the overwhelming feeling of ""I can't do this, I'm not good enough"" made the thought of being in public where people could see me so trying that I just wanted to go home and break down. I burst into tears everytime I think about continuing this way and I'm seriously contemplating committing suicide. I'm not sure what it is that I need to break out of this, but I thought maybe venting to a group of people that understands mights be worth a shot.

There's this void in me I cannot fill and I want an answer to what it is. I thought having some insight to myself would allow me to improve.

Long Distance hasn't worked in the past and im terrified the same thing will happen again. it feels like she doesnt care about me or what i have to say. the same applies to my family and friends; my family is always gone and there is never food to eat before my shifts, my friends are never available and dont check on me.

"""sucker"" tattoo --- communication breakdown...","No, really, I don't have a tattoo like that on my forehead.  I think it's ""looser"" instead.
Why is it, some people look at you and see what they want, or see what they think they see.  Yeah, it's all the same shit as that old saying, which is older than my own Baby Boomer generation: ""You can't tell a book by its cover..."" 
I've seen some really cool ""art work"" before and as a hypocrite, I suppose, I accepted the cover art, only to find I was wrong.
Way back, I also called it ""gift wrap""...oh such pretty paper and a bow...only to find the ""gift"" was horrible.
I am getting so tired of people looking at me, seeing me as somebody they want to avoid, because I don't LOOK like what they would accept. I have no gift wrap, my cover art is just me, a Baby Boomer hippy looking character...white beard and all.  I dress in rock-n-roll t-shirts and jeans and have for over forty years...but it seemed so much easier back then to be accepted by others. Not anymore though.
Not to generalize or stereotype here: when I lived in Sacramento California, or even down south in California...I really didn't look much different from others, yet people STILL saw the cover art and saw somebody to avoid.  Sure sometimes I have a brain-to-mouth communication problem but it's not some mental condition, well, other than interverance from chronic migraines.  When your brain is in constant pain...it's hard to think, much less communicate in a logical, reasonable fashion.
Hey folks, I DO have a brain, I am a logical, reasonable person...I am an arm-chair philosophy type, so what mine is a little bit odd, we are ALL a little bit odd.  We all have our own beliefs and the like, sometimes what we think or believe mesh with others---sometimes it doesn't...and SOMETIMES there are some of us who, because of health issues, like chronic migraines, have problems with concentration and communication.
Fuck, folks...I'm just me, a person unlucky enough to have these health issues, something you can't SEE...and if you can't SEE them, then there MUST be something wrong with me, mentally, right?

And collapsed and was readmitted due to unresolved bp issues and protien in my urine. Said I had post partum preeclampsia. Took me months to get my bp under control (never had bp issues prior to pregnancy) 

Fast forward to now, e,extremely rough pregnancy, HG at week 7, hospital visits, meds, and still miserable. Put on light bedrest at week 14, put on sticker bedrest at week 23, and yesterday at 25 week doc visit put on strick bedrest, I can go from the bed to the bathroom, from the bathroom to the couch. I'm going stir crazy. I am having a hard time dealing. I feel like a failure right now. It's hard to take care of my family. I cant cook or clean, I feel like my son is suffering and I'm so worried about how my health is affecting my daughter. 

I've suffered from depression and anxiety disorders since I was a teen but I'm off my meds and it's really taking a toll on me :( I just want this to get better, I know it won't till after I have my daughter but I'm just a wreck. I cant sleep and that's making it worse I think. 

I still have 13 weeks to go, I'm bored out of my mind, I'm bored with the tv, I just cant seem to keep my mind from wandering, and now I've had to accept that I wont be able to have a baby shower because A) bedrest B) money and C) no one wants to help me plan one or host one.

Where were you on September 11th 2001.,"Where were you on 911? It is a question that has been asked for the past 6573 days. It is a question that has been asked for the past 18 years. It something that will always remain with us. I suspect when we are in our late ages, its something that we will still remember. I was 12 years old when it happened. I was in middle school. I remember being in history class when the 1st tower went down. We were living in Connecticut when it happened. Connecticut is not far from New York, a few hour drive. I will always remember that day, down to what I was wearing, and what we had for dinner. I remember seeing the coverage on television in school. I remember that school got out early that day, I went down the street to the elementary school, and got my brother, who also had an early release, and we walked home together. I remember us both getting grounded, because we were outside playing when my mom got home. She came home early, because she had been calling the house and we didn't answer. We had Costco Pizza for dinner, because dad brought it home from work. We stayed up late watching TV coverage, and we stayed home for the rest of the week. It is something that I will always remember.

I find out through my mom he has been diagnosed with it . I feel so bad for him , that Christmas I get a switch, school comes back AND HES BACK , it was just for a few months ,not much , I tell him about my switch , his s hair was growing back , it was short and thin ( not the long thick hair he had) , he was in a wheel chair .we have cancer fundraisers ,he’s the subject of all of them . We have this thing called mini thon( like Penn states thon, a massive fundraiser for Four Diamonds) in May.

Summer passes, and he visits band camp but can’t do it. The year passes, and we do more things at our school for him . then we graduate, AND HE GRADUATES, we get pictures together. Summer and fall pass and in late April(this year) I do thon for my college I make a lantern for him for his fight, and for three other people who have cancer and the two who survived, the other passed earlier this year, and I missed class for it. My college year ends on an ok note. Summer passes, I hear through friends he’s doing poorly. Then just this Saturday he dies in his sleep I find out through my parents. I AM DEVASTATED. This man was someone I considered as a brother, friend, even crush .goddamit cancer is a bitch
can someone help me on here? I don’t know how to deal with the pain .i never lost someone this close to me, except my great-grandma. I never lost someone this close to me in age too, only older and younger. ",depression
My life is just crumbling apart,"I really don't know what to say.  I feel better since I came back from my counselor this afternoon but honestly my life went from OK and even feeling motivated and optimistic in the early summer to total disaster and depression now by labor day. After much deliberation in the Spring, I left a job that was really difficult.  I enrolled back in school and seemed to be doing well in the classes. I'm a teacher so I thought that I would find another contract here for the fall as I finished my coursework.
My life has since become dismantled. I had a routine procedure in mid-July that did not go well and I became very sick. This put off the job hunt a little. My insurance ended just about exactly one month ago.  I had five interviews from late July to now, and not one offer. I'm running out of money.  At this time, there was a sudden turnaround in my schooling, the tutor that was grading my work and saying that I was doing well handed it off to the professor above her, who disagreed with the evaluation.  I went from getting 4/4 on all my assignments and received a zero. (on the exact same assignment) I would have to go back and redo it all but here's the problem...since I can't find a fulltime job I won't even be able to pay for the tuition. I asked if I could put the online program on hold and then come back to it, with the saved work that I have...she said that they can't pause it.  I don't know if my earlier work will be saved. 
In the short time that I haven't had insurance, I had a major medical emergency, I had an unexpected anaphalactic reaction to something and the paramedics were here. I had to pay full price to replace my epi pens-the dr. that I saw just would not follow up and fill out the paperwork for free epi-pens without insurance. I emailed...called..nothing.  I could not go without epi pens. So I had to rush like mad and then pay full price. It is so dangerous. Unexpectedly in this time, I went into menopause, I was a little surprised, but it hit me so hard that I just don't sleep through  full night, feel totally different, and had to pay out of pocket for hormone replacement and a visit because it had such a sudden and dramatic impact on me.  In just a short time, I'm racking up huge medical bills.
Some of my friends don't understand. I keep isolating myself because I have nothing positive to add right now, and to be honest, one friend who I already feel strained with...the balance is suddenly being pushed over.  In the past year or so all she does is criticize my profession relentlessly, just constant criticism and judgment. The criticism and judgment are just relentless and endless.  I guess it's difficult to be around me lately but she has no idea...they thought I was actually allergic to the hormone replacement and that's what did it. I asked her if she could empathize or had gone through anything similar. You could tell she was just totally checked out and disgusted.  I think many of her other relationships have hit the skids due to her extreme criticism. One of her friends that was a teacher, my friend would just argue and insist to her that ""yes you do have money."" I could only imagine how she felt. Oddly, they are not talking anymore. It doesn't seem to matter what it is, if I say I have some kind of limitation or anything, say I'm not available to drive, try to set limits, there is no listening, it's just a huge brick wall.  If I say I can't drive, she says ""yes you can"". She just argues, forces and insists. Nothing matters.  She's invited us to spend another weekend away with her. I wont' be able to take it. She'll scream and insist that I have money, even when I'm unemployed.  I've had it to my limit with the judgments. And my patience is especially thin now.
I honestly don't know what to do. The reason I went back to school was to improve my situation, and now it looks like I might have to drop out of school. I don't want to do this.  My support group has gone straight to hell.  All the people there just argue and most of them are just trying to squeeze the last bit out of me-money, time, rides, no matter how destitute my situation is or how bad it is. I only have respect for my counselor and that's about it.  I just sat here sobbing my brains out when I finally got my epi pens yesterday, I can't live without them.
I don't know if anyone here believes in spirituality or something like that.  I know that some people believe in law of attraction, or that god helps people, but it just doesn't seem to be working at all. I need really serious help, I need medical care and a doctor.",depression

when it is least expected,"Today wasn't really bad. As most days start out, I guess.  I often wake up with a sour outlook like: ""Oh shit, another day, all I want to do is sleep forever..."" but it never happens. I have sleep issues as is, chronic insomnia, I guess from harsh stress, severe depression and whatever anxiety I have going.
I really don't like where I am living, its in a very small community, if you can call it that. It's at the bottom of an area in Texas, a very old area, known as The Big Thicket. Little places like this are from out of time.  Not modern or anything like that. I'd dare say hillbilly like and I am out of place because I am a ""hippy"". or so that is what they call me. I am a baby boomer, with beliefs and philosophical outlooks and they are just...well, not.
Yes it is true, I want to sleep forever. That would solve my issues of being alone and wondering about my ""wife""...and having these good memories come into my head and instead of making me feel good, they just make me sad.  And then having bad memories and what happened to us, to her, to me, because of her---makes me angry.  Where I am living, makes me angry.
I would like a whole day without these damn issues. But I don't see that coming, at all.
To make matters all the worse, I am 63, basically homeless, isolated AND financially destitute...trying to get Social Security to give me my money...yeah, one day.  When it is too late and I am dead, that would make SS and some others really happy.",depression
can't sleep,"my life is an effing mess.  i'm up too late.  can't sleep.  the stress is winning.  the despair and hopeless have crowded out any positive feelings, in fact, i can't remember the last time i enjoyed anything, really, or felt happy.  i keep going on but it's the march of a destroyed person just barely getting through the motions. i feel sad that this is my life.  i feel sad that this is the best i can do and is probalby in fact my destiny.  i wanted to be thin and pretty and attract men and have fun but that just isn't real, i'm fat and ugly and repulsive to men.  i wanted to have an interesting meaningful life but i don't.  i feel like a worthless piece of crap.  it's not even that i feel that way about myself, it's that I am that in society. all i really am is a menial laborer who could so easily be replaced.  the world wouldn't miss me at all if I was gone.  I'm not suicidal, i'm just saying as a fact, that if i was not here, it wouldn't matter.  i have to go to sleep.  i'm so tired.  ",depression
Is it true or not?,"Every time, I go to school; I feel like I'm invisible, the teachers make me feel that way. If I raise my hand and they're doing nothing, they just overlook(I don't know if I used that word right) it and I just put my hand back down. For example, today, I was in my English class and there is this program that I needed, that had the updated form of the prompt to do my new essay with. I told my teacher about it and she never gave me the log in or anything After I clearly told her that I couldn't get into the program, did the same thing at the end of the class, but it was at the time the bell rang, and I needed to go to my other class and just thought to forget about it. Earlier in the class, she gave classwork that consisted of working in groups, she told me to look for someone to work with, I went up to this girl, and I went around and asked groups if they did the assignment, and everyone said no because no one did it. I saw this girl and asked if she wanted to work together, she said no, because she was revising someone else's paper. So, I ended up working alone. I tried to hold back my tears. I went to my second class and everything was fine, I just read manga, after finishing all my work. Went to my third class, went well too. My fourth class was the WORST. I had to sign up for this testing thing, I didn't know how to do it and I didn't understand the directions; I went to ask my teacher for help, but she just gave me SOME directions and I figured the rest out of my own, even if it took a long time. After that, I went to ask her for a job (Because that's how you earn credits in the class) and she ignored me for about 5 minutes. I was just standing there, waiting for her to give me something. She finally gave me my job and I went to do it. The bell rang and my day got better. Out of 10, this was a score of 5 bad days. I've had worse. I would sometime raise my hand and wait till they've noticed me, which would usually end up in a long wait or just embarrassing myself and putting my hand down. Sometimes, I would just stand next to them until they would notice me. I don't wish to be the most noticeable kid in the classes or something. I just need a little guidance like teachers are supposed to do. Just offer me help when I need it. :(

Hello,"I have not been here in along time but I have been down for awhile. I have a history of major depression and I'm alcoholic with long term sobriet.
There is a lot of situational stuff and I'm at point in my life where I can't fix it, in some cases I can't ever fix it. I've rebounded many times in my life but I always felt like there were things I could do to make it better long term. One example is my failing body which is letting me down. My knees are shot and I love the outdoors and cannot lose/control weight without activity. Activity is also one of the few healthy ways I had of coping.

Back to School,"I went back to school on the 22nd and I am very very depressed. During the summer, I don't have to worry about being in a sea of people and I don't have to worry about being ignored by just about everyone. I can stay home and not have to deal with too many people and mentally wear myself out.
But now I'm back to being so invisible that the girl sitting next to me didn't even know I was there untill I sneezed, being surrounded by so many people that I'm being shoved around and hearing so many sounds all at once that I feel like hiding in a bathroom stall and covering my ears until it all goes away.

"every day on a personal basis, I am on suicide wat","I don't know what happened. It was just totally outside my understanding. I will try to discribe it at a later time.  
I don't exist anymore.  I refer to myself, inside my brain as ""King of the Walking Dead"" but not related to that idiot tv series, that is just how I feel.  I am dead inside.  The only true emotion which is alive is depression...severe depression. I have never been this bad before.  It seems to all be based on...hell...I can't explain it because I don't understand it.
Right now I am doing what my dad called, ""White knuckling"" it.  There is no happiness in my life.  There is nothing in my life.
Though I sort of have family around me, my oldest refuses to understand the cause of this, she thinks I am crazy, she thinks I am defending my wife, she doesn't understand she isn't and wasn't my wife.  After at least three months (out of probably six), living with the one I dubbed Vihane, she was so angry and hateful---she got rid of me, well a combination of real-me and, well, here we go, I feel I need to explain, but I won't, not right now.  There was the real-me, who I am as I exist in this reality, then there's the ""other-me"", the one who exists in what she called ""the other place""---it's like a mirror-world, existing together at the same time.  Lord I wish I could explain it but since I wasn't inside her head, I really don't know how she saw it.
I'm going to skip a lot, get to the point, for today.
Since June 22,2019, when I was done away with by Vihane...I have been totally miserable. Life is just so f'n empty. I am a ""ghost"" if you will.  I don't exist.  I used to think my wife and I just ""survived"" life for the last three years, since we were homeless (will explain later).  But now?  Those last three years of ""surviving"" was just a suberb of hell---I am in hell.
It's a day-to-day thing now.  I've never been severely depressed.  You call this life? I call it fucking hell.

Mum-mum's 91st Bday Yesterday,"So yesterday, was my grandmom's (Mum-mum) birthday. I went to the cemetery and sat next her plot and told her how much I loved her, spoke to her, read poetry and inspirational material, told her about things going on in the present. But it never gets any easier. I was a fuckin' mess and I feel depleted and a mess today. But without all the constant tears. I always have a hard time when it comes to visiting her. I started this new therapy group, DBT. Right now, we're doing 1 hr sessions, 1 day a week for 8 weeks. It's an introduction/orientation to see if we want to commit ourselves into being in a 2 hrs., 2 days a week for a year. It's a very intense program. You have to be committed and present. They have a high success rate. So I'm hoping it helps. I'm super depressed right now. I'm so resentful, I'm so angry right now. I'm so angry with my brother, he didn't even respond to goin to the cemetery to see my grandma. I texted, I sent a video message, no response! I have so much anger and resentment toward my husband. So much, that I wanna move out but being on SSDI, it's hard to just move out cause you're on a fixed income. Not that we live in the most expensive neighborhood, but it still a little expensive. I can move in with people I know but the thing is, when you're horribly depressed and you're isolating, you don't wanna be bothered with people. You really don't wanna move in with anyone else, I'd rather stay where the hell I am. He is not very supportive, he doesn't understand what I'm going through, he makes me angry a lot, he says things to get under my skin, etc.and  He is not the man I thought he was gonna be. It's like when I met him he was trying to be like this awesome person but then as time went on, I mean he does have good qualities but like when it comes to showing empathy and sensitivity for someone with mental illness, he doesn't know shit or how to act. He doesn't know how to do things or say things to not trigger me. And he seems to always do something to trigger me or he loses his own temper and his own shit over stupid things, and I do mean very stupid things because he has not come to term and dealt with his own past issues. I find myself always wanting to hurt him physically in some way or I just don't want him here. I don't know. I let y'all know how therapy goes tomorrow. This is my 3rd session. Hugs to all!!",depression
if...,"One bad day after another. They all pile atop each other, weighint me down.
I am not sure how long I can exist like this: in emotional pain, severe depression and being this alone.
There has been only two women I have been totally in love with. Yes I have been married three times, but the first two, well there is a story there but I won't tell it. My third wife, I was totally in love with. She was totally in love with me. Eleven years of a wonderful life and then, in a really strange way, she was gone.
The ""first"" one I was in love with I met after I was in college, well, not IN college, I was forced out. I was 23, I think, she was about a year younger. Is ""love at first sight"" really true? I think so. We were.
We had a four month relationship, it was, well, wonderful. I never felt so close to a woman. We were devoted to each other. Time spent with her was heaven. I even asked her to marry me when she graduated from college in six months. 
We had an issue about something. Her father was an asshole. When I met him, I could tell he hated me. I was a hippy, he didn't like that at all.  When he found out his daughter was engaged to me, he went totally ballistic, saying horrible things to me and his daughter. Once back to the little town we lived in, on the six hour drive back, we had our first and only arguement. It wasn't a good scene.
Someting inside of me went stupid a couple of days later. Yes, there was this other girl, I hardly knew her, we had spoken a few times in the lobby of the dorm. I ran into her and she heavily flrited wih me. Later that night we ended up having sex.
Now see, my girlfriend was a virgin and even though we had heavy foreplay, she always backed out of making love. Her Catholic mother had convienced her, since she was a virgin, the first time would be a lot of horrible pain. I knew she wanted to make love, she said enough about it, we talked about it and yet we would frequently end up in bed, having pleasure but no making love.
I was weak.
From guilt, I kind of distanced myself from my GF for a while, trying to sort out things. We got together a few times and then, so suddenly...and I hadn't even seen it coming, our relationship just stopped.  There was confusion between us, mistakes were made, our paths were messed up. I missed a date with her, not because I wanted to, it just happen, something out of my control. Two days later I wrote her a letter explaing things and asked her to meet me in front of the university library so we could talk things out. Her asshole roommate, she didn't give her the letter, she never knew I wanted to work things out and get back together. When she didn't show up, I thought she didn't want to try. It broke my heart to think she had read the letter and decided not too. I broke her heart because she thought I had left her. It was all a big mess.
Over the next forty years, I frequently thought of her, even being married to the 2nd wife and being totally in love with my true love of eleven years. A human being, when they have found their soul mate and then lost them, NEVER forgets, no matter what.
Open my return to Texas, I found her on Facebook. I took a chance and wrote her. I even put in a friend request. Two days later she accepted. For the last two months, she has come to my page, she has left notes to me, we have sort of communicated. I asked her for  chance to meet and talk. I suppose she came up with a valid reason to put it off, but I'm not sure. She never lied to me, so why now? We exchanged a couple of emails but that was it. Two days ago she was on Messernger and wanted to finally chat but I didn't, at that time, so I did send her one back. Since then she has been silent to my request to chat.
Over the past couple of months, I have posted certain music videos on my FB. I have even tagged her on some of them. They express how I feel about her. Now I KNOW she still loves me, I can tell. And I KNOW the feeling is mutual.
It's like the song by Cheap Trick...""The Flame""...it has never gone away for either one of us.
WHY would she accept my friend request, made a few remarks and then ask to chat if SOMETHING is not still there after fourty years?
All I want is a chance to explain, a chance to tell her about my letter, that there was a communication issue because of her cold hearted roommate.
I can't help my feelings for her. Love like this, even after forty years, just doesn't go away. I know they haven't for her. 
It's like she is either afraid of what might happen if we were to get together, even for the first time, or she is too scared to admit to her feelings...or, she is torturing me.  I just don't know.
This is making me craay, depressed. I know she is lonely and would meet after forty years, maybe she doesn't want the horrid hurt be  piled onto.  But...I know there is this deep love between us, it never died.
And here I am, near the point of no return.
I need her in my life. I know she needs me too. If a couple are soul-mates and something happens to split them up...not even time, like forty years can break that connection.
I am lost.
With these feelings added to my depression...and not knowing what is going on...and no view of a future, I often think about checking out of the hotel, without ever knowing what the true possibilties for us might be.",depression
Checking in,"I’ve been stable. Not in crisis. 
However there is no joy. No hope.

My relationship is touchy. He’s intense and aggressive. There is no sex or affection. I am disappointed and unhappy. I stay because he is company. I have space for my animals that bring me more enjoyment than anything else. I think about my own place but the thought of change scares me. 
I had annual visit with my psychiatrist in July. We lowered my Lexapro dose to try to help with my weight. So far no good. 
I pretty much never feel  good  I stopped confiding in friends about my woes as it only alienated me from them. I just say I’m fine  nobody want to hear the bad stuff even if they ask.  
My doc asked if I think about suicide  and I hesitated  because I don’t want to get committed. But I think about it. Yes. I dont want to hurt my family and leave my animals without care.  
So i have been riding my bike.  Trying to worry less about my weight.  Eat healthy foods. Not burden others with my shit  they say the care and want to know but really they don’t

Struggling with CP as an Adult,"Hey all,
My name is Kelly and I am 27 years old. I was born with Cerebral Palsy and use an electric wheelchair as my main source of mobility, but I can walk with a cane as well. I have posted in this group before, but to be honest, it's been quite awhile. Essentially, I've just been feeling really down about myself and my disability lately. I always try to keep a positive attitude about things, but it's been hard as of late. In May of 2018, I graduated with my Masters in History from a respected university in IL. Since then, I have come back home to live with my parents and apply to jobs. Part of my frustrations stem from my unsuccessful job search. I've applied to so many over the past year and a half, I've lost count. I can't help but think my disability has something to do with me not getting these jobs (in some cases I know that to be true). Anyway, even though I'm continuously applying, I've found myself kind of resolving to the fact that I have nothing going on in my life lately. I am a social person. I have plenty of friends and a large family, but I essentially do nothing day in and day out. It has been impossible for me to stay positive when I'm surrounded by people who are doing things I want to be doing. Getting married, working, moving out, etc. I'm not sure how much longer I can stay comfortable with what is happening in my life.
It's not only the unsuccessful job search or my friends doing things that has me upset lately. I know this is ridiculous, but whenever I picture myself in my head, I'm never in a wheelchair. I never have a disability. The same was true for whenever I pictured my future as well. However, now that I'm actually ""in"" my future, I'm realizing how drastically different it is from the one I had pictured in my head. I'm sorry for being so negative. I guess I just wanted to express my feelings in an avenue to people who would understand. I'd love to hear similar stories from people who overcome similar feelings/situations as well please. Thank you for listening :)",depression

Feeling Completely Useless,"Next month, we won't have enough money to pay our bills and rent. I have been looking and applying for jobs but because of my lack of experience and self confidence, I always end up not getting the job.

We posted side job ads everywhere we can find, in this small town we live in (even extending it to the next town) but we only got responses from curious people :( I'm at a loss here and I really refuse to ask for money from family, yet again.
My mom got really frustrated with our current situation and said things like, how is it possible that your life gets worse by the year where everyone else is doing better? You both must be really lazy people, you're not striving hard enough etc etc. I've been so upset by her comments and she's the type of person who does not respect boundaries or try to understand you. People have asked me to stop talking to her (since she wouldn't stop when you tell her to) to save my own sanity, but I just couldn't. I'm not on speaking terms with my father and my sister, and my mom is the only person that I communicate with, and I still love her very much. At this point, I'm literally lying to her that we're working and we don't have any problem, because it is the only way to shut her up.

Scary (trigger),"Id been questioning my involvement in a support group for a long while now and i think the straw broke the camels back big time. I quit my job due to extremely negative atmosphere in june...im still interviewing. Did four interviews did not get any of them. Im freaking out and blaming myself for the outcome. Im a teacher so i felt like i waited too long (mid july) to start application process. Anyway my real point here is that the ""support"" group im in has become reallu messed up. One person i was leaning into to for support just to chat has turned ugly really fast. She always struck me as super controlling and dominating and i was getting scared of her. A couple of times she raised her voice and it definitely seemed like she wanted me to cut off contact with everyone else in my life. I got more and more scared and started to run away from her. One day she texted me that her family member committed suicide. I felt bad but was not of much help as depression is one of my main issues and really triggering. I apologized that i could not be there more and offered my condolences. It was not good enough. More phone calls and demands to just hang out all day were coming in. I put in some breahing space. Next thing i know the next catastrophe hits: couple of weeks later shes mysteriously in an epic head on collision, cant work or do anything. I came over one day to just help out a bit. She claimed he person who hit her was a blackout drink (but she has been an alcoholic). How would yo7 know this? Blood alcohol levelnwas not confirmed....she seemed also a little too happy after the recent suicide...wanted me to immediately join her to party a couple days later. Then she asked me if i could help her to work a one day job and use my car. The agreement was that i could help her out til she got a job.  I have another interview come up so i let her know ""hey just wanted to let u know head of time so u can fill that day slot. I have to interview for a position. Maybe be able to assist u with an erand this weekend. The agreement wasna tentative one, but she responded with rage and indignance and demanded i drop my interview for a fulltime position to accommodate her day gig. She was very nasty and demanded i call her and tried to argue me out of going to the interview. She has alienated ppl before acting likenhis even prior fo these hardships. Its only intensifying. Frankly im scared t9 death. Something tells me she may have driven i nto traffic on purpose. Its not every day u are hit head on you almost have to try to drive the wrong way. Also she is so thrilled to go use the gun at he shooting range that her relative usedm she seems maniacally happy to do it. Im gonna run as far and fast as i can.

meds,"so I'm pretty sure the meds I am taking aren't working any more,  I've taken prozac, and am now on seroquel, trazadone, and cymbalta.  I don't think the cymbalta is doing much for me any more",depression
I think this may be the last straw...,"my life has been nothing but sadness... like everything bad that you could think of has legit happened... now I’m dealing with the fact my 4 year old was sexually abused by my husbands friend we thought we could trust.... like at this point I can’t even live with the fact that this happened to my innocent child.. I can’t eat, sleep or even look at my baby without crying... before this I always suffered with depression but like now I feel like I have a elephant on my chest... we are couch surfing & my children are so traumatized... I just need some words of wisdom & no judgement... I’m so broken... I don’t know If i have the strength when my babies need me the most right now ... I literally feel numb. I’m so broken.. after everything that has happened I’m like how again is this life worth it? There’s so much foulness, evilness & no good... I’m like why would I want to live anymore in a world that snatched the innocence of my baby??? How is this life worth it?! I’m ready to go... & take my kids with me. This world doesn’t deserve my angel. ",depression
I don't know what to do with my life,"Hello all.
I am new to this site and I hope I am posting in the right place. I am in need some some advice and insight. 
I am 28, soon to be 29 and I earned my bachelor's degree in graphic design 4 years ago. I have been married for 8 years and I have quite literally no other family than my husband due to a dysfunctional and abusive family dynamic. 
When I was growing up, everyone told me that I needed to go to college at any cost, no matter what it would take and that it didn't matter what I studied - just to get a degree so I could succeed in a career and make enough money to support myself. Long story short, my father, whom I have not spoken to in 9 years now, stole every last cent of the money that my adoptive grandfather had set aside for me. When the time came to go to school, my mother and other significant older figures in my life convinced me to take out as many student loans as I needed to go to school. I managed to get some grants and scholarship when I was in school, but they didn't even scratch the surface and now I'm stuck with a worthless degree and over 40k in debt that I am struggling to pay off. 
Right after college, I actually landed a great job which granted me a decent wage and 3 whole weeks of paid vacation each year. The only problem was that it was located in a town and in a state that my husband and I desperately wanted to leave. Also, my husband was not able to find gainful employment there and so we decided to leave. I stayed at my job for a little over two years before my husband found an even better job in an even better state and city. I was ecstatic and felt like things were really coming together.
Once we moved, I was 100% sure I would find another great job, but I was sorely mistaken. After 3 months of job searching every day and night, I found a job in real estate helping with marketing. The pay was lower, less than 2/3rds of what I was making, but I enjoyed the work and the company of my co-workers. Whereas my previous job was all older males, I had people closer to my age to work with and we quickly became friends. Unfortunately, they sold the company and I was laid off after being at that company for just a month. I was devastated as I had never lost a job before and my husband and I had just closed on a house. 
It took 5 painstaking months for me to finally find another job, frantically searching day and night. I was suicidal and and wracked with anxiety and severe insomnia the whole time. I sought help from career centers, temp to hire agencies, and I even paid a resume writer to help me. When I did finaly find a job, my gut reaction was to run far away as the interviewer who offered me the job seemed a bit off. My instincts were correct and I worked for a very low wage with no paid vacation or sick days and this person was verbally abusive not only to me, but other co-workers as well. What made it even worse were the temper tantrums he would throw that would set my PTSD off from when I was abused as a kid. Even though this job made me upset and suicidal, my husband dismissed this as theatrics and refused to let me quit. I was forced to stay at this company for 8 months before I was finally blessed with a wonderful job with a supportive and caring team. 
I've been at my new company doing lower level marketing work and answering phones for just over a year now. The pay is okay, still not what I once had and it's not nearly what I need in order to thrive. The main problem with my new job now is the lack of flexibility. I get one week off at Christmas and just two vacation and two sick days through the rest of the year. I have to show up every day and quite literally all of my co-workers are welcome to come and go from the office or work from home as they please. I feel like I am getting burnt out and my job can be emotionally taxing some days as I have to work with angry and occasionally abusive customers on the daily basis. 
I am just providing this information as a bit of a background. Lately, I have been slipping back into my drinking habits on the weekends and I just feel so unhappy, stretched thin, and exhausted all of the time. I would describe myself to be someone who is just unhappy and I fear I will never be happy. My marriage no longer makes me as happy as it did. I don't feel like I'm in love anymore, even though I do love my spouse. The spark is long gone. I think I'm still angry and feel betrayed by my husband for not protecting me from the abuse I suffered by my previous employer. He never stood up for me or seemed to care about me while my life was crumbling around me and when I wanted so desperately to die. 
I feel tired and scared and stressed out 24/7 and I feel like I failed. I failed in my marriage and in my career. Yes, I achieved my goal of making it through school, but it cost me a great deal. A heap of debt that I worry about each day for a degree I can't use and even given my 10+ years of various job experiences, employers in this new city we live in seemed repelled by me whereas I was almost never turned down before moving. I have no friends and no family. I am very lonely person. I feel like all I do is work and come home to either sleep or veg. out or do housework on the days that I actually feel okay. I am tired. My hobbies have become too stressful to engage in. 
When I think about the future, I see nothing but darkness and more pain ahead of me. I don't know how to socialize, especially when I work constantly and have a house to clean that takes up what little free time I have. I don't know how I can possibly help my marriage and I don't know how to fix my career and move up in the world. I feel like my anxiety constantly holds me back. I don't know what to do and everything feels so bleak. 
If anyone read this and has any advice or helpful words to share, I would greatly appreciate it.",depression
How I'm feeling,"I feel so uncomfortable around people. Whether it be relatives, strangers, etc. . . Everytime I'm near one, I always feel like I am doing something wrong. My mind just keeps telling me that I am a failure, that I'm no good to anyone's eyes. I always fidget with things or try to fix things to make myself seem useful, but I can never have those thoughts out of my head. My heart aches so much when my mind starts to speak. I've tried to ignore it, but I just can't. . .
I went back to school on the 13th that's when things got worse. Because school is very public and it is always sorrounded by strangers, I just don't feel right. Everything in my eyes and possibly everyone's eyes is wrong. I feel so useless and stupid. Sometimes I imagine how the world would be without me, others wouldn't be at peace but I would. But it is because of others that i stop myself. 
*sigh*
Thank you for reading this, I feel like I needed to get this out.",depression
WTF!,"So here we go again. Spirling right back down into depression. Lithium has given up just like all the rest of the treatments. Just found out yesterday that my secondary health insurance has been canceled since July 31st. They never sent me a letter and email a notification telling me to go on a website where it shows that it was. They never received my renewal packet so there's that. So having problems at home with the Mr. He doesn't understand shit what I'm going through which is extra stressful. I said just think maybe it's time for me to move on and just be by myself but just feeling miserable, isolating, binch eating, lost interest in the gym and being with friends and so forth. This fuckin roller coaster ride has got to stop at some point because I'm ready to jump the fuck off while it's in mid motion. This has been 20 years now. Going on half my life dealing with this bullshit. I'm not even living really, I'm just existing. Like I always say to people, once depression digs its claws into you it's almost like the claws are never released. Their dug deep into you. Some people are so good at masking it or using substances to mask or hide behind it. I've been down all those paths. I refuse to do any of that shit. I'm not putting on a fake smile for anyone, I'm not drinking myself into a drunken stupor, or I'm not taking a bunch of pills, I'm not doing any of crap anymore. That's all old now it's like when I'm like this, I'm just like this! I'll tell you I don't wanna be around anyone, I am not in the mood for company and not in the mood to do anything, I'm not coming to your birthday party, etc., I don't feel well and that's that! Well I hope everyone else is having a better day than me but this week and last week was kind of shit! So I hope everyone's feeling well and dealing with everything as well as can be expected. Hugs to all!!",depression

"First time post, long time depressed","Hi everyone!  I have avoided joining this group for a long time because I thought it would be depressing.  lol  Ironic, huh?  Sometimes, I can make light of my depression.  I've battled it my entire life.  The scary part is, I have seriously contemplated suicide three times: once at around 15, once at around 23 and once at around 62.  Yep, I'm an oldie but goody!  I have never gone to a shrink about it because I tend to to snap out of it every time on my own, eventually.  I really do not want to be on any kind of drugs for it either, that's for sure.  Also ironic is that I studied psychology in college because I found all things of the psyche to be fascinating. I still do. I tend to believe that my depression has everything to do with my thoughts, not some chemical imbalance. If I ever do go to a shrink it will be a cognitive therapist.  But, if I were completely truthful, there may be some heredity involved as well.  I noticed that my father was quite depressed for many years, but his life sucked in a lot of ways.  
Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and remind everyone that having something to look forward to helps, and exploring new things helps too.  Even if you don't feel like it at first... act as though you do, and you may be surprised.  Also, don't discount the little joyful moments in life, short as they may be.  I lost my husband, my mom, and my sister all within five years.  That nearly destroyed me.  But, I told myself to just keep breathing in and out, and that is why I am still here today (and not all days are bad).
As for my worst episodes, I feel trapped - like I need to run away and escape (again).  I feel completely isolated like nobody in the entire world could possibly know what I'm going through.  The worst thing I feel is un-needed.  I'm at an age now where my kids and grandkids are all grown up living their own lives and I really am not needed by anyone anymore.  If I didn't have to work full time, I would get a dog because I love dogs, but I just can't bring myself to keep a dog locked up in a house for 10 hours a day while I am gone.  It just wouldn't be fair to any animal to do that.  (I live in an area that is too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter to leave a dog outside.)  
Anyway, just wanted to let you know I stopped by.  I'm a newbie here, but certainly no newbie to depression.

Anxiety-Fuled Depression,"I'm not really sure if I should be posting this here or in the anxiety forum, but a lot of my depression seems to be fuled by anxiety. Earlier this year, I was doing really well. I'd finally figured out a career path I was excited about, my anxiety and depression were better, I'd found a good schooling program I got into, things overall were looking up. Then a suppressed memory of my sister abusing me came up, and it kind of feels like my whole world got turned upside-down. I've started journalling again, and I'm trying meditation. I've calmed down a little from when the memory first came up, but the depression and anxiety are definately worse. I can't currently afford councilling, especially with school.
The worst part is, I keep noticing little inconsideracies my sister does, and I keep wondering if she's still abusive. I've always thought of them as no more than regular inconsideracies that most people living together for a long time occasionally do, but now I'm not so sure. She does things like always burying or throwing out things (like utensils or spices) I use in the kitchen, always barging into my room without asking even when she knows I don't want her there, demanding that I let her hug me (or other casual touches) even when she knows I don't want her to, or making fun of my ideas or anxieties that I share with her. I don't know if it's at a pathological level, but now I wonder, and it makes me feel like an aweful sister.
And then I keep getting bombarded with all the bad news. First the burning of Notre Dam, then the two shootings, and now the burning of the Amazon. It feels like the world is literally ending, and it feels like I'm partially guilty because I can't do anything about it. While this thought is not nearly as strong as it was when the memory first surfaced, I find myself sometimes thinking, ""We're all going to die anyway. Why wait? Why not just get it over with?"" I ended up blocking a friend on social media because they were posting about all this stuff non-stop. And now it's on the Yahoo news feed. I just can't seem to escape it, even for a little while.
As I said, the journalling and meditating is helping some, but do you guys have any book reccomendations on processing trauma? Or any other suggestions?",depression
Help,"hi everyone. I had a terrible night last night and idk what to do from here. I’m going to church in the morning to find help there, but I need to do more. Is there anyone in the Cincinnati, Ohio area?? I need someone to talk to.",depression
its all too overwhelming,"I'm stuck in this loop of: not doing anything because I'm too anxious to do it and then when I do do something, I get too anxious and have a panic attack and don't do anything for the rest of the day. There's so much that needs to be done and my life is quickly falling apart because I'm constantly too anxious, depressed, and overwhelmed to do anything. Both my mind and my life are a complete mess and I don't know where to start. I've been trying to fix things over the past couple months, but no matter what, I always end up sitting on my couch crying all day. I know I have to start small and work on a few things at a time, but it's hard to focus on just a few things when it all needs to be done. Does anyone have something useful they do if they feel too overwhelmed by a task?",depression
Struggling with anger?,"Hello everyone. I have recently started to struggle with the idea that I may have depression. I don't think I fit the typical mold, the one portrayed in medication commercials. You know the ones: can't sleep, can't smile, can't get out of bed. Those aren't my issues. I've just been through a lot of trauma in my life, getting hit over and over again, and I don't think I have hope anymore. I just wish I wasn't here anymore, not suicidal, but also not exactly wanting to live. My question is - does anyone else deal with anger more than sadness? I seem to be angry with everything, angry with the world. I get so easily angitated and lash out when no one else is around. It's maddening.",depression
Update,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I am doing much better these days-- I saw a psych who was actually pretty good, she listened to me and was very empathetic (makes a nice change). She prescribed me Prozac, which I have to admit is helping. Work has calmed down a bit and I'm now working four 10-hour shifts, which I LOVE. Thanks everyone for being there for me on here when I was not doing as well.",depression
Bittersweet,"A big part of my depression has always been the absence of my father. He didn't really abandon me, but of course, my whole life I have felt that way, and my emotionally/verbally abusive mother has always tried to put things in my head. 
A few days ago (Augst 8th) I spent the day with him for the first time in 3 years. I found out a lot of things that nobody ever cared to tell me and had an amazing time. There's never been a time in my life where I've resented my father, and I still don't.
However, I've been struggling because he's sick. He tried to make it seem like it wasn't serious and that he isn't scared so I shouldn't be either, but I have an understanding of his diagnosis and it could be serious depending on the severity... He gave me all of his important items (photos, certificates, old baseball jersey, etc) and said it was because if anything were to happen, he wants somebody to have them.
He made sure that he told me if anything happens, he's proud of me and knows I'll be successful in life. Obviously, I knew that one day my father would pass, but I always prayed that I could get to a point where I could spend more time with him or see him whenever I wanted first. I don't think I'm ready to lose my father. Everything I do is for him and I could not imagine what I'd do without him.
Sorry that this was long, but the point is I'm really stressing and struggling and would appreciate all the prayer that you can offer.

Worried,"I have had issues with booze and mental health over last few years.
As a result I alienated a few colleagues in work..they just won't talk to me. About 6 out of 40.
In my family my sister is not talking to me because I sent a few dramatic texts about wanting to commit suicide. She had asked me to stop and sort myself out
 She has a troublesd special needs child so has enough on her plate.
My marriage has been in trouble too.
I did try rehab for the booze. It didn't work out. I'm finding my own way. Three weeks sober now. 
I do see a counselor. But at times I feel really really alone. At times I think of suicide. I have a young child.",depression
Setback,"Maybe i should write this on the anixety site instead of here but there is a relation. 
I attempted to go out on a date tonight. After ten years on the shelf because of my situation of having to take care of my mom by living with her. I finally now am living on my own and stable...or so i thought. I wanted to meet people but i dont go to bars anymore. I lost all of my friends because they were stll in the party scene and by taking care of my mother they didn't want to come over, so they slid away one by one. so i tried Tinder and met a good person, she was enjoyable to text with and i moved it to some very PG flirting to setting up a date tonight. 
When she arrived i was hit with a social anxiety from 10 years of rust (heck! 35 years of rust. i was never good at dating). At dinner it was very hard to feel relaxed, in fact impossible. But the real hit came from knowing her son has aspergers and the similarities to that of my own son and hit autism. What hurt was her, like me is a parent whose doing so much for her wonderful boy, it upset me that i could so lightly flirt and lead on so early. The thought of rejecting her when she seemed to really like me and hurting someone whose already fighting so hardmade me want to run away. Over texts it was safe and easy to hide within my own thoughts but seeing her made it real and the reality of dissapointing if we didn't click. we never had a chance because i was already out before 'hello'. She being very understanding and i aske if we could go back to texting and she said sure. but i feel im not ready in any way to date and wonder if i ever will be. Usually i'm more optomistic but this one pulled me down. ",depression

Coming back,"hello hello. Hi dailystrength community. It’s a lot but I am glad to be back.
i think I’ve hit a depressive episode lately and I’ve had an extremely difficult time not shaming myself and not being where I’d like to be. 
I lost my job a couple months ago. Financially things have hit a wall. I’ve disconnected from relationships that I’ve not been able to have a healthy relationship and communication with. Family is a source of toxicity and unhealthy connection. I’ve had to lower my expectations to find a job for survival purposes but it’s made me feel embarrassed and ashamed but it’s really what I think what others would want for me that is pressing me. I went through a rough patch last week with my sibling who has untreated bipolar depression and I had zero support from my mother at the time. 
I’m coming back to therapy because I really have no healthy outlet to cope and heal from all this insanity of life. I went back on my Zoloft so I still have ways to feel solid. I am making moves to make money and move out of my parents place but there is so much negative that has overwhelmed the positives that it has built a lot of fear of leaving my parents with my bro. My relationship with beliefs and God is something I’ve always stuck with but I strongly believe I’ve hit a point of make changes or just perish with my old coping habits n beliefs. 
I don’t want to hurt myself because it’s not the way but I also know that I’ve been brought back here and it’s great. My minds been so overwhelming and overloaded. Everything feels like a chore n my emotions just saturated with shame and unhealthy thinking.
I am used to much And I think too much and feel too much. This is a place to start to heal n work with self esteem and confidence.  ",depression
Slightly disappointed,Yesterday was my second day with my therapist. He's nice and easy to talk to but is young. Maybe I'm thinking too much of the position a therapist is supposed to fill (it has been a while since seeing one) he seemed empathically fearful to discuss more personal thoughts of spiritual struggle or identifying potential childhood trauma. He wasn't poor at his job but seemed to want to constantly Shepherd the conversation back to financial. So this big dumb ox subsided and let him lead. Think I'm just expecting Rome to be built in a day. (Sigh),depression

Is it depression?,"Hello everyone. I haven't been wanting to put anything here because I'm afraid that what I'm dealing with is just me overdramatizing my life, but I don't know because its been over three years of just feeling a constant weight that just feels like its draining me. Ever since I was a sophomore in high school I have been struggling with health issues in the form of a knee injury. I've had multiple knee surgeries after that and just got done with my fourth one. Ever since then, I haven't been able to play the sport I played since I was a little girl. Ever since my first surgery that happened around 3 years ago I just haven't felt myself. Don't want to work out, and I loved working out before but now it jsut reminds me of everyting I can't do so I just don't do it. And this sort of glum makes me just want to sit in my room staring at my wall with the blinds closed and a constant urge to cry all of the time. I just don't have the energy to move, get up, talk with people. Even when everything in my life is perfect or would seem perfect from the outside because I'm usually laughing when I am out in public, I just feel like going somewhere and curling up in a ball and cryihng where no one can see me because I don't want to ruin another person's happiness with my saddness. I'm not sure if what it is is an overwhelming sadness or depression I just know that its sometimes too much to handle and I feel hopelessness from time to time because I don't know what it is. ",depression
I'm just so tired.,"I started taking medication again. its been about 3 weeks now. I notice it has been helping. I don't have real suicidal thoughts. I don't have any plans to do harm to myself. I don't have many urges to self harm. overall I feel ok. I feel clam. not sad or happy, just clam. but one thing is I find myself feeling very overwhelmed a lot more. any little thing can get me worked up, for example if I planed something and it doesn't go my way. I feel very fragile and tired. sometimes everything just seems like too much and i feel very overwhelmed. I just want to press a pause button and make everything freeze and I can sit outside on the grass and close my eyes, and the world is not moving just quite.
maybe what I'm feeling is a side affect or I'm just becoming more myself again. and I was always a shy, quiet person who gets overwhelmed a lot. months I've been severally depressed, just a zombie and now I'm getting emotions back, I'm becoming more myself.  I feel things again and its overwhelming. a bit hard to fully explain what I mean.


I'm just so tired.",depression
feels like it's gonna be bad again today,"My wife, I believe has a scchizophrenic or DID or whatever disorder. I found out something which not only bothers me but terrifies me too. She didn't do something we both vowed we would never let happen again. She didn't pay the storage for two months and it was auctioned off. It is not like her, that is my wife, to do something like that. I believe, because of what I went through with her, that she is actually the alter and the one I had to live with and deal with is the original.  She is the one who didn't keep the vow. I wrote a really long entry in the multiple personality thing late last night.
Since I haven't heard anything from her or about her in three months, that is worry enough. Now this very uncharacteristic thing took place and it terrifies me.
I have no idea if she is still living where we did. If so, then I think her life is in danger.  If not, she is either more homeless than before or living with her addict daughter, who is probably keeping both of them in meth.  It is the meth which started all of this.  For all I know she is still the ""original"" one, the mean, cruel and angry one, the ""not-my-wife"" one.  Hard to explain, if you want, find the long entry I wrote.
Now I don't know what to do. We might not be together anymore, she might be living life as the angry, hateful one who is the original and still in her disorder, and hating me...but I still love her (my wife, the alter). 
I don't know why she broke the vow to never lose our stuff again, besides, if she finally gets on her own, she will need what is in the storage.  I do care if she is with somebody else, but yet I don't. Because of the disorder, my wife isn't really there, I don't think. The original one took over in late March and it just got worse as it went along.
As I said, if she is still living where we did, I fear for her life. We rented a small RV from an old friend, who is the mother to the idiot who abused her for a long time.  Neither one of them understand what is going on, that the woman they knew is not the one I call the original. They are either stupid, don't know about disorders or can't see the differences between the pair.  The original can act very much like my wife and can easily fool people, even the police.
Now since I haven't heard from her or anything about her, with the sale of our stuff, which means there is NOTHING left, it worries me very much. First I don't and never have trusted that dickhead she was with. The stories she told me enforce this belief that he could have done something to her.  In my heart, the horrible notion he let his terrible anger flair up and kill her accidently is there and is strong. This was the first thought I had when I read the email from the manager at storage.
If she is ok, I will never know it because she has pushed me so far out of her life, I don't exist any more. I don't know WHO she is now, the original, who did all of this mean things or if she is back being the alter, who is my wife...but probably has been rewired by the disorder...but even then, if so, I don't think she would have let it go.
I wrote her step-sister who knew nothing about the disorder. I don't think she believes me either. I asked her way back to get into contact with her, but she didn't and besides the original would fake her out anyway.
I need to know if she is ok. She will fake out everybody, she is very conviencing with what her disorder, to appear ""normal"" and has this ability to make others, even cops, believe her.  The landlady, her friend, is a bitch.  She hates me now because of what the original has insisted is real.  She is totally stupid, doesn't grasp or understand the one they knew isn't the one who is the original.
Skipping all that, you'd have to read the other entry.
So I am right back to the horrid depression, now my anxiety is up to 100% over this development. If I had never gotten that damn email from the manager, I would have never known this and worried like this.
Do I call the local cops, request a welfare check? Do I go with my gut reaction about the possibilities?  If they go there and she is still there, she will fake them out with her sincerity and she will tell them what she believes is real, which is all part of her disorder. They will not be able to tell the differences, even if I tell them about her, her psychological issue or about her alter, who is my wife who I was with for eleven years.  If the cops go there, all they will see is what the original wants them to see...an angry yet ""sad"" woman who claims her husband abandoned her (just like the ""other"" guy).  They will just see what she wants them to see.
I don't know what to do.  Do I just let it go and hope for the best? Do I go with the idea of calling cops for a welfare check, even though it is highly possible she will fake them out? The landlady hasn't accepted anything, so in her mind, the angry original one IS my wife and since she believes what she says is real...she will either lie or bullshit them.
All I want is to know she is ok, that she is in a safe place and not actually homeless.  She gets Social Security disability, it isn't as if she didn't have the money to pay the storage...she just didn't want to, perhaps to distance herself from the life my wife, her alter, had with me.  The more she gets rid of the past eleven years, the further away she gets from any threats to her ""reality"".
Do I trust the cops enough to at least understand she has psychological issues and will just tell them what her disorder believes, I can't call them lies when she actually believes them, can I?  To her it is real, to her what she believes is real, so are they lies? To her they aren't, to me they are, even though I didn't spend the eleven years with her, but with my wife, the alter.
Should I call the cops for a welfare check? Do I tell them what I know about her, as in this disorder? Do I trust they will understand it will not be my wife but the original?  Will they believe the lies from the landlady or her son?
I don't know what to do.  I could just let all of this go. She has, I guess, she has gotten on with her life, but it isn't her life, not really, it is the psychosis, she lives in both realities. My wife, the alter, is in there somewhere, in her brain, but it does no good. The original will not ""let her out,"" to do so means a risk to her reality, just like having me there...just like the storage.
What should I do?
If I let it go, with the storage and the worry she is now on her own, unprotected and in her disorder...I just worry for her safety. If I just let it go, I will never know but maybe that is a good thing?  I feel as if, no matter what I do in the rest of my life or if I am lucky to even be with another woman---I am so heavily invested in what happens to her, because, well, my wife is her alter and I love her, she loves me, this I know for truth.  As the original, she will continue onward, oblivious to the real reality, most likely still doing meth which makes it all worse.
What? What should I do?",depression
HELP,"Hi Everyone ! 
I'm new to this group so I figured I would share a little about me in hopes that it starts a connection 
June 21st 2019 my whole world flipped upside down.  I lost my fiance to an drug overdose . I had an beautiful future planned with him just for it to be taken away so quickly . No warning signs. No goodbyes.
I'm 8 months pregnant expecting our little girl to enter the world on September 23rd. You can say my emotions have been off the charts.  I've been very depressed which is understandable right ? I lost so much more than my fiance.  He was my best friend, my better half , my soulmate.  We spent every single day together.
I've had to find a new reason to live . I tell everyone that my daughter keeps me going even though she isn't here yet.  I feel guilty that sometimes I wish God would take me too so that I could be with my fiance again . I know that this little girl needs me more than ever and I am so blessed to be having her but, the pain of losing my fiance is so intense.
I know God has a reason for everything he does but, it just seems unfair that he took my fiance away from me .  I wish life had a rewind button. ",depression
Broken Hearted,"I didn't go into work today... I'm sorry. I drove all the way over to the Starbucks near there and just started crying. Couldn't stop. So I called in sick and drove back to the nearest crisis services center near where I live. Got an appointment set up with a psychiatrist for later in the month and in the meantime, they are going to look over my meds at the Behavioral Health center to see what can be done to tweak them in the interim. I really think it is my meds... something's off. I've tried every single coping skill I can think of-- drawing, brisk walk, journaling, baths, calling friends/family, state crisis services, my therapist. I called the state crisis hotline and it was like talking to a brick wall. There would be moments of complete silence between my statements and his response. Finally he asked, ""Is this helpful?"" ""Not really,"" I said. ""I need more feedback and constructive insight than this."" ""Well I'm not comfortable dealing with people with strong emotions."" ""Then why are you a crisis counselor?"" Was my response. I finally got ahold of my therapist, who said to go to urgent care or a crisis center. Just got out. I feel like a fraud and a failure for calling in sick to work. But I didn't think I'd be any good there today. My brain was fuzzy and I couldn't stop crying. Something's gotta give here. I can't live like this much longer.",depression
exhausted,"its been around 4-5 weeks that I've been on my new medication. It is helping. I don't feel suicidal or depressed.
I don't know how I feel really. I just know I feel better. not happy but alive. but I have notice that I feel exhausted all the time. I have an eating disorder but I don't feel exhausted because of that. I'm in recovery and I'm eating so its not that type of exhausted. maybe its the medication. but I'm not sure about that before I started taking the medication I remember being tired a lot and not hanging with friends. I just feel mentally and physically tired. tired of myself, tired of people, the world, just tired of everything. I feel like right now I'm a walking time bomb. Any moment I can explode from any little thing. I get overwhelmed so easy right now easier then usually and I get so angry and annoyed quickly. I have to hum or deep breathing or sometime of yoga to keep me sane but I feel any minute I can explode. I don't understand why I've been feeling so overwhelmed, there is nothing for me to really worry about. I'm just so exhausted. is feeling exhausted another way of feeling suicidal because even though I don't think of wanting to die in a way its the say thing of just feeling so exhausted with life.",depression

I feel guilty for wanting more,"I wish I was smarter.
I wish I was stronger.
I wish I was more disciplined
I wish I never tried drugs
I wish I had different friends
I wish I had a different family

I'm a 24 year old dude and I have a hard time accepting that I have to leave my ""friends"" behind.Those ""friends"" that make me feel weird for staying home and working on my future instead of blowing my money on drugs.My mom,my dad,my brother,all my friends.They all have zero ambition to do anything more with themselves or explore life.Whenever I want to do something new or play a show I always have to go by myself because everyone in my social circle would rather stay home and play beer pong for the thousandth time.I've always felt an intense pull towards creative pursuits(music, movies,drawing,etc) and I work really hard everyday to get better at those skills.Life feels so rich and purposeful when I read a good book.But then I realize no one around me has any clue what I'm talking about if I make a reference to it and when I explain the reference I feel like a fucking know it all freak trying to feel smart or something.I moved in with one of my ""buddies"" that I thought had my back and was trying to create a better future for himself,but now he just tries to sell me drugs and deal with his life through avoiding problems.I myself have a pretty bad drug addiction(I've done everything except heroin) and that is part of the reason I'm so behind.I told him this thinking it would catch some sympathy and he'd stop asking,but nope.Then he let this deadbeat dude move in.Can't hold a job, pretty sure he's got some sorta bipolar shit goin on and in general he's bitter about his life.This is a problem for me because he sabotages my music career and tries to make me feel like a weirdo for working on myself every chance he gets.I've explained this to my ""buddy"", but he legit doesn't care how I feel about this because he's the exact same way now.I have a lot of people in my social circle that are pretty decent musicians and they say they want a music career, but they don't think practically and won't practice by themselves.This is the hardest part for me.I know I need to start reaching out to other musicians,but where I live pretty much every musician outside of my circle so far has been in their late 30's and only wants to play covers and live in the past.I keep having dreams where my teeth rot out and I know that means something in my psyche is changing, but I don't know what.Maybe I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I fucked up the first 24 years of my life hanging around losers that just wanna talk about getting stuff done.It seems like the only way to get where I want to be in life is by embracing solitude and alienating myself for a year or two.I rememebr when I was a kid I had these intense waves of fear because I just felt so alone and small.I'd think about how we're just a bunch of talking monkeys on a rock floating around a fireball suspended by nothing and fucking cry at the meaninglessness of all this.Then i'd start beating myself up for taking this all so seriously and not believing in magic or whatever the fuck gravity is.That's why I feel bad leaving these people.Those feelings were gone for so long thanks to them.As I write this I'm realizing my relationships so far have had the same purpose as the drugs.And now I feel like these relationships are a complete waste of my time and I feel guilty for calling a person a waste of time.It's like my brain won't let me just believe something like I always end up talking myself into nihilism to the point where I anticipate it. Like as soon as I get excited I think about how it's probably just dopamine or serotonin being released in my brain because I ate some chocolate or something.I just want to be a kid and believe in santa and god again.I don't hate life. I just don't believe in it .
Time to make some changes.

Thanks for listening and I hope you have a meaningful day :)",depression

Depression treatment,"Hi Friends,I am a 28-year-old girl living in Toronto. I was very happy when I was single. Last week, I and my boyfriend ended our 5-year relationship. He dumped me. My boyfriend was so caring before. A But things get worsened after 4 years. I found that he was in a relationship with another girl and he was just using me for money. He started behaving rudely. I understood that he is deliberately ignoring me. So with a heavy heart, I decided to forget him. I am struggling with depression and I am very sad. Seeing my condition, one of my friends suggested me to approach a biofeedback therapy service in Toronto. I am hearing about this for the first time and I don't know about it. If anybody had previous experience with this, please share your opinions and suggestions here.Thanks!",depression
Just needed a check in...,"It's been a long hard past couple months so guess I just needed a place to vent for a moment as I've always recieved positive feedback off here before.  My son has severe mental health issues and he has been struggling with them since he was younger and he is only 12 as sad as that sounds, but he has been diagnosed with an array of things more prominently unspecified szicophenia and he takes some pretty heavy medications which I hate but know is necessary.  He has been placed in facilities a few times a couple of which I didnt really have a choice or say in the matter because if his violent tendencies and safety concerns for his siblings but we have worked so hard with his therapists and psychiatrists and developmental disabilities worker to try and keep him from having to go back but with the decline of the mental health system especially for youth the resources are limited and now once again he is back in the hospital.  I know its what's best and this is for his own good to keep him as well as his brothers safe but it still kills me, hes my baby and the only place they have is almost 5 hours away and to top it off our car broke down so I'm struggling to figure out how I will get up to see him every week... it seems everything that can go wrong will and if I didnt already have enough stress on my plate now cps is lurking around which I try not to worry about as having a son like I do I'm used to it they always come snooping around when he gets hospitalized and nothing comes of it because he has a record a mile long and I do everything I'm supposed to with the resources that are available but I also stress because there are some who dont care and want to cause problems just because they can and I know the child welfare system is corrupt and honestly they dont have to have a reason so take kids they have been knows to do it before and yes they get grants and job security for every family they put in the system and I've faught long and hard to stay out of it even to the point of having to sell everything and borrow to hire attorneys to do so because of who my son is.and after all this time given my sons history you'd think they would finally leave me alone but no this happens every time! lol...I'm sure it will work out but I'm so stressed right now I could just use some comforting wordst/advice I guess lol",depression

Positivity,"To everyone here that has a hard time, I want to say that you have the power to change direction. I call it a dark cloud over head. The thing is it doesn’t have to be permanent. Find the source of that cloud and do something about it. Anything is better than nothing. I thought I wasn’t doing anything to help myself and it was pointed out that just being here was something. It doesn’t have to be a huge shift you make. It only has to be a step. You take that step and you see it’s ok. You take that step and before you know it you look up and your already down the street. You’ll be like hey how did I get here. That’s how easy it could be. Now I don’t always think like this, but today I am so hopeful this message motivates someone to do something. Write a journal, clean you room, heck bake some cookies. It sounds dumb but I made some chocolate chip cookies from scratch the other day and before I knew it I was smiling. ",depression
Can't let myself be happy,"Each time I feel even the slightest bit of happiness I think of all the negative things in my life to remind me why I can't be truly happy. I've tried not to, but it feels impossible. ""How can I be happy when I have credit card debt and student loans looming over me?"" These financial burdens are a HUGE part of my stress and depression, as it feels like I'll never get rid of them. I had someone close to me offer to pay for some of my debt, but then when I tried to pursue the option they said it may not be the best idea after all. It's totally understandable, but I've been fairly depressed ever since because I was given hope and it felt like it was snatched away. Now I feel like I'm back at rock bottom with no hope of climbing up.

Aside from that, I got moved to a new department at work that I've wanted to be moved to since day one. I love my job and I love my coworkers. But my pay does not match the fact that I have 2 degrees, and although it pays my bills it doesn't allow me to contribute anything extra to my mountain of debt. I should be happy that I got a job I've had my eye on for months, but I can't let myself be because it's not enough financially. To add onto that, a few of my family members and my significant other are making double (or triple) what I make yearly, and they never even went to college. I just feel like all my hard work was a waste and I'm a humungous failure. How can I be happy when I'm not as successful as them?

I feel like I jumped around a lot in this post, but I've been dealing with so many different emotions. Thanks to anyone taking the time to read.",depression
Me Time,"You spend so many years doing things for other people that when the time comes to be free from that, can you actually do for yourself. Do we know how to do anything for ourselves. If we did then why are we all here. Yet we are here so that’s doing something. I guess it’s normal to feel that way. If your walking down the wrong road you just go the other way. But you have to go all the way back to take the other fork in the road. By that time do you have anything left in the tank. What happens if you don’t make it. I suppose that since we walked that road once already, the worst that could happen is ending back up where you originally started. Maybe that’s not so bad since I’m here now and I’m still standing.

I feel like a prisoner,"these past few months have been hell. I moved in with my boyfriend and have been looking for jobs since I graduated college. I knew I wouldnt find anything in my field right away so I'm looking for part time work to keep up with the bills. However, the problems started when his family decided to buy me a car. I never asked for it and his mother got a stick shift which I have no idea how to drive. At first I just cringed and said, "" its fine its just another learning experience."" I thanked them for the car but I havent driven it on my own once since they bought it. I have repeatedly told my boyfriend I need repitition in order to learn. I have asked him to take me out to the country side in the evening after hes off work but so far in the past 3 months I have gone driving a weeks worth.
I have suggested just walking to some places nearby I could work from but my boyfriend is afraid I'll get run over since we live near a major city and it can get hectic. My biggest issue is I have horrible anxiety from driving, I have to have a stuffed animal in my purse whenever I drive and because of this my boyfriend treats me like I'm made of glass.  I feel trapped in our house and since my boyfriend has aspergers and adhd he doesnt notice the obvious signs that I'm on edge, not happy and I have to constantly repeat why I'm upset.
It all came to a head when we finally had a chance to go driving but I hadnt slept well so I was zoning in and out. when we finally got out to the open roads I started crying saying "" Im sorry but I cant today afterall. I dont think I can stay awake.""
I felt so angry at myself and he saw this which prompted him to ask me for the 10th time that day, "" are you ok? whats wrong?""
I snapped. I started crying harder and trying to explain to him that it got under my skin how he felt the need to ask the same question over and over and over. It made me feel like he wasnt listening. He then raised his voice and said,"" fine. Great. So its my fault, I'm just trying to help but I cant do anything right its just my fault.""
He has done this everytime he's seen me upset. Its like he gets tunnel vision and refuses to listen to anyone but his own voice. It escelated from there to the point I was screaming at the top of my lungs, "" I NEED A JOB! I NEVER WANTED THIS CAR BUT IM STUCK WITH IT AND IM FALLING BEHIND ON MY BILLS! NOW FUCKING TELL ME HOW IN THE FUCKTHATS YOUR FAULT????? WHY ARE YOU GUILTNG ME?"" he slammed on the breaks and got out of the car yelling back, "" drive yourself home!""
I got out and kept arguing with him to get back in the car. After a while we went home but the whole way back I was bawling and thinking, "" you know.....I just missed a great opportunity. I could have just walked away from him, the car, everything and kept walking till my legs gave and I cold die quietly out in the middle of nowhere.""
My depression has taken a turn for the worse since I got here, I'm trying so hard to stay sane and get my life going but I'm trapped.",depression
Cruel irony,"The day started in good spirits as I finished my first draft on the book I've been writing with enough not to post a journal about it.
But as the day progressed, a Domino of events have ruined my day. Firstly for those who read my joyful journal I feel I need to explain that I had just reached the goal of actually just completing the story in rough draft. Now I need to edit and revise. There is nothing outside personal accomplishment achieved. It is a goal met and I feel good about that at least.
I am reluctant to speak of faith here as each has a varied opinion and I'm not waiting to get into and God vs Not diatribes. But I'm disappointed in some people's views that 'the blood of goats and rams' in sacrifice has been replaced with the 'blood of the wallet' when according to the Bible, the sacrifice that Jesus gave removed the barrier between man and God and the need for sacrifice. My understanding is tithes is to help maintain the church and it's needs and gladly gave for that upkeep. But some pressure (in my feeling) that it is 'sinful' if you don't give till it hurts. Well, times are hard for us all, and this vent isn't really wanting religious opinions or bashing. It's just more a sad realization of how rough the world is on us all and there things we'll think to get use through. This triggered other issues, like my beautiful son who has high functioning autism and is the kindest, gentle soul. But it brings dread of worrying about him in this world. There's not really anything that can be said about that, dad's just going to have to do his best for him as long as he can.
 Lack of friends or a loved one can wear in times like this also. Tried social sites but most I communicated with were scams, narcacists, or liars. Don't do the bar scene, was a bouncer for 6 years and know that joke ALL too well. Work freinds are just that, as most show thier caveman mentality of derogatory humor at female anatomy.

Intro,"Hi
Thought I would give a quick intro. Was formally diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my early 50s. Many people over the years suggested I need help and medication. Tried everything but meds, reached out for help many times, but never made inroads. Started on meds after a major family crisis 6 years ago which is still continuing. First med didn't really help, 2nd one made a huge difference but effect started wearing off after a couple of years. Started seeing a psychiatrist last year and was diagnosed with cPTSD from a combination of childhood trauma and what is happening in our family. 
Meds have been a life changer for me. Wish I'd gone on them sooner. Am now on a combination to help with different symptoms.
Starting to feel myself slipping again, but loathe to change meds. Just have a constant low mood, sleep heaps, struggle to get going.
Hoping to get and give support.",depression

I feel completely broken (possible trigger),"I was feeling alright earlier this summer and around May/June. I'd felt OK about my decision to quit my job as I felt the atmosphere was really stressful, chaotic and intense.  But things have taken a turn I think for the worse.  I was taking classes over the summer and then I was scheduled for a routine colonoscopy/cancer screen.  Not something I look forward to, but I had one five years ago and it was ok. It was time to do it again. Well, it just didn't go that well.  He couldn't see very much, and ended up removing a benign growth, but because he could not see that much and the prep didn't go well, he wants to do it again in two months. I didn't recover well and wound up back in the ER because I had intense abdominal cramping, was unable to really eat, and lost weight rapidly. After going to the ER, they gave me something for the cramping and an IV and I started to come back around. But I couldn't go out and meet people or do anything, and so it kept me here. 
Meantime, I was trying to interview for jobs, I really need to find a fulltime job, and I didn't get the two jobs that I interviewed for. I got my last paycheck last week and now I am really freaking out. I only got some temp work, which really doesn't feel very secure. On top of  this, I guess menopause has decided to start and I went to the doc and figured out this is the real reason that I only sleep 3 or 4 hours a day, the immense hot flashes were a huge indicator and blood tests confirmed this. So they did the blood work, and now I don't have insurance either, and they are starting me on hormone replacement therapy  so that I can feel more like myself.
On top of this, both of my friend groups have disintegrated. I sort of wonder if all of this was caused by me starting spiritual work or beginning the practice of meditation, which I took up to try to get centered and stablize my life. Someone had said that doing meditation, etc. or spiritual work can sometimes cause your life to shift and become really unstable. Did I cause all this?  I don't know...I don't really think so...my real feeling on it is that these situations were probably inherently unstable to begin with and maybe a lot of  this was impending and likely to happen.  It just seems that all my efforts to regroup after failure or setback in the past never have worked. For example, my career as a teacher has been a total disaster. Even the last job that I had, I was not fired or disciplined or anything like that, but I did my best to make it a happier and better experience after the past couple of bad teaching jobs...only to find it was full of conflict and drama.  Eventually I started to wonder if it was simply just the career itself. And friend groups, when I saw that one was not doing well or was unhealthy, I would try another, only to find that that one was infected as well.  I honestly feel like I've tried everything in my life and  that everything is just rotten poision. And now I'm having heath issues, including migraines. I didn't have those before. All my efforts to rebuild and recoup seem to have come to nothing. I've made it to  midlife and feel I have pretty much *next* to nothing to show. I have/had a 15 year difficult/tumultous career and several failed relationships. I really tried, and now I'm too old to have kids. Why does it have to be like this? The guy I thought it really was going to work with has gone on to several other women, in succession and has totally cut me off, taking down our pics, were not even friends anymore. I dont' get it, I try to be positive, do my  best, I don't know. Some of my friends seem to be going through similar things, really hitting hard times, and I  don't feel like I can be there for them. Death in family, catastrophic illness, accidents, wow. I haven't been a good friend, I've not returned messages and such, I'm so overwhelmed and preoccupied it's ridiculous. ",depression
not good at being there for my friend (trigger),"I have a good friend whose brother committed  suicide.  I have not been checking in with her and if I am being honest I would say I've been evading her because years back I had attempted suicide and so the whole topic makes me extremely uncomfortable. She is  not aware of this. I'm sure she is going through a hell of a lot.  She messaged me that she wanted to get together and go to a comedy club. I did not answer, I'm not usually one to do that, but just with my own life being really in flux and so much going on, health issues, need to find a job, I just feel a sense of panic.  Plus comedy just did not seem appropriate at the moment. It's just  something that I find really hard to deal with. It's not her fault she  doesn't deserve this. She also had a really bad car accident right after and I guess she's pretty hurt. I just got out of hospital myself so I don't feel I'm much help.  I feel guilty but the fact is even before this happened sometimes she could be intense and kind of difficult to hang with and so I put in a little distance.

I didn't tell this to my dr. party because I forgot about it and partly because I don't want to alarm them, but as my depression worsens, I find it harder and harder to go out or do the simplest things.  Even with an increase of seroquel, I can't sleep because menopause hit and now the hot flashes are ruining everything at night, making everyting worse.  It's a vicious circle of withdraw from people, refuse to go out or answer the phone, cry, etc.  But while I sit here in the house, when I'm sleepless my mind goes thru weird thoughts. It could be because of all the media I am taking in and the isolation. I watch fascinating but morbid stuff like  Black Mirror and a lot of New Age you tube. There are a lot of weird beliefs propogated on these channels, such as ""we are all part of a computer program, nothing you see is real, this is just a matrix,"" and Black Mirror proposes some of the same things. So when I'm alone at night, feeling lost and sad, I start to think things like, ""maybe I have died and I am dead and I don't know it,"" or, ""maybe the guy I was seeing programmed me and I was just a computer code, and now I'm back in the computer."" I know this is all BS and baloney and is probably a result of the endless stream of videos and shows that I am watching becuase I'm bored and out of work and sad and need something to watch.  Obviously I am still here, and no I don't think we live in a matrix and I think it's all a lot of new age hogwash, and no I am not a computer code.  But I have been on a spiritual website for like a year or so in a community, where people DO tend to believe this stuff, and I kinda feel like because of it I'm going off the deep end as it were.  I'm just so dissatisfied and upset about the state of my current life that I just need something, but I don't need a bunch of bullshit. I think I'm going off the deep end, frankly, and losing my grip on reality, and I don't think that a lot of these spiritual people have a great grip on reality either.",depression
trying to make sense of this,"About three years ago, I had gotten a new job and made a new set of friends.  I was feeling optimistic about the whole thing.  I had met a guy  that I really liked and we seemed to hit it off really well.  I felt that we really bonded and connected, and I was just thrilled about the whole thing. He wanted my number, I didn't give it to him right away, as his friend was interested in me as well, and it was a little confusing. But he said to let him know if I ever was interested. So about six months later, when I saw him, I did. Things did not go well from there, for about nine months or so he basically continued to lead me on, acting like he liked me, spending time hanging out with me, promising to make plans (and not keeping them) buying me drinks...blah blah...we had the same friends.  But one of his friends just bluntly told me in front of both of us that he  was a big liar. It was like this explosive bomb was dropped on me, I was bewildered. I didn't want to believe it was true, I felt really close and bonded with him, and was attracted to him. Toward the end of the year and holiday season, about a year and a half ago, after he was expressing a lot of interest and trying to get to know me, suddenly I was removed from invite lists from the friend group parties.  I was totally stunned and could not make sense of it, I saw him later at and event and he was acting very strangely, almost hostile toward me, like jekyll and hyde.  I tried to forget about it. Later on, he met someone new, it was all over social media, their relationship did not last and then the strangest thing happened.  He destroyed his entire facebook, took down all the pics of his profile from the last ten years, everything he had written about his life, took down our friend pics, quit hanging out with the rest of our friend group, completely erased literally like ten years off his facebook, and he'd had like 20 profile pics. They are all gone.  I started to get incredibly suspicious. There is one now only one with him with shades. He now has this new woman who is just the  best thing ever, in a weird way she resembles me a little, and he is taking her to the places he said he would take me to.  All I can feel is rage and disgust, like this is someone I never knew, not to mention that I dated someone else in the group later and they lied to me about being married. I just blocked him because I can't look at it, I can't stand to see this woman who sorta looks like me going to places he said he would take me, and he was able to see me on mutual tags and he was liking the pics. I feel really weird and fearful now that he chopped his entire facebook up and I feel like there might be something seriously wrong with him.  I know I should be over it, but I feel like with the whole friend group gone, too, that I spent two years of my life in that has vanished, that I went into some sort of time warp, and I just can't see how you can have relationships and have them suddenly cut like this, or see someone you thought you knew, and you don't.  I'm so bewildered.",depression
when is happy too happy? (trigger),"How do you know when you are too happy?  I feel very sad now, but earlier this summer, I was feeling strangely euphoric, I just considered it a welcome break from my depression. But, I have to say I was a huge burst of creative ideas and there were times I would for no reason feel intense ecstasy.  I don't have a dx of bipolar, but there are times I would consider myself clairvoyant, etc, like I can feel energy and think in symbols. I don't know if any of this is normal or if I should tell my doctor.  There is nothing wrong with being happy, but I just remember earlier this summer laying on my bed and feeling an immense rush and it was really strange.  I was following other new age beliefs saying  that we are from the stars that we are from other planets. This cannot really be true, though. This defies logic.  I am not from stars, I am just a human being. I don't know. I hope this seroquel is working. I had quit my job and changed careers, not that it's a bad thing, it's about time coming, and took out a lot of savings, but part of me wonders if I made rash decisions because I was so unhappy in my life and I just didn't think things through because I was in such intense psychic pain from the stress of my awful job that I made rash changes.  But now I have regrets.  At first I was thrilled to let myself out of the awful stress to change careers and now I'm having trouble adjusting to the changes I've made. I don't know if I should tell my parents or not. I can't tell if I've made a mess of my life or if I'm really working toward better. It's a very rough period of adjustment.  One of my friends I really can't talk to right now, her brother unfortunately took his life, so I don't want to burden her.  I feel overwhelmed. My therapist doesn't feel like she can help me, probably because my insurance ran out, mainly.  It was really stabilizing to see her, and now she's saying I should see someone who can help with trauma. WTH.  I'm afraid to lose my income, my car and my place. Holy crap.  I need to sleep thru the night but I've started hormone therapy for the massive disruption to my sleep. Good god. ",depression

Mantra,"    I realized recently that since I began to heal and prioritize my happiness I’ve held this ideology: “it’s not worth living unless I am happy.” I’ve also begun to realize that this might not be a good thing to believe. 
     It puts a pressure on my healing, something like.. “if I don’t make progress, I might end up dying.” It makes me worried; if I ever hit rock, rock bottom and decide it’s not worth it anymore. 
     I’ve never been one to seriously plan suicide. I couldn’t imagine actually taking my life because of hitting a deep low. I made a promise to myself a long time ago I’d never do that to myself. Still, this insidious thought has crept in and remains and disturbs me. 
      Do you guys have any suggestions for a better mantra? ",depression

I am Hopeless,"It seems that no one cares about me anymore. i think they are just too tired of me. Everyone has just gave up on me. I went to my counseling appointment today and it went terrible. I basically said that I wanted to kill myself, but it seemed she didn't care. I thought she was the person i could go to and talk to but now I'm just all alone again. everyone just doesn't give a shit about me. this other lady i talked to, when i told her i had thoughts about killing myself she said something like, do whatever you want and if i really wanted to kill myself i would be dead already.
i feel like no one cares about me anymore. because I'm 19 years old almost 20 in October. I'm not a child anymore and no one has time for me anymore.
i wish the counseling person had a different response to me. but it just seemed like she didn't care. i wish she did something, anything. i wouldn't be that mad if she told my mom. i just wish someone hears me. i was hoping she could referral me to a place. not really a Hospital but a place to take a break from the world and only focus on mental health. like a recovery place. maybe that could help me stay safe and help with my depression and anxiety and my eating disorder. i would be able to fight all theses problems all at once. maybe a place like that would be good i wouldn't feel so overwhelmed with the real world.
the only thing that stops me from asking to go to a place like that is what about school? it would be perfect to be in a place like that and still be able to go to school. and i don't have the money to go to a nice place like.
right now i feel so hopeless and everyday is becoming more and more harder. I'm not going back to that counseling she made me feel so horrible today. i don't know what to do anymore and i feel so alone and unloved. ",depression
Anyone experienced benefit from medication?,"I am going through a rough patch right now and have been the past several months. My depression feels as if it has gotten severe; I lack energy, experience daily headaches, difficulty concentrating, guilt, hopelessness, and most disturbingly to me, have had daily suicidal ideation (at times to the point of devising plans). 
Despite having bad reactions to a few in the past, I was thinking of trying an antidepressant, mainly becuase I am feeling so hopeless right now. I have several hesitations (including wondering if they work well) but mainly, I am terrified of uncontrollable weight gain. I have anorexia nervosa (which has lately also flared up) so the weight gain is something that terrifies me.
I guess I am looking to hear others' experiences with medications for depression (or anxiety - I have that too).

Feeling emptiness/numbness,"this is probably one of the worst feelings I have, feeling empty, this feeling constantly takes over me and it feels unavoidable, it feels as if I can feel no emotion like I’m limp and numb. This feeling hits me at the most random times, when I wake up, when I’m at church, when I’m laying down, or even when I’m just finally feeling ok for the first time. It always feels like a reminder that I’m not ok and I suffer it’s like one second I feel alright and then boom I feel empty and cold once more. And it sucks because I may be out and it just hits me and I start acting anti-scocial and then people start asking what’s wrong and then I start feeling irritated because they keep on asking and it’s overwhelming cuz now I have to face them and say “nothings wrong I’m fine” and they give me a look and I hate that look. But then they go about their business and I go back to mine which is me just being in a corner, not talking to anyone hoping no one comes over to try and talk to me cuz knowing myself I wouldn’t be in the best mood.

[eye roll],"This is mostly just to rant. But i needed a small 'vent'
Checking my accounts I saw a withdrawl from a vendor i had cancelled a month ago.

Only to see this charge, My CU said they couldn't stop payment and that the only way to keep them out of my account is to cancel that card and be issued a new one. meaning i'll have to deal with all the other things attached to that card. the short of it is I have to do battle again with these crooks and spend the next 4 hours updating to my new card with little precived help from the CU.

First Post: Feeling hurt deeply.,"I have been struggling with depression and feelings of not wanting to be here anymore. I know that isn't an option as I am the mother of two boys and was the sole income for the last 10 years almost (my husband is starting a job on the 12th of August). Well, I am already struggling to only find out my nieces and nephew's step father is spreading lies about my family that includes his brother in law and mother in law. He is saying this stuff to people who don't know us. We are a good family. I love my mother in law and I know, she does love me. We get along well for the most of the time. I try hard to be kind to others and help others when I can. I am not trying to make myself look good. I know I have my faults- we all do but I do my best to be kind and make others feel good about themselves. I know what it is like to hate yourself and I don't want that for anyone else. 
Well, He is going around telling people that I am this crazy mental bitch, my mother in law hates me, my husband is mentality abuse and spends all my money and waste tons of money, my youngest is a spoil brat and my oldest is dumb. All behind our back. I see the way he treats his wife and her children, I see the way he spends her money. I really think he is painting us bad to make himself feel like he is superiour that us and to distract from the fact he is all the things he is saying we are. I don't know why he is doing this. I hate to think I am going to thier picnics and his friends are looking at us like these really bad people. I really love my sister in law and my niece and nephew. It hurts me to think that my sister in law may think these things about me too. I don't know where they got this idea. My brother in law like to be disrespectful to me and get up in my face ( meaning getting in my personal space) I normally laugh it off. Maybe, He got upset and decided to not like me anymore because I started sticking up for my husband when he says lies in front of me or when he said really messed up things to my niece and her friend that are 13 years old ( he was calling them cum dumpsters and gutter sluts etc.) I found that to be very wrong and I couldn't just sit there so I said something. I didn't yell- I just said that he shouldn't talk to them that way and I will not sit here listening to him talk to that way. His wife was just allowing it and I couldn't. I know how those kinda words can cut a girl inside, even if someone is joking around. Words like those to little girls are not a joke and it isn't fun. I don't want to sound like I am talking shit on him but I am so sick over this and done. On top of everything- he told his kids that I am immature and can't support my family without living with my mother in law. This coming from a man that hasn't held a job in the last 11 years- that lives off his wife, that before his wife- he was bouncing from job to job-living in his grandmothers basement. I may live with my mother in law but that is by choice- I enjoy her company and I pay the utilities and part of our mortgage. I do the best I can. I'm so hurt that someone I looked up too ( my sister in law) could be okay with this man that treats her and her kids so poorly, is  okay with putting down her family. I tried so hard to be a good person and love everyone and spread joy. I am still only human with emotions- it is never enough. I don't know what to do- I don't want to give up my relationship with my sister in law and her kids but I don't want to look into the face of someone that must hate me so much to speak so poorly about me to strangers that don't even know me.",depression

Tales of inspiration,"Hi everyone, bit of a rough day. 
When i get a little down, i try and remeber stories of inspiration of incredible people who overcame what seemed impossible. Stories like Wilma Rudolph who was born a tiny child who suffered scarlet fever, pneumonia, and Polio. the latter took all strength from her leg and doctors feared she would never walk without a cane or worse, bound to a wheel chair. She fought and overcame all this (and much more) to win olympic gold medals in track and be the fasted woman alive in her generation. 
Here are some others i find inspiration in:
Hershel Walker, his legs were so poor as a child, like Wilma doctors told him he'd never be able to run. he bacame one of the fastest running backs in football history.
The parents of Theodore Roosevelt feared he'd never live past 20 because of his melencholy and depression. Not only did he conquer it, he became one of our greatest presidents fighting injustice. 
Wiston Chirchhill was Dyslexic as a child.
Albert Enstien failed High school

They transfer me to Medical Services, and I hang up after being on hold for 15 fucking minutes. I LEFT WORK EARLY FOR THIS SHIT. I NEED HELP. I AM IN FUCKING PAIN.

FINALLY!!!.....now what?,"Back in January I posted a rant about trying to get a councilor and the silly hoopes my insurance wanted me to jump through. Dear Lord it could almost drive you to depression just trying to get HELP for depression! Well success! I will be attending my first counciling session on thursday of the upcomming week. 
It has been well over fifteen years since i have gone to a councilor (let alone a male one, i'm much more comfortable with Females) and i'm just wondering what makes a 'good' councilor nowadays? what makes a 'bad' one? It's a curiosity i've been pondering and wonder if some of you can give me some of the 'good', the 'bad', (got the ugly covered lol) of modern day counciling????Love you all.",depression
It’s all too much,"I try and I try, but nothing changes. I wonder if I’m really trying or am I just going through the motions. I’m so tired of all the nonsense. I can’t seem to catch a good day. Every time I think I’m seeing the light, it goes dark. I started praying again. Something I haven’t done in many years. I’m wondering if that was really a good idea. Only because I feel like it’s making me worse. Like I’m not good enough for saving. I still try. Hoping one day something might click. I don’t know what to do now. I’m stuck in this pit of despair and I see no end to it. I’ll still get up and do what I have to do, but I don’t think it’s enough anymore. ",depression
I Can't Do It,"Don't ask me how or why, but as much as I may sometimes want to, I can't kill myself. Call it me being stubborn, call it me being weak.

abandoned by support person,"Someone once told me that adults can't be abandoned.  I guess I sort of see what this means. Do I agree with it? I don't know. 
I used to be in a support group where people would exchange numbers, in my case the person was a mentor and so the relationship was more one-way. The way that it was set up was for newer people (myself) to call more experienced people to help the ones who were calling them.  Over time, it began to be more two-way and we did become friends. The lady and I became friends and she was more like a mom or grandmom figure, and we started going to coffee and lunch she even invited me for Christmas once, which was pretty cool. She is very religious and really into the Bible. I am only moderately religious and go to a different church so I was not really down with this. My unfortunate experience with extremely religious people is that they tend to be rather intolerant. She had seen me through a lot and I listenened to her as well.  I thought, especially after spending the holidays at her house, we were fairly good friends.
She is now not speaking to me. 
The last time that I called her she was out of town and she said to call her when she got back, which I did.  I called her once a week for the last six weeks, and now I realize that that's it. She refuses to pick up.  I understand that having me as a person to emotionally support probably is pretty draining, but i have other people too, and she is not the only person in my life. I try to avoid being that energy vampire person. Well I probably didn't do a good job. If we were just phone friends I could see...but we had gotten to be actual friends...and now she cut me off completely. To be honest I am pissed off. If supporting me was a drain she could let me know that she was not up for supporting me all the time and I get it, I have other ways to find support, but to just unilaterally end the relationship completely?!?  I have lost respect for her and I will say it's not the first time someone really religious has tried to convert me, be really nice and all about Jesus, and then turn their back on me. I'm mad. Five years of being friends with this person and now nothing to do...when we'd meet, she was late all the time, I'd be in the middle of lunch halfway through eating and she'd just barely show. Well praise the lord, what a bunch of garbage. Well I guess I was too much for her but you thought she'd have known that a while back?",depression

Emotional wreck..,I haven't been on here in a long time but right now I just need someone to talk to.. for the past couple of weeks I have been having so many break downs where I'll just cry for no reason and I just feel so trapped..

My life has been built on lies. I trust no one. ",depression
Family Feud Confusion,"Whew, I haven’t been in the groups for a while, but I thought it was time to come out of my private journalling shell because I feel truly conflicted.
My dad has narc tendencies, and for a lot of my life I have been resentful of him. Resentment builds up over the years into something very strong. I have felt for years as if I am tiptoeing around, attacked, discouraged, just all around unloved. No physical abuse, but I suppose it counts as emotional. Constant criticism, withholding affection and praise, put-downs, all that. He also can have explosive meltdowns that have left me utterly terrified of him (he screams and throws stuff, usually doesn’t actually do anything drastic. But he once badly bruised my mom, and I have been deathly afraid of him hurting us ever since.) 
All my life, I have felt as if I am always defending myself against him. To this end I acted like a stubborn little shit, getting provoked easily and throwing back defensive retorts. But he feels as if he is being targeted, hurt. 
It’s the first time I truly realized it, but he ironically feels the same way I do. 
My mother and his wife is abusive towards him, he is socially awkward, and has a tendency to internalize, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he were emotionally unbalanced as I hypothesize.   
He is a genuine person, but his methods are completely wrong. He does actually try, but he goes about it wrong. He does actually love me, but feels anxious and hurt. We have tried for years to get him to change his ways, but he doesn’t listen and continues to act this way towards me. 
I don’t know how I know, but he strongly reminds me of an abusee that grew up into an abuser, and isn’t aware that what he’s doing is wrong. 
And here is where I have trouble. The other day he was acting aggressively and erratically towards me because I was expressing annoyance. I felt incredibly anxious and all the resentment from the years blew up, I went through a depressive and angry phase, was crying, and a few hours later I ended up publicly shouting at him in a restaurant. When we got home he shouted at me back. Since then family life has been incredibly awkward, and whatever it is, it’s driving me insane. He is incredibly hurt by what I did and went through his own depressive phase, which made me feel bad. He legitimately does not understand why I act the way I do towards him. I myself am going through depression worse than I’ve had in ages.
The situation worsened when two days ago I left the stove on by accident for about three hours, and upon discovering it he had one of those meltdowns that completely terrifies me. I locked myself in my bathroom for four hours because I felt so afraid and unsafe. Because of that incident I have even more resentment towards him, and I know it must be twisting my judgement. 
I do not want to apologize, though I know I have things to apologize for, simply because he would think apologizing is submission. The last time I did it, he got even angrier at me. But I also know apologizing would probably absolve the situation- I’m just scared that it would be me backing down again, accepting the bullshit that is his parenting methods. I think I am justified in believing his methods are wrong, and rejecting them. I think I am justified in wanting him to do what we’ve been asking him to do for years- leave me the hell alone. And in some twisted way, this-not apologizing or acknowledging anything- is my way of standing my ground.
But I’m also realizing it’s wrong. It’s just damaging me, and everybody. But I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of getting judged for what I did wrong (yelling at him in public). I don’t know what to do about this situation. I just wish I’d had a mature and normal dad. I wish I didn’t have to step up and be mature about this. 
I just want this crisis to end, I want me feeling bad constantly to end, but I also don’t want to go back to the way things used to be, which I know has a 99% chance of happening as my dad has never been one to change his ways. And I’m not sure what to do. I have not had support in my life from people around me, so it has been disproportionately difficult 
I kind of just want to put everything out there... and figure out what it all is outside my narrow and twisted perception.

Transitioning into pure sadness,"lately I’ve been soooo depressed and angry and mad at myself. For gaining so much weight, for having yet another failed Relationship, for graduating from college only to be disappointed and dissatisfied, for not wanting to interact with my own child because I just can’t keep pretending to be happy or interested and then I get mad at myself for not being happy and interested at least in her. I fall asleep to late and wake up late feeling like a bum, I still have to tell my daughter that the only dad she knows will be moving out soon and that we are not together. It’s gonna break her heart and it’s all my fault. For choosing another failed relationship. On top of that my stupid eating disorder is controlling me and body dysmorphia reminds me of the fat disgusting ugly person I am and all of this just makes me want to curl up and die. If I’m not gonna be any use to myself or my child or my field then what’s the point. I know I won’t kill myself because my daughter is my world whether my depression allows me to show it or not but I know that if she wansnt here I would of been gone. Sucks to feel that way and to know that. And to cry all the time and talk to her with my face away from hers so that she can’t tell I’m drowning in my own tears. She is so innocent and deserves someone who wants to watch her dances and color with her and laugh with her and I just can’t. I hope this all changes. I seen a therapist and got on new meds but so far nothing is helping me. I just don’t wanna keep feeling lost and lonely. ",depression
Falling Deeper,"I used to belong to this group but after my depression kinda took a backseat to my anxiety, I thought it would be best to focus on that aspect of my mental health.
This last week, my depression has come back full swing. My friend has Cystic Fibrosis and she's in the end stages of it. She's only 24 years old and probably has a couple weeks, if that, left to live unless she gets a lung transplant. And even with the lungs, she has a bad heart and would need a new one as well. She's a fighter and always has been but it's so difficult to watch the pain she's experiencing. She just had a feeding tube put yesterday morning because she can't keep any food down. Her lungs are functioning at about 14% right now and I pray for her to be at peace every day.",depression

im also sacred of getting better. which sounds so stupid. but I've been suicidal and so depressed for so long now i cant ever imagine myself happy. i don't deserve to be happy. im scared of getting better also because this disorder is all i have. its who i am. i dont have a personality. i had this disorder for my whole life. its the same feeling with my eating disorder. who am i without theses things. but i do want to get better, i just dont know how to let go. im scared. people only loved me when i was sick. im just so scared of getting better which sounds so stupid. i dont want to live in this hell anymore. i want to feel free and happy but its also scary, it so scary and i dont know how to explain it all. im just scared. just scared of living.

Sad realization,"Has anyone here realized in their 50's or later that their family of origin actually does not love them?  That they are being used and when the chips are down, their family is not there for them.  Especially, in my case, my mom who i thought was my best friend is actually not a real friend at all.

Seroquel...my nightmare,I went on Seroquel on May 17th.  I started feeling bad right away.  I sent a message to my doctor on June 10th saying I was feeling sad and we needed to go back to my Zyprexa. He said he would let me know what the board of psychiatry wanted to do. Well a week later their response was to raise my dosage to 300mgs. I slowly descended into hell. I began to feel hopeless.  I stopped eating. I couldn't sleep. My thoughts turned dark. I told my doctor that I couldn't be on this anymore.  I  was feeling hopeless. I wanted my Zyprexa back.  He said he would talk with the board. That Friday my husband took me to Seattle.  We stayed in a hotel downtown on the 10th floor.  He opened the windows.  When he told me that there were stoppers in the windows I got upset.  I wanted to jump. We came home the next day.  On Sunday I had thoughts of taking a knife to my wrists. Monday I sent a message to my doctor asking if he had heard from the board. I didn't hear back.  So I sent a message explaining what suicidal thoughts I had and my doctor called me and told me that they decided to give me back my zyprexa. I am on my final 25mg tablet  tonight.  I will be so glad to have it out of my system. That stuff is poison. ,depression
Too tired of trying,"I literally feel sick. I can't stand it, I don't have anything to live for. I would pay someone to shoot me dead. It would be a blessing. Last weekend someone I knew and stayed in touch with died by suicide. I wish I could have told her that she wasn't alone, that I've thought of doing the same thing off and on for almost two decades now. We were kindred souls she was I writer like me, when we'd chat we'd talk about so many different things and she'd ask me how my writing was coming along. Needless to say I will miss her terribly. My heart aches that I will never talk with or see her again. I'd sometimes vision us one day in the future the two of us sipping our mimosas as successful authors and toasting to our happy creative lives, but that day will never come. Needless to say this has chipped away at what little resolve I had to stay here. I'm tired of hurting all the time, I don't forsee myself staying alive for much longer. I have no money, friends, significant other, ...nothing or no one. I don't have a will to go on anymore. My life has been nothing but misery and no matter what I try I can't get out of it. I wish I had never been born at all and I mean that. ",depression
4 Days Left,"In 4 days it will be 15 years since cancer claimed the life of my wonderful Nan and I had my world shattered around me, 15 years since i carried her, supported her and watched helpless as she took her last breath holding my hand and taking my heart and my family with her.

medication,"I was hoping to get off seroquel for sleep, but that is not going to happen.  I was getting by on 50 mg per night and that was going alright. Suddenly that changed and I kept waking up after 2-3 hours, like clockwork.  No matter what I did or why, always woke up.  Exercise during the day, wind down at night, was up after 2-3 hours, so the doc put it back at 100 mg, was really disappointed because I was hoping that I could get off of it completely. I was probably focusing on it way too hard anyway and made it worse. Was up back at 4:30 AM again. Probably because I am looking for work now anyway. Making everything worse. Well back up it is. Didn't get out of the house until noon today. ",depression
The Last Time,"I was raised differently then most I've never fit in anywhere or with anyone. I was always the loner outlasted by everybody one way or another. In my world people weren't nice to you unless they wanted something the nicer they were the more they wanted from you and that included members of my own family. I have long since let go of these people and no longer consider any of them my family any longer. Trust was not a word I knew and something I never gave anyone, I spent years building walls around my heart I eventually  let a very select few within those walls and built my own family. But it didn't come without a price, I let my guard down when I shouldn't of and had my secrets spread and my weakness thrown back into my face. Needless to say the walls went back up bigger and thicker then they ever were. Nobody got anywhere near close to me or my heart for many many years. I suffered so many losses and my isolation was made deeper by me pushing away the few I had let in. 

I thought by coming to this site of like people my trust would not be broken and my secrets would be safe here. Unfortunately I was wrong I opened myself up to someone and let them in deeper than I've let anyone in in years and recently my world was shattered by them in the worst way. I become very close to this person they became my confident and anchor in this world when things got to bad and I started sinking into my depression. He could pull me out and talk me down from panic attacks like no one ever has before. And now after 2 years of that kind of friendship and closeness I barely speak to him. His reason, his new girlfriend doesn't like our daily texts and chats and the close bond we formed. She's known about me from the beginning and now all of a sudden has a problem with me in his life. So instead of coming to some type of compromise we go from talking everyday throughout the day to barely holding a conversation after days without speaking. 

So this the last time I ever open myself up to anyone ever again. I'm tired of be hurt and replaced I can't do it again. My walls have once again been raised but this time they will stand tall and strong never to be knocked down again. I'll go back to the cold hearted bitch this world has turned me into. ",depression
Crippling Me,"I get these horrific waves of depression-- they come on suddenly and they leave me almost in tears. I don't know what to do about it. I am sick of the pain-- and believe me that I'm not just talking about psychological pain. It PHYSICALLY HURTS. Things are coming along at work-- sort of. Friday was horrible. I need more help and more training in my department. They've trained me on a bunch of other things, all of which are very interesting and worthwhile, and I'm glad I'm learning them. But it takes away from my ability to get things done in the pharmacy, and everyone there seems to forget that I am the only pharmacy technician there right now. I cannot fill everything for everybody STAT. I know I bring a lot of this on myself, because they've told me they don't expect me to fill everything or get everything done. But Friday was so bad-- I was assigned two trainings, both of which were very good but they were an hour long each, so it took away from my time processing fills. I had a lot of phone calls to make, a lot of stuff didn't get done, had to make four fucking phone calls to a Walgreens to phone in a script on a doctor's behalf. And one of our patients was coming out of anesthesia and barked and howled at the top of his lungs nonstop. FOR TWO STRAIGHT HOURS. Yeah, that did not help my migraine. I'm trying to make this work, because I want it to work. But when you factor in that I am seriously depressed and can't see anyone for medication management right now, it's just a ton to deal with. And my AC has been uninstalled since I moved in and sleeping has been impossible. I raised hell with my HOA so finally they are getting it installed tomorrow. But it's seriously cooler outside than it is in my condo. I'm in the process of getting health insurance through the marketplace (since at my last job I had benefits through my employer) and it's been a real headache. Sometimes I just wish I could close my eyes and everything would just stop. I wish I could have peace.

controlling people (again),"Still thinking about how I want to handle controlling people (again).  There are some people, or one in particular, who seems to be content or would like to cut me off from other people that I've had relationships with for a long time and that makes me really nervous.

Super Stressed,"So, my second day at my new job was yesterday, and the only other pharmacy technician was off for the day. So it literally was just me, and I still had almost no idea what I was doing. Because it was my second fucking day there. Everyone was really nice and willing to answer my questions, which I did appreciate. But seriously?! My stress was through the roof. Way to almost give me a fucking aneurysm. I'm sorry, but I was not okay with that. I know I made a few mistakes, and a lot of refills did not get processed, which was partially my fault and partially the fault of the brainless vet tech in the front who kept promising same-day refills, which apparently they are NOT supposed to do. They are supposed to say 24-48 hours turnaround time. Fortunately, management did talk to her about that. But I was not okay with any of this. And then I had what should've been a 30-minute commute actually took over an hour because some moron got in an accident on the highway. No I am not sorry for them because they fucked with my commute when I'd already had a rotten day. LEARN TO FUCKING DRIVE. Right now, I'm trying to remain calm before I start my third day and not get riled up. I need to be calm and collected. So DO NOT tell me to be grateful. That makes it worse. DO NOT ask me if I take meds. I do. DO NOT suggest I practice meditation. Tried it, epic fail. I keep telling myself that I've only been there a few days and that I need to give it time. That's what I'm telling myself. But I was seriously shell-shocked by yesterday. DO NOT FUCKING DO THAT TO ME is what I want to say to them. I won't, but I seriously had to restrain from totally losing it yesterday. I'm proud of the fact that I was able to respectfully communicate my stress overload to someone and they helped me.

Little help from my friends,"Hi everyone
Been a while since i was on. Things have been going better, much better. But there is always the feeling of the ground below is actually thin ice. My job is stable, I'm living on my own now, working out and improving health, the work on my book and art is doing well. But i'm wanting to make the next step instead of just resting on my work. I seem to be bulding well and want it to continue into success.
Now that i'm on my own (my mother is now in a good situation). It's been ten years since my last date and I want to start seeking for a good person in my life. i read many of your posts here and see a difficult world to return to. can i ask you all for some advice in what you (women) are looking for and advice (men) on what to steer clear of? My personal belief is that a relationship NEEDS to be more than skin deep and involve the whole of a person; mind, body, and soul. I would be intersted in others and what they feel is a healthy relationship and the important ingredients needed to succeed. 
This is a good sight for reaching out when you need help, I feel that many of you have valuable advice from life that could help me and hopefully some of the words i've said help you. Love",depression

constructively dealing with challenges,"The primary sources for depression are physiologic, our body makeup, and life challenges.  As to life challenges, sometimes we're upset over things that we cannot control and other times how we responded and our limitations.  I made a significant mistake, unfortunately I am not well-organized.  I am happy about how I responded and perhaps this approach can help others, 1. Candid but limited (im time) self-evaluation  Own that you made a mistake and write it down.  Its like your boss or coach dressing you down.  2. Identify cause and solutions  Usually there is not one cause of a problem but several, so try to identify what could be done better.  Self-improvement is hard so you might go through this process several times, and your improvement may not be complete.  However, candid-self evaluation can make you better.  I used to lose things when I was little, baseball gloves, jackets, school books, and felt bad and sometimes did not want to tell my parents because of the cost.  Now, I try to develop a program- leaving a hotel I take a comprehensive check of everything in the room, I'm one of the last people off the plane after again checking.  Still can lose things in other circumstances, but it is getting better. 3. Compliment yourself   If you do go through 1 and 2 diligently, compliment yoursel for your success, against don't expect complete change.  If a student doing poorly in math raises his grade from F to C-, he is doing better.  Don't keep focusing on your failure and instead recognize that you have taken meaningful action to improve yourself and that is all that can be done.  4. Work on accepting that which you cannot change  You may have other things in life that cannot be changed,  consider what can be done long or short-term and somethings need to be accepted.  Many people who work in household are depressed about their jobs, but I saw a woman in Aruba.  She said she worked for a hotel as a housekeeper and had a wonderful life- sometime things are a matter of perception.  Good luck.  I am not happy I screwed up, I am happy that perhaps I can use this to make someone else's life better.      ",depression
Feeling lost,"So yesterday my nephew got his braces put on and he spent the night with me. He woke up hurting and after giving him some tylenol I just talked to him a while about funny stuff and I mostly talked about when I was younger in HS and had more friends and all the fun things we did. After he fell asleep I stayed awake wondering what happened to that girl she was happy or at least I had friends to do things with but I was always socially awkward. I just managed to be like ""hey i'm not popular or get asked out on dates (I was overweight in school only lost weight after I graduated) but at least i have some friends to not be popular with"" now those friends are married and moved on. While here I am sad, lonely and tbh I feel lost. 
I want a good job and an apartment but then there is the part of me that is thinking ""you can't hold down a job you don't even know what you want to do in life because most of your day is spent worrying about anxiety attacks and if you are really depressed or not""
See now i'm wonderng if i'm depressed or just lazy and then I start to think maybe I should take medication for my depression/anxiety but then I think ""why can't you figure this out youself what if you aren't depressed and you don't need the medicine"" 
Is that anxiety or just paranoia? I know that I used to love going and doing things with friends and family now its a chore to get out of bed, i'm embaressed when I cant afford things, feel the dissapointment from my family when I don't get the job and then dissapointment in myself when I secretly am a bit relieved because even though I want the job I also desperatly don't want the anxiety that comes with it.",depression
"After a decade, my depression feels different","I have been struggling with depression and daily suicide ideation since losing someone very close to me about 9.5 years ago. I always thought about ending it all, and made plans in my head. There were a handful of times where I attempted, but (obviously) did not succeed. Lately, my depression has felt different. It is so terrifying, because after so much time I don't even recognize this feeling. It feels more serious, and like I'm going to lose control and finally end it soon. Like I said, I used to plan when I would end it. Now, it feels like the end is just lurking in the dark for me and I don't know when or where it will jump on me. The biggest difference that could be causing this feeling is that I racked up a fairly large amount of debt last year, and it makes me feel as if there truly is no hope and no way out. Before, I always felt like that. But now, it feels like the cold, hard truth that I cannot escape.
I truly don't know what to do because it just feels like I'm waiting for myself to lose control and end everything once and for all. Half of each day lately has been me thinking about not being on this earth anymore and being relieved at the thought. Winding up in a hospital used to sound so terrifying, but now it's like I want it to happen so that I can escape reality for a bit. None of this makes sense to me, even though I've had this illness for so long.",depression

This may belong in Anxiety,"but I’ve been taking my meds & I think my anxiety is more or less under control 
i am having a feeling like being punched in the stomach with an acute sadness that always exists but ebbs & flows. Even yesterday I was watching a horror movie w my daughter & I was having the best time & told her so 
And then ... ouch. Ouch ouch ouch ouch. It was back. And it’s like contractions. It’s a very heavy feeling & it exists around my stomach. And it’s awful. 
We found a nicer place to move. It’s smaller so that all the junk that has accumulated here has to be prioritized & tossed. I’m still packed from last move
i had to ask my very pissed off brother for money for this venture to occur. 
And my brother made me work( emotionally,you know? ) Tortured me for this money. He’s still interrogating me. I find out my mom opened her mouth & he finds out that I originally had planned to ask my brother for a higher amount of cash
I know they are my family & they care but there’s a big ole elephant in the room.... anyway
theres been lots of fights about money & about communication. 
I see my husband in the way he’s changed & hey that comes w age & he could use therapy too. 
I recently had a failed(or just aborted) suicide attempt that anybody I’ve told about it (2)& what went wrong doesn’t seem to be concerned. 
With all this above do you think this is anxiety? I’m so tired of feeling so sad & lonely & pathetic &?im tired of telling people that I feel that way. 
Do you think I should ask my pdoc to increase my Zoloft a little?( that’s not all I’m on but it’s the antidepressant)",depression
Vitamin B supplements,"Vitamin B supplements may help people to fight depression, research suggests. 
Scientists found that people with depression responded better to treatment if they had high levels of vitamin B12 in their blood.
They suggest taking vitamin B supplements may be a way to boost the effectiveness of anti-depressants.

ruminating over my decision,"I know that you are not supposed to quit your job before you get another one, but that is what I did.  Maybe it helps to get a background on some of this.  I've had a really terrible time in my career. It may even be one of the reasons that I have had so many mental health issues.  I know it's not the only one, but it's one.  I had them prior, but it's played a huge part.  To explain further, I've been a teacher for fifteen years, and it's been consistently quite bad the whole time. I've had three jobs in fifteen years.  In the last one, I taught at a small high school.  Public school was even far worse.  My pay has not moved the entire time.  About three and a half years ago I started at this private type company and started teaching high school. There were a lot of things that I liked about it.  But, there were a couple of things that were a real mess. My co-worker was severely out of control.  He was hell-bent on converting anyone in a stone's throw to his religion and then the sexual harassment started. The entire office was spinning. Managment and HR refused to handle him.  I started to fall apart.  Two years at this site.  One woman quit because he would not stop touching and caressing her, and two female students' complaints were totally ignored (teenagers).  They left the school.   Then he started in on me. The invitations to his home and time on the weekend would not stop. 
I put in for a transfer.  I suppose it was a little better.  But, at this site, another male co-worker, while not necessarily as bad, was just angry, aggressive and nasty, and would antagonize people, including myself. He would fight openly with students.  He had terrible reviews from students and another female co worker and I were afraid of him.  He just. Would. Not. Leave. Me. Alone.  I would try to eat lunch in my classroom and he would force his way into the room.  Just barge in.  And the fights in meetings were epic. My god. And he would turn on me in meetings.  Toward the end of this a psych facility moved in next door to my class office (I was in an office facility) and screaming ensued and the students and I were just beside ourselves.  We could not get through a class without profanities coming through the wall, bloodcurdling screams, and then people trying to break into my side door. Again nothing was done. I was laughed off, brushed off. I could not get anything done. So I changed my mind and said that I was not going to be signing another contract.
Ok, well now I don't have a job. Obviously I need to get another. I decided in that time frame that I would return to school, which I did.  I've been taking online classes since about March. Been at it, but the money is going to run out and I won't be able to get another teaching job and go to school too. I've committed to school.  I will just need to do a work a day job so that I can attend school at night and get out of this awful situation that I chose. But it's gonna be tough, when people look at my resume they think ""overqualified"" and they just ignore it. I want to work at an office fulltime in the day, cover myself, my benefits, get away from the insanity of this classroom garbage, not to mention the 45 min commute I was doing and just be here in town.  I'm scared no lie, but to tell the truth, I was terrified to go to work.

Life advice,"ive been battling depression and anxiety since my entire life. Lately, I’ve been constantly annoyed/frustrated by my condition. I can’t stand the fact that I could have so much potential in life but my will and enjoyment is constantly sucked out of me. I’m surrounded by friends and family that don’t deal with the issue that I deal with so it’s hard to relate to people at times. My anxiety compromises my social skills which is what’s been eating at me the most. I don’t know what to do anymore and I feel lost and empty. It sucks when people don’t understand you and I feel like if I try to explain myself, people will take me less seriously.",depression
Does speaking up help?,"I'm new here, in fact, I'm new at speaking about this. I've never reached out before, at all. I've tried, but usually shut down before I'm able to speak or type. It's currently 12:12 am where I am, I'm not in a good place.

I've been suffering in silence most of my life. I'm almost 40 now and remember vividly my suicidal thoughts and episodes of self-harm back when I was a teenager. Depression wasn't really a thing back then, you either fitted in, or you didn't. I always struggled to fit in, so of course, I learnt to hide away whenever I was in a dark place. I have only ever cried alone, hidden away somewhere, never in front of another person, never! Sometimes late at night while my significant other sleeps peacefully in the next room, I sob quietly and uncontrollably in the next room. I don't sleep well. I have only once broken down uncontrollably in public but luckily no one I knew was around so no one has ever known.  

I know I suffer from depression, I've done the quizzes and read about the symptoms. I know it, but what do I do about it? That's why I'm here, is there a better way? Before telling me yes, and telling me to speak up, hear me out. I'm not convinced that me speaking up will help anyone.

Firstly there's my medical record, if I ""speak up"", I will have an exclusion on any life insurance policy, be excluded from potential career paths, and who knows what else. Besides, are the prescription drugs really that helpful? Right or wrong I've been getting by with self-medicating my entire life. I use Marijuana to sleep (when I can get it - last 3 years + teenage years) otherwise it's been alcohol.  Then microdoses of various stimulants when I need to be ""on"" for lack of a better term. It doesn't always work out how I would like but it gets me by.

Then there's my new wife, we've been together for just over three years and we have just got married. She knows I have my off days but we leave it at that. I don't get into it and don't allow it to burden her, I deal as I always have, she's sleeping right now. She doesn't deserve nor does she need that burden! Life is full of challenges and the last thing anyone needs is a depressed partner. The only person ""speaking up"" is going to help in this instance is me, and that seems selfish. I feel guilty for even considering it! 

So, here I am, I have a healthy life insurance policy in place to look after my family without an exclusion on suicide/mental health, thanks to not ""speaking up"". I have a happy wife that I would do anything for who can go about her day without worrying whether her husband is ok. So I ask, is there really a benefit in speaking up and asking for help and if so, what? I'll still suffer from depression right? So why wouldn't I just continue as I have?
Any advice or shared experiences is appreciated, I'm feeling very lost of late, maybe it's time to try a new method. Thanks.",depression
Having a Tough Time,"Dear DS Community,
This week has been really tough for me and several members of my family. On Monday, we received bad news about my wife's cancer. Last week, we received worse news about my brother's cancer.

Down again,"I had fun this weekend hanging out with friends and laughing a lot, then today came and as usual I fall back down into depression.

Self esteem,"I recently came out to my online friends as bi. I've known them for about 7 years now. Whenever I play video games with them they call me bad, gay and such.

I walk around in a daze like I was drunk. I figured it would be better sleeping late rather than wake up early and start the misery earlier. Bad choice cause now I’m up and it’s after 1 and while my body is beat for the day, my mind won’t stop. I wish that it had an on off switch just one time so I could just be. All I want is to break out even ya know. It’s like im striving for mediocrity and even that’s impossible. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1:30am on a Friday,"So it’s almost 1:30 am on a Friday and there’s only one person in the group logged in. I hope that means everyone is doing well. I  had a rough couple days so I made some posts looking for advice and someone said something that struck me. It was about waiting till we reached the bottom before we sought out help. I’ve had thoughts like that before. When I would have a few good days I wouldn’t come here and I would just float on through the day. I would never admit to myself that this will turn back to sadness at some point. The good days, the days I have energy to do something, I should be preparing for the next bad day. I know it’s not the best thing to think about when your having that good day, and nobody thinks that it will end. At least not out loud anyway. That good day is the day I should find that therapist or make that doctors appointment. It’s the day I should go online and find some strategies for dealing with my depression. Because sadly that dark cloud always seems to come back. It’s happened countless times already so why does it still surprise me. I don’t know anyone around me that has depression so I certainly don’t know anyone who had that dark cloud go away and never come back. But it does happen for many people, I guess that’s because they are always prepared for it. ",depression
Miserable,"I feel like I'm miserable in every aspect of my life. I literally say to my friends ""I'm done"" and it's not even a big deal. It's like they dont understand or dont care I'm not sure.

So much for him needing ""time to work out his mental health"". Then my home life, my home is empty. I dont have roommates or nothing so i have no one to come home to, to tell my day to or vent or anything. I've been so depressed lately my house is a mess. Insanely. I just dont have the energy to do it. I'm so miserable and tired. I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for the universe to give me a sign but it never  comes.

Why,"Me ex husband asked for a divorce two days after I delivered our second child. I was taken by complete surprise. He decided he was in love with another woman. He had sex with his girlfriend in my house with me and our two kids above him. I kicked him out and went to file divorce. He attempted sucide all because his girlfriend was thinking of leaving him. He now lives with his girlfriend, his girlfriends husband and their three kids. He hasn’t contacted me since March, hasn’t seen his kids since December. I apparently depress him too much for him to see his kids. I don’t know why him choosing to not be in his kids lives hurts me so much. I just want to forget about him but I have the kids. I feel like something is wrong with me. ",depression
I feel done,"i have been struggling with depression since I was just a kid. I’m 51 now, not much has changed. I have been to therapy, tried many different medications. 
I’m a transplant patient. It would be easy for me to give up. All I have to do is quit taking my anti-rejection meds. I also have a huge supply of painkillers. 
I have already been screwing up my meds by accident. It wouldn’t be a huge step to just quit taking them. 
I live on my own. My kids are grown up & independant. I constantly think of how little I have to live for. And i’m tired of trying to get help that never seems to work. ",depression
Is it just me?,"whenever I see pictures of happy couples or couples in love or see couples respecting one another and treating each other like people I get depressed. it nearly brings me to tears to think about. My husband and father of my children is a bit of a bully, is often verbally or emotionally abusive and treats me like I am scum. So seeing people in relationships is depressing. I feel like this relationship is me giving him taking and leaving me with nothing left for me. When I suggest doing something for me I am called selfish. So here I sit depressed and stuck. 
Other online groups just tell me to divorce but it's not that simple. I need a way to cope that does not leave me with suicidal thoughts.. Maybe someone on here can relate and let me know I am not alone?

When life gives you lemons?,"At this point in my life I don’t know what to do. I’ve always dealt with depression but this year has been the hardest year I’ve dealt with. It started in February when at 7 months pregnant my car got hit by a plow then I was evicted from my apartment and given 7 days to move out. I then moved back to my moms and shortly after my car gets hit by a train. I was at my moms for 2 months when my boyfriend was arrested and given 3 months in jail. He was given a short furlough to get out while I was in labor but only got to see our baby for an hour before he went back. Now he is out and baby is 6 weeks old. We argue a lot and have decided to split. We had previously agreed I would stay home and he would work. We have an apartment in another city but have been staying at my moms until he finds a job where our apt is. Now me, with a 6 week old newborn still living at my moms have no money and bills are piling up. I hate to sounds “poor me” but fuck I need some support right now. ",depression
my life is chaotic and it's upsetting (trigger),"So much is changing right now, so much is tumultuous and I can't even keep track of it. It's freaking me out.  In addition to a huge career shift (which I acknowledge is of my own making). I acknowledge that I have sought for change as some of the situations that I've been in have been pretty unhealthy. But, in the interim, some things are happening of their own accord that I really don't like, things that I would not necessarily choose or want that seem to be a side effect of all the things that are going on right now.
Some relationships that I've had have been really unhealthy and I put them to the back burner. But something terribly upsetting happened and it resulted in the relationship coming to an explosive end.  I was friends with a couple who weren't up front about their intentions. I wanted ""friends."" And they were angling for an open relationship the whole time just forgot to send me the memo!!!  Why was this not easy to just drop? It got difficult. Hard.  I trusted them as my sibling and father are physically abusive, so they and their friends became my *other* family.  Little did I know what was involved. I started to gradually back out once the writing on the wall started to look really strange.
In March, there was a big incident where I attended a public event, and because I have ptsd I had to go outside to get myself together.  He followed me out there and started shouting at me, telling me that I was f****e up, and that I neeed to get on his massage table naked and smoke weed; he was very pushy, controlling, and dominating.  I was scared to death and he continued to call incessantly after that.  I was so shocked and overwhelmed that I blocked his number. I could not believe it as they used to be my friends and I trusted them. I'd stopped even going to our mutual friends' home because he was there, and when I woke up from sleeping on the couch, he'd be standing over me, almost refusing to let me leave.
Fast forward to last week.  I finally called the mutual friend and they brought it up.  The addressed the situation (I didn't know that they were aware) and they stated that they had noticed my absence and that they hoped that I would return...and that they had several complaints about him, that he had lately in the past couple of months upped the ante and started harassing and terrorizing several women at their home, hitting them up for sexual reasons that that he was read the riot act.  They stated that they didn't feel that I should have to lose my friendship with them because he was acting like an ass.  I was grateful for this, but I also got a little hysterical on the phone too.  It's just been terrible, with what has happened at work, all around. I feel like I live in fear all of the time and that I have no where to go, that I will have no where to go for the holiday. I'm so tired of feeling like this.  I used to live with a lot of domestic violence and I hate the feeling of looking over my shoulder and that I can't even trust people who I think I should.  The worst part was when he said, ""you think you are going to escape, dont' you."" This was horrible because 30 years ago I was pretty much in a hostage situation and the police had to come get me.  I hate my life sometimes.  At least I am going to somatic therapy otherwise I dont' know if I'd leave home.",depression
Horrifying Nightmare,"Last night, I had a dream that I wanted to die. After realizing this, someone injected me with a lethal poison, and I knew I would be dead within seconds. The paradoxical twist is that after being injected, and actually KNOWING that I was dying, I became absolutely terrified. The last part of the dream was everything fading to black and my last thought was I WANT TO LIVE! I woke up immediately afterwards completely freaked out. I think this dream allowed me to see that there is a very different feeling between wanting to die and knowing that you are going to die very soon. ",depression

Tonight I got depressed out of nowhere and was danger close to breaking a pencil or something like that just so I could cut.. and I am just slowly losing it. I've been an emotional wreck lately.. I keep listening to my 'cutting music' playlist because when i feel depressed it may be weird. But. It's how I keep myself alive...",depression
Feeling pretty down tonight,"The stressors keep mounting.  I woke up yesterday morning almost shaking from the anxiety i was feeling. I'm in some possible legal trouble now, nothing too awful, but still...  I've been off work again, i think i have been off sick this year alone at least two months.  not good.  hanging on by a thread at work.  lots of physical and mental problems. 
i've been alone far too long and it's taking a toll.  i need help.  i need someone to help me practically and to be on my side emoitionally and i don't really have that.  wow, just to get a back rub and have someone go to the store for me a couple of times.  that would be huge.  and getting older, i can't shoulder all this responsibilty.  i'm literally being crushed, my joints and bones giving out from working so hard and so much hardship.  has anyone else experienced this, working your body so hard that you actually become disabled?  this is what is happening to me and that's pretty much all i've known to survive.  working.  as long as i can work i can pay my bills and get food and shelter but if i can't work...  
i feel like i'm just slipping down, down, and going to wind up just laying somewhere, curled up and resting no matter what the consequences. my body is just saying, enough!  i just can't physically do it anymore and mentally, too, i'm at my limit.  what's sad is i am so close to retirement, less than a year, and i wanted to make it because if i don't i lose out big time financially.
well, i'm a regular here so i thought i would post.  i'm trying, i'm not giving up but had a couple of new,big challenges pop up on top of the usual so it's been really rough.
thanks for reading.",depression

wish i wasn't alone,"Hello everyone, I have been feeling depressed since my divorce 5 years ago, it was an abusive marriage and had no option to dissolve it, we have two children, and i must say i have almost everything a man will ever want in life. but there is this fear that comes in whenever i think about settling down and moving on, it reminds me of my past, but at the same time i am very lonely, i feel more depressed knowing that i am going to retire in a month time with nothing but a big house to live in all by my self.",depression
Stressed out!!!! Need advice.,"So things are really hectic for me at the minute. I dont work due to my severe depression and im in a private rented house at the moment problem is im paykng an extra 145 ontop of my rent as im in a nicish area. Iv been offered a flat from a housing accossiation for me and my 2 daughters. But the flat is in a rougher area and is about a 10 15 minute drive to their school. Also my ex mother in law would be living across the road if i accept this flat. I dont know what to do for the best. Stress is a major cause of me going down hill and i have ended up in hospital before because of it so im worried about everything just crumbling.
I have asked everyone i know what they think is best but they just say its up to me and they cant tell me what to do. But right now thats all i want is someone to say this is the best option choose this. If i do move my car insurance goes up and petrol costs so am i really saving that much? I dont know. Everything just seems so hard right now and every little decision seems too much never mind this huge one i have to make within the next couple of days. 
I drive the kids to school now anyway but its literally a few minutes in the car so not a problem and althought my weight has become a major issue (medication has caused me to balloon to over 20st) i know if the car fails me i can walk them even though it would bw a struggle mentally and physically. I keep trying to lose the weight but then something happens and i binge of rubbish. So thats getting me down ALOT as i feel like my life is just not going anywhere. 
I dont know what to do and i dont know where to turn and these are only the major things that need sorting asap. Thats not including all the other day to day crap thats getting ontop of me.

Any help or advice is appreciated and im sorry for the essay ",depression
Has this really helped anyone out there..???,"My life has been so insane that it would be unbelieveable. It makes a lifetime movie look like something Disney came up with. 
I've been to therapy and support groups off and on for 16 years. It just never seemed to help. Maybe I was speaking with the wrong people....i don't know. But with my situation this is my only option right now......
Does this really help??? Are there people out there that truely understand???
Well here it goes....lets see.....
 I was so distarcted in my life of being a wife and mother, I guess I was happy and had no reason to be depressed. After 8 years of faking a smile and pretending i'm ok.....it began to fall around me. Things slowely it went down hill as my marriage began to fail. This followed a divorce, lost my boys in custody hearing, being homeless, miscarriage, then the lost of my Grandpa (the only good man to ever be in my life), then unhealthy relationships, drugs, & drinking was the only thing I felt at that time could fix my problem. Well that didn't work out well. My depression has only gotten worse.....
I'm not lucky enough to have a close net family and I have few friends. 
I'm at the pointing of breaking, I need to socailize and talk to others. I can't stay in this state. Please, anyone out there that can honestly relate at all, maybe even a little.

Just a Self-Reflection- Feel Free to Skip,"I opened up to my therapist about my suicidal attempts, and she asked me: “Why did you do that? Why did you think that was the only choice?” I was unable to give a response. 
I thought about those questions once again. Why? 
Was it because I’ve had suicidal thoughts before and thought they would go away, so then I waited until my condition felt irreversible?
Or maybe it was because I tried to tell my mom about my feelings and she refused to seek help at a time recovery would be so easy for me. Because she believes suicidal ideation is no big deal if it isn’t acted upon.
So I wasn’t sick enough.
I attempted suicide, and my therapist warned my mom not to take it lightly, even if it’s just a “minor” thing. Both my previous counselor and my current therapist strongly recommended her to take me to a mental hospital or something. No, not strongly recommend. It’s like they were commanding her to do that, even if that made me uncomfortable. My mom asked if I was uncomfortable, and I said yes. And so she didn’t take me to a mental hospital. I asked her: “Why didn’t you do what the therapist said?” She told me it was only one suicide attempt, and the chances of me dying from self-suffocation are extremely low, therefore it isn’t a big deal and I can pass through it in no time!
Hah!
Maybe that’s why, but that still raises more questions than answers.
Well, thanks for reading this post.",depression
idk,my mom thinks i am pregnant because i haven't got my period nut like my period usually does this and im telling her and shes not listening she just wants to take me to the doctor and check and tbh i don't care because i know i'm not pregnant i just don't want them to find the weed in my system but i think i could just tell them not to disclose that but she took my phone and she doesn't even pay for it i do now i cant talk to my boyfriend and i just wanna kill myself and im home alone with no phone,depression
why are people so ignorant?,"I don't understand or comprehend how when you have been stuck in a deep, deep, dark depression that goes on for a year or longer, why people think you are making a choice to feel that way. They think you are choosing to be negative and you just want to be a downer. They seem to think you just have to make a decision to not be depressed and it will magically go away. I just dont get with all the material available online and elsewhere explaining in detail what deep depression really is, they either dont care enough to understand or they dont believe it. They think you are intentionally trying to be a miserable person. They think you can will your way out of it. Thats what I deal with. People think Im rude,  boring, lazy and they assume they know what I think and feel. Just had to get that out. Theres nobody to turn to when they cant understand.

Vicious cycle,"I tried to step out of my box. I've been single for almost 4 years, tried dating here and there but I always seemed to get forgotten and finally said ok let's give the nice guy a try, good for 2 months and then he gets his and then I start getting ghosted. I ask him what is going on he says he has this big secret that's causing him to recluse and he needs to clear his head and goes away for the weekend. Me being genuinely concerned for his mental health, about a week later I messaged him to see how he was doing and he reads it and ignores me. I feel like i seriously cant catch a break on the dating scene.  I'm sick and tired of being alone. I want someone to share my life with not someone who comes in makes me feel some type of way and then walks out. I hate always being the third wheel around my friends and not being able to relate when they talk about couple things. I go thru the same motions everyday and I finally say you know what maybe you can be vulnerable and this is what I get? I feel like I'm genuinely starting to hate my life and I dont know what to do. I dont want to let another human have this effect on me but seriously what is wrong with me that I cant even get a response back, not even a ""thanks for checking on me but I'm not ready yet"" like a grown adult, or hell a human should have the decency to say to another human.

so depressed cant make decisions,"i will soon be 60 and in an unhappy marriage, have been for 15 years.
If i dont leave soon i could end up trapped here for ever .
some days i just go about my days and persuade myself that things are not too bad. there are a lot of people worse off than me.
I am so depressed that i struggle to decide what to eat for dinner never mind if i should leave. been on loads of anti depressants but they did not help much. now i have just given up. i have also had cbt but i just went round and round in circles and did not move on. I dont feel that there is anything i can do about this depression.
My husband is secretive, a liar, constantly hides financial matters and other things from me, doesnt care about my feelings as he constanlty looks at naked girls on his phone, computer etc. and also sites like doging, massage parlours etc. he never comes near me anymore. i told him that i feel inadequate but he still continues to do it. 
I cannot ask him anything or talk to him as i will just get the silent treatment or worse a tantrum.
however he works hard, he is not having sex with other women i dont think. i have a comfortable lifestyle but i fear having to care for him in out old age or for him to have to care for me.
i know that i have the choice to either move on or just accept that that is how he is and stay put. He is not going to change i know that now. 
can anyone provide any advice ? should i just count my blessings ?

I’ve been cycling rapidly,"the last few days have been very bad. As I always think: the worst I’ve ever felt. Seen the doc. Seen the therapist. Went out for a social event. On my own. ( bravo)But when I hit the wall I hit it HARD. Today my 21 year old daughter held me while I cried & cried & talked & talked. My daughter has bullimia & has had one manic episode. Years ago before I left the social workers at the ED center she was at decided mother was to blame & she’d be better off living apart from me. We are working on her bullimia with a team of medical drs. She has a pdoc but refuses to stay in therapy. We have a very good diologue about it imo. 
I tell you this bc it somehow pertains to my story.
My middle daughter & I butt heads & she likes to come to the rescue however she lacks empathy.But she did kiss me on the forehead bf she left & said I love you mom( 2 days ago she claimed she no longer had a mother)
my oldest is a true daddy’s  girl  that’s ok  She has a steady girlfriend in California who disapproves of me bc I’m an ignorant old lady who isn’t hip with the current language of political correctness. My oldest may be the only one who behaves as tho she may be embarrassed of me in front of her friends  But I don’t know.Shes had bouts of depression & there is usually a trigger but I’ve always taken her for immediate help  she always eventually opts out of the given therapy even tho she says she believes therapy should be mandatory once a year..I have a terrible memory of her staying home from a family vacation bc she was so depressed  I had to stay home to take care of the animals & at the time I was so fully in the throes of a combo mania depression it was like stepping on the gas & break at the same time  I couldn’t help her  it was all about me  I did take her to a therapist ASAP tho.
i have lots of terrible memories of my parenting & my illness.
So I google what is it like to be the child of a mentally ill parent.It horrified me.I could not get a morsel of good news . I am an ogre who damaged & continues to damage my children.
I noticed a lot of these mentioned parents either refused treatment or were undiagnosed.So I google the same & added & the parent has been getting help
Nothing.
So I google children of parent who has always continued to seek help but it isn’t working 
Still nothing.
im tired of writing I’m sure you’re tired of reading but I’m feeling a lot of regret  If I had tried harder I wouldn’t have gotten so freaking sick

New here....,"This is my first post.  I'm not really sure how this whole thing works.  I don't know how much or how little to say.  I'm not even sure anyone will notice that I'm here as it seems no one does on any form of social media. 
I've been chronically ill for nearly one year now.  It has taken a major toll on my mental health.  I'm sad and depressed more often than not.  I don't have any close friends nearby or really very many at all.  I spend most of my time alone with the exception of my dog and two cats. 
I suppose that I don't expect much to come of this, but it always helps to at least get the words out because I'm just not sure how much longer I can go on living like this.  My heart has lost nearly all hope that I'll get better and be able to move forward sometime soon.  Not to sound so poor me.  For many, many months I have been optimistic, but the longer I am sick the less optimism I feel.  ",depression
Scary stuff happening,"the dog wakes me up at 5:30 every morning to be fed & medicated. I usually have breakfast & my meds then & then lie down for a little more rest. This did not used to be me. I used to be a horrible insomniac up for the day by 3 am. Now I cannot get enough sleep.
well this morning I woke up with the most palpable dread I ever remember having. I’m sure his is a usual occurance but every time it’s like a punch in the stomach. I was ready to cash it in this morning & the urge was nearly irresistible. 
I chose to go back to sleep & I woke a couple of hours later. I felt relief tho still sad.  It was bizarre & scary & I don’t understand what’s happening & im afraid of my distintigrating mind ",depression
I don’t know,"I don’t really get what’s going on with me. My depersonalization is constant and I’m so scared about it. I almost get at times to where I just feel nothing.

Lost,"I have struggled with things for a long time, I don't even known what to call it. I wasn't even sure what group to write in about this. But I feel lack of personality, and maybe that seems like a silly thing to be upset about. but sometimes I get lost in the thought that im empty, I'm just a shell. All I do on this planet is wonder is go through the motions, just doing what I have to do to get to the next day. I feel hobbies can really connect you with people and make you happy. But I lack the connection and the happiness. When I do connect with people is feels as though it is because I just adapt to what they enjoy, I say to myself yeah I like that band too. But then I see that persons passions always more than my own. This adaption that I do happens often and it feels like an allusion, like for awhile maybe I found my passion, but then it dies out. I have no real drive for anything. All I do is go to monotonus jobs that I have like being a secretary and working in a grocery store, then I go home and watch netflix. I feel like I desperately need to live vicariously through the tv shows. This makes me so sad I can't even explain. When I sit and really think over my emptiness is seems to explain all me issues in life. Why I dont feel like my friends are real, why I think I dont fit in with people, why I've never had a relationship where I actually cared about the other person and vice versa. I think people can see through me, they can recognize that I'm a fake and I have no substance. Every once and awhile I'll convince myself I'm really into, painting, movies, yoga, music etc. But then I look around and the people who truely do show passion for these things and I see clearly that its just a temporary distraction. And then after awhile I stop whatever i was trying to convince myself of and I stop doing the thing and I go back to obsessively watching netflix. I don't know what to do to stop this endless circle. I want to, ""find myself"" as cheesey as it may sound. But it's true, becuase honestly this numbing will never go away. It will get hidden by work and school, but it will always be there, haunting me.

I'm new ,"Hi, I'm marie. I've been diagnosed with depression for almost a year now. I've had a rough life, but there are good times. I hope to make friends and help other people like me.",depression
controlling people,"So, I have been in this support group for a really long time, which now seems to be folding. Some of them were semi-professionally trained to be leaders, coaches and helpers and people would pay them as life-coaches. I used to see a life coach. Those actually can be amazingly helpful.  At some point I realized that my issues and their depth were no match for amateurs, so I went to a licensed professional.  Although I do not have an official diagnosis, (well my one official diagnosis was/is depression) the other that's emerged is post-traumatic stress disorder. The reason I say is is becuase I'm seeing another professional who does a treatment called somatic experencing for ptsd and the counseling was centered around ptsd and my symptoms are that of ptsd...and I was dx with that in the past...so if it walks like a duck...anyway you get the point.
The professionals were remarkably more helpful far and beyond these amateurs, sorry to say, because they are, well, professionals and yes they do know what they are doing and I feel that I was helped immensely and that it's impacted my life. I've noticed that some of the people from the support group, one of which I sort of became friends with, she originally was a mentor whom I would call and talk to over the phone. We started hanging out here and there.  Her background is that she is from AA and that she has sponsored a lot of people, and I think that she's seen a lot of people pass away, I get it.  It also turns out she is 14 years older than me.  I don't feel that she is a peer and a match as a friend.  I don't feel that we are on the same wavelength and that this should be turned into a friend relationship.  There are too many mismatches.  She comes off as controlling and b****y, I don't like the tone in her voice, the way that she raises her voice, and the way she cuts me off when I am talking. She has a tendency to argue also, and try to make my decisions for me. She is high strung.  Before, when I was in the codepednency program, none of this was allowed, because it *is* codependent. This support group (which is falling apart now) is based upon feedback and some mentorship.  I had opened my mouth to say something yesterday and she immediately cut me off, and I just can't stand the sound of her voice sometimes. I know that one time I went over to her house to visit and another lady from her program came, and they actually had a fight! The lady got pissed off at her and said, ""You know you really are too bossy and I don't like the tone of your voice!"" And she walked out, took her off facebook, and that was it. Pretty much true. My friend had said well ""that's about her,"" but I don't think so.",depression

I’m worried because I might snap and hurt someone. And the last thing I want to do is go to jail for someone who wants the worst for me.

Here we are again,"It never seems to fail me. Whereever I go bad juju always seems to happen. Just when I think things are starting to be great my world comes crashing down and I snap back to this burtal reality that I will always and forever will be the black sheep of the family... Needless to say that for a short period of time I thought those days are over, but I guess not. So where do I begin, Oh how about the fact that im fat and can't help it. Well yeah my bed had broke and mind yoyu that its not the whole bed, I have a futon bed, the end of where you sit that's supposed to hold the mattress in place fell of from numerous, children climbing on and off my bed, from me laying down and getting up,and the most likely answer because it was old.  So there could have been numerous reasons as to why it fell off, but not the reason my grandfather had in mind... Of course my grandfather was also probably drunk while he was saying that still doesn't excuse him for saying it. Now before I continue to rant about the events that  occured within the last few days that mad me come up with the title let me just say this, yes I am on the heavier side but I've consistantly stayed the same weight from the time that I move till now. So I think that pretty much gives my fatness the clear. Now moving on... My grandfather had asked me if he can take a look at it so of course I agreed and i showed him with me lifting the mattress of the bed seeing that there was just a few items under my bed that was considered dirty. I am also not the cleanest well when it comes to my room... Anyways he the yells at me and tells me that he is getting feed up with the way my room looks because its soo dirty... i tell him ok and say i will clean it up. And then we get to this lovely morning when i get a wake phoe call from my mother screaming at me ( not really screaming ) telling me how much of a fuck up I am and how dissapointed she is with me because im just a drity person and i havent changed. So then I say ""here we are again,"" because here I am being told again just like when i was a kid and i was told that i was a dissapointment to my family and a huge fuck up but that was before they found out that i was artistcally gifted in every way possible. And then my sister cienna, who is no longer alive, was treated like the black sheep. After she died then and only then was it not ok for me to act out or feel the way i feel, or just no longer want to exist. And i feel that now no longer wanting to exist because i know that nobody will ever care or love me the same way that she did.for so long i kept all of my emotions tuck and hidden because of the fear that exposing my feeling with the ones i love would only make them hate me more, and thats something i feel like i already live with. I never got to live and experience life the way a normal girl at the age 19 -20 does. Always very reserved never done anything with a boy except send a few pictures never snuck out the house never did drugs with the exception of marijuana through second hand smoke. Never ran away from home, never skipped school, the list go on and on and on. And yet even now i am a grown ass women not even living with my parents ( living with my grandparents though ) and i still dont do what i want. I still am not reckless. Maybe in a differnt lifetime will i do those thing that i wanted to do or maybe i will live alone with a whole bunch of cats because i always live under the expectations of others needs and wants for my succsses. But regardless I still am The fat dirty girl who lost her favorite person who never seems to please anyone she befriends.  Like i said, "" here we are again.""",depression

Mind you this was right before I was set to go out to my first solo public function in years. Severe social anxiety rears it’s ugly head. And I had a history of making trouble ( due to my illness. I acted out a lot)with this group but it was long ago  
I told my husband that I didn’t feel he had my back & I talked to him about my suicidal idealization my research on the subject. That I had decided on my method & place. But in an aside suicide is a tough decision to make.
well he ranted on about how he hears about it & hears about it but doesn’t see anything happen & it’s just words & words don’t mean a thing.To tell you the truth it made me want to just do it right there & then. “ so there!”
it certainly didn’t feel very supportive or encouraging. I woke up feeling very despondent today & im grappling w the decision to do it now bf anyone is up or sludge thru another day. I’m sad. It took a lot out of me to just show up at this function I just feel sad & disappointed in myself that I am so sad. I’ve run everywhere. I feel I’ve tried everything in my power to feel better. To “ try” as everyone puts it. I have no place left. I feel incredibly alone",depression
Need book recommendations,Does anyone know of a good book to read if you are an adult who has survived physical and emotional abuse from a parent when you were a kid and is now (as an adult) is having a terrible time with coping with life and relationships?  I'm looking to get my hands on some good self help books and if anyone has suggestions i'd appreciate it.  I am also depressed and angry most of the time and have a problem with over eating  but i think at least some of this stems from my childhood abuse.  thanks.,depression

I'm not okay right now!,"I'm in a long distant relationship with my current boo. My boo added me on instagram a few days ago and I saw a couple of his pictures that he's single and trying to look for someone else. When I confronted him about it, he said it was from a couple of months ago from where he and I gotten into an argument, when I told him that I never wanted to speak to him again and that we're done.  My boo and I made up since that argument but I've been really depressed about it lately because it's starting to make me wonder if he really wants be single or is acting like he's single and wants to find someone else and cheat on me with another woman. Plus on top of that, he's not talking to me on a daily basis like he used to do in the begging and that's really got me wondering if he's cheating on me with another woman. I'm so depressed about it that I just want to self harm to take the pain away. ",depression
Is there such thing as a healthy relationship?,"I wonder if there is such thing as a healthy relationship and what would that even be.  I don't think I have ever been in one, except maybe witha childhood friend.  we just played and laughed all the time.  i don't remember any drama or powerstuggles until we grew older and apart.  but what about as an adult.  I don't think I have ever experienced a healthy relationship.  What I thought could be healthy relationships always wound up to be very toxic.  
i come from a family of abusive people so that may have something to do with it.
can anyone explain what a healthy relatinship looks like and if you have experienced one, i'd like to hear something about it.
this relates to depression in that i can't form a healthy relationship with anyone in the real world and in greatly contributes to my depression and anger.   thank you.",depression
Don't know how to feel,"I've been getting beyond depressed lately. I have a son who is a year and four months. His father and I were together until about 2 months ago but he never really wanted to do much with him. He endangered him 3 times and constantly lies and hides things so I left with my son so he doesn't get hurt. In the past 2 months he has only seen him 4 times and 2 of the times was 15 minutes or less. I'm now almost 4 months pregnant with our next kid and I just feel so alone, afraid, and depressed.",depression
Worried What Other People Think,"I've been really depressed lately. I'm starting to see that my job, tho easy, is probably not going to get me anywhere. One of my coworkers is leaving at the end of the month. I was hoping to be considered for his replacement, but they are likely hiring someone from outside.
Which is really fine since I'm not ready to take the job. It just sucks that I won't get any training for future. I just realized today that I probably won't ever be considered for a position like that because people with that job aren't allowed to have clients that are related to them. I'm related to all but a scant handful of people here.
I'm always depressed about not having money, and where I live. There are only so many hours in a day that I can work. I really miss school but that takes money too. I wish I could go back to school for free then get a good high paying job.
Yesterday was my family reunion. I didn't go to my highschool reunion. I'm always overly concerned with where I should be in life, like I have to prove something to other people. I feel like people look down on me instead of up to me. I don't want my family and peers to talk bad about me because I'm not where they think I should be in life. I always feel pressure not to fail.
I was on vacation last week week and it was like I was a different person. I didn't have to worry about anything. Now I'm back and it's like I just hit a wall of...I don't know what.",depression
Don’t know what I’m doing,"Hi I signed up to this a while ago I think but never posted before. I read lots of posts and commented on one but on a different topic. I was abused as a child by different people emotionally physically and sexually. I don’t want to make it out that it’s worse than what it is because I know people have had it worse. I suffer with anxiety and depression more so now than ever I have what I thought was a dream job now as an adult and I worked so hard to get it but now I am not so sure. I think I’m being bullied infact because I can’t do anything right but if that’s the case why was I chosen for the job. I was an internal candidate they knew what I was like and that’s why they hired me. Now I feel like I don’t want to go back, I have been on the sick for a few months now and I just don’t know what I’m doing. I could do something casual like being a food delivery guy on a push bike because I love that kind of work but it’s unreliable but I still love my dream job it’s just I don’t think I can go back. I am not sure if it’s anxiety and depression that’s making me feel this way or if it’s work. Or maybe it’s both it’s just my illness is escalating it. I could put in a bullying complaint but if I did then I can pretty much kiss goodbye to my job if I didn’t win but if I go back my anxiety and depression will get the better of me. There are laws in the uk to protect me from discrimination but there’s all sorts that they can say. So really I don’t know what to do I’m dammed if I do and I’m dammed if I don’t.",depression
"not really different than expected, still sucked","At several counselors' insistence that I have nothing to do with my parents, or have very little to do with them, I get together with them like once or twice a year.  Still, you know the crap is coming, but nothing totally prepares you.  Thank god I didn't tell them I resigned from my position and that I am retraining for a different career-that would elicit a huge explosion.  I just kept it to hobbies. So I talked about how I took a week of jazz piano lessons (a year ago) and I have to say the Glare of Rage that came from my mother's face was almost comical.  She went off on a tirade about how she'd done classical training for eight years (I didn't know this) and that apparently my grandmother was pretty much forcing her to do public performances. Granted this sounds like a lot of pressure and stressful.  It does explain why my mom was literally forcing me through five years of classical piano and public concerts, which as I got older (I enjoyed it when I was a little kid then as I got older I sensed the huge pressure). At the age of ten, I purposefully botched a public concert to piss her off and get out of it. It worked. I still don't regret it.  But yesterday i found her Glare of Rage to be very off putting and funny at the same time. She went on and on about how she made a big effort to ""make sure I was cultivated"" blah blah and all this stuff but then started going off on me and pointing at me and saying, ""Dont' even think about making a living at this! Forget it!""
Nobody had mentioned this.  I was talking about a hobby. She handed me my brother's gift, (he wasn't there) who beat the **ck out of me several times.  I posed for the freaking pic with the gift, then promptly gave it to charity today. Ha!  I'd like to say that none of this affects me, but in a small way it kind of does. I'd halfway been thinking of writing songs for fun. I realize it's ""not really a job."" But WTF....",depression
severe sleep disturbance,"I don't know where other people are on their journey.  I am feeling much better emotionally, but the one last holdout is that I have major sleep disturbances.  I mean it is a real problem. I used to be on tons of medication, and now I take only seroquel, but I don't even want to take that.  But, if I don't take it, it's a real mess.  I mean I can get to sleep, but invariably I wake up after 3 or 3.5 hours.  I am off for the summer, but attending school, so it's still a huge problem.  I forced myself to get up and do my schoolwork. God I was so exhausted. Horrible. I was such a mess trying to do my work and get through the day, nearly impossible. I could not get to the gym, get chores done or get out to get groceries or other shopping. I was so exhausted. I was fine cutting the Seroquel down to .25 for a while, and now that's not working. It's such a mess that again I woke up in the middle of the night, it's usually after about three hours, and after an hour passed I took the seroquel and was able to get back to bed...but it pushed my wakeup time until 10:30 AM. Aaaargh!!!  It screws up my whole day. Melatonin does work, it helps me to get to sleep, but does keep me there. The pharmacist recommended extended release. I contacted a sleep doctor who has been trying to help me. He was trying different non addictive sleep meds but they are hugely expensive and not covered by insurance.  Both were denied.  He said not to take more than 3 MG Melatonin that it would be too much. I have 10 MG Melatonin XR here, I might try it again. It's the waking up that's really getting me-I just never go back to bed. And I know sleep/mood goes hand in hand. The doc also said to get off the cell phone.  I've found that I CAN'T SEEM TO DO THIS!  I can't put away the freaking phone. I've managed to take the actual computer out of the bedroom and put it on the desk, but I do seem addicted to the stupid cell phone. My god. Any suggestions would be helpful. I have quit on the MMJ for a lot of reasons-it was making me paranoid and I am interviewing for other jobs. Any help here would be welcome. ",depression

Struggling to cope,"I was raped years ago by a 'friend'. Passed out and woke up with him ontop of me. And now, 20/2/19, I was raped again. I had known the guy for over a year, he was a friend from work and he used to give me lifts home sometimes. He had seen and spoken to my partner before and I thought he was an alright mate. Asked if I wanted a lift that day because he had to drop something off in the area I lived anyway. It wasn't until I was in the car, seatbelt on, that he said he got a text telling him to go somewhere else first. He had done a few things like that before so I felt okay about it and thought I knew he would take me home straight after. He stopped at a shop, came back with alcohol and I felt a little uneasy then. I asked if he was done and ready to take me home. And I realised we were already heading the wrong way. We parked outside a set of flats but it was away from the main roads or any people from what I could tell. I sat in the car as he got out. He opened my door and told me to come to. I sad Id stay in the car but he wouldn't have it. I tried to leave my bag in the car so I had a reason to get out of the place asap if anything happened but he saw it and told me he didn't want his car broken into so I had to take my bag. He grabbed my arm as we got to a lift. I asked where we were, what he was doing and how long it would take. He just kept telling me to relax before he pulled his keys out and said that we were at his house.

He said that his wife and son were away for the night so it was the perfect opportunity. I didn't know what he meant. I just stood in the living room looking at him confused. He asked me if I wanted to shower. To which I said, no. I'll have one when I get home.. ""Don't be silly have a shower here"" he said. I protested again and again until he took me into the bathroom and left me there.. I stood there panicked. I didn't know what to do, what was going on. And after a few seconds, he let himself in. He kept telling to stop being silly to get in the shower, saying we'll sit down for a while after and then he would drop me home.  Eventually, I said ok. I locked the door and turned the shower on thinking I could get away with just sitting there for 5mins or so and come out. But no. He unlocked the door from the outside and got angry saying I was acting so stupid tonight and to just get in. So I asked him to go out and assured him I would shower. Closed the door and listened for a second, he walked towards where the front door was. I felt scared then. Got in the shower and closed the curtain incase he unlocked the door and looked again. He let himself in, and I froze. He moved the curtain and I tried to cover myself. He made comments about my body and slapped my bum. I told him to leave and he laughed. I got out after that and was just about to get dressed when he appeared again I questioned what the hell he was doing and asked him to leave me to get dressed but he grabbed my arm again and took me straight to a bedroom opposite the bathroom. I faught so hard against him, I told him I didn't want to, I wanted to go home. He was too heavy. He held me down and kept slapping me around the face telling me I liked it rough because I was a whore. He managed to force his fingers inside and it hurt so much! He was so rough I felt sore everywhere. When he had finished.... I asked if I could leave. No. I asked to have a cigarette because I knew I had my phone in my bag that he didn't know about and I wanted the chance to get help. He said I could and I rushed to my bag. My sister was already phoning me, I answered, quickly told her I needed help, that I had been raped and roughly what area I was in before he called and I had to hide the phone quickly. When I went on to the small balcony, I looked for ways to get help or climb down. I found nothing. He had gone into the kitchen as I looked round, so I quickly pulled out my phone. Again, it was already ringing and it was the police. I whispered to them as many details of my location as I could but they had no idea. I burnt myself with my cigarette realising I wasn't going to get help. I had a few seconds after my cigarette to attempt to escape but the only way down was a lift and he caught me and dragged me back in before it had came. He raped me again. I faught, I really tried but his hits to my face got harder until I couldn't take it and said I would let him do what he wanted if he didn't hit me anymore. After the escape attempt he wouldn't let me out of his sight. He kept forcing me to drink vodka and coke while laughing at me being ""feisty"" and saying I was ""giving him a work out"". I went to the bathroom and he stood by the door. I self harmed with his razor, I didn't know what to do. I felt disgusting. He kept calling me names for not being grateful as I sat there on the sofa, shaking, unable to take in what was happening. Grateful for what?



The third time that night, he bent me on all fours as I still faught and pleaded with him to let me go home util he managed to grab my hair. He twisted it around his wrist and held me in place. Because I wasn't ""ready"" he squirted moisturiser or something on my back and I just couldn't fight anymore.. I just tried to let my body go numb until it stopped. Eventually, after the third time, I was sitting curled up on his sofa asking and asking to leave. And he finally said I could. So I got up, grabbed my things and got out as quickly as possible. I didn't know what time it was or where I was but I walked as quickly as I could away from that place. I found a path straight away where cars couldn't go and the second I got to that path I called my sister and told her all the roads I could see and every shop until I was picked up and brought home. 

I had to leave my job because of him so I have no income. I am sleeping on my mum's sofa and my day consists of sitting there in my pjs staring into space or scrolling through Facebook without actually taking anything in. I don't know what to do anymore. With no money, I have nothing. He has ruined my life.",depression
Battling My Demons and Losing,"I don't even know what to say. I'm alone, completely alone. I am going to be 39 in a month and I am at a standstill in life. I have never really found my place. I have spent the last 20ish years being a mother to four children and a girlfriend to a man that, saw me as a means to an end. I finally ended that two years ago. His children no longer have anything to do with me and my children are teenagers. One has rebelled and is living her own way and the other is busy with teen drama and fun plans. I find that 99% of the time I am just home alone. I haven't had the courage to start another relationship since. Dating is terrifying these days. I have one friend that I see every couple of weeks but other than that no one. I was let go from my last job after three years. It was a huge surprise and still feels like I have been hit by a truck. I thought I was doing really well. It feels like I have been kicked out of the family. And to throw the cherry on top of this sundae of despair, two weeks ago my car stopped running. I knew it was on its way out but I had no idea I wouldn't have a job to replace it. 
I didn't tell you all that to get anything from it. I told you because I want... need someone, anyone to understand the demons I fight daily. The constant doubts in myself. I look in the mirror and I'm disgusted by what I see. I know I need to eat better and exercise so I start a routine. Three weeks in I can stop myself from thinking, why? Why are you trying so hard for nothing? You're not worth it. It's not going to get you anywhere. No one even knows you exist.  And there is never anyone around to hear anything different. 
So now I'm looking toward the future and I don't see anything. It's blank. When my youngest graduates, I don't know what my purpose is from there. How do I pick myself up, by myself, and find a happy life for myself? Everything I have ever wanted to do has always just been dreams. I don't have much education and from what I have been told I'm not really good at anything. I've thought about taking the last little bit of money I have, driving cross country, and starting over. Hoping I would find a companion and learn to feel comfortable socializing. The thought of doing it all alone terrifies me. How do I escape myself when there is no one else? I am my own worst bully. That horrible voice that torments me constantly.... You're not worth it. Nobody cares not even you... 
But I do care and I don't want to feel this way anymore. I need help.

in need of help,"Hi! i haven't been on here in forever but, I'm having alot of trouble with my family right now. With my dad it was my first day back from a week of soccer camp and my mom picked me up and we went to my grandmothers(we live there now because my moms house's roof is destroyed now from a tornado but we were okay) and at night my dad came and got me, we go to his house and we got into this fight and whenever i went to go an apoligize he said he was tired of my shit and to go to my moms and call her. So, i did and i told him she was going to pick me up  and he said okay and i went into my brothers room to tell him and my dad came in and told me to give him my phone and i asked him what i did and then he took it and i tried getting it back and then he got physical and kept pushing me into my room and he was scaring me and i got out of him pushing me against the wall and started to run to the front door but he caught up to me and pulled my hair so i would get away from the door and he kept hurting me and that night my dad got mad at my brother for some reason and took his phone and x box and he went outside and drove away. my mom came with my cousin and grandmother and i told them the story. It's been two weeks and he hasn't apoligized yet or even remotely cared. I asked for my phone and he said i have to visit him in order to get it. I'm at his house right now and he has been acting like nothing happened and i asked when im getting my phone back and he said this isn't even part of the disscussion right now. With my aunt she acts like she is the boss of everything that breathes around her. Today, I told her I'm spending the night with someone the next night and I can meet up with our church on time because my friend is going the same place. And she said no. I said I might and she kept explaining why I can't go and it was all about me not probably going to get up on time but everyone knows if i set an alarm I'm waking up to it and she still said no. And i said I'm sorry but you can't just say i can't go somewhere unless it's a really bad place to go. And she stil said i couldn't go. I asked my mom and she's totally fine with it. With my brother he doesn't care about what my dad did. It hurts alot and he used to atleast pretend to care but now he doesn't even do that. He said he didn't care and it hurt. With my grandmother she just never cares and I would always say I love you and she would be jokingly say dont say that or gross or ewand i would laugh but sometimes i just want to hear to back. She is so mean to me and my mom whenever were fighting. I'm starting to think there is no one in my family that cares. And sometimes I think that if i was in the hospital they wouldn't come. It just hurts whenever the person you thought was wonderful, a superhero, an amazing dad turns out to be a manipulative narssist. I really wish my brother cared enough for his sister like he cares about our older brother. I thought my aunt was good to but there afre many many different things that show she isn't the amazing christian woman she seems to be. I'm thinking about moving in with one of my friends for a lttle bit but i dont know who would let me. I just need to get out of there. Ever since my dad did that to me I've been sad every single day but around friends I'm the happiest, not with my family though. Sorry it was way longer than i wanted it to be!",depression

Just need to let it out,"So today I feel like I hit rock bottom.  I can't figure out why wrecking my bumper was the final straw. Over the last three years I have lost my husband, three brothers, mother and father.  After working hard all of my life, saving and taking care of my husband for seven years, he died of cancer.  Even with decent insurance, I was left with a quarter of a million dollars of debt. Had savings, so had to pay it, there goes saving all of my life for my senior years.  My husband had his own business and after he passed away I found out he had personally guaranteed business loans that I now owe; community property and such. Because he died before full retirement age, I do not get any of his social security, only mine (We both put in about the same and I only get one) Ok, so I have to work.  Social Security office told me if I make more than 1200.00 per month they take half of my monthly Social Security away. I can't live on what I get as it is, which is why I wanted to work. Also, I am discovering there is definately age discrimination, legal or not. When my husband died I sold our home to move into a much smaller home because I couldn't afford the payments. I have equity in my home, so bankruptcy is out of the question or they will take my home. Busines creditors are pushing me to sell my home to pay them, which will then leave me with no money for a mortgage or rent, so, today I backed into a small wall I couldnt see and THIS is when I finally fell apart. I finally just cant see an answer and keep wondering what I did wrong. I know it could be worse, I am still healthy but it is hard to get up each day to face what seems so dismal.  Any advice anyone?",depression

New To This,"Hi, I'm Bryan. Honestly not sure what to say without sounding like I'm just complaining about my life to strangers to get attention. Not that I feel that is what this is, just hate the feeling of being a burden or hinderance to others, especially those I don't even know.
I guess to make a long story short, I have a rather long medical history that is kind of rare. Growing up I was pretty ignorant to all the conditions I have, so it my childhood was somewhat normal. Just a lot of hospital visits and doctors appointments. It's what is happening now that has shown me that I'm not like everyone else. In 3 years I've been hospitalized 54 times via emergencies. Everytime I see that those that go through similar situations are double my age or more. Doctors telling me constantly that their are no fixes to my conditions and that I just have to live with being this way, and to be honest it is killing me faster than these health conditions are....
Not sure of what I can do to even help ease the strain, but I'm hoping that talking things out and being a support for anyone who are facing problems of their own can help. So, I guess I'm here if anyone needs, and hoping that maybe I can ease this heaviness on my mind and heart.",depression

Going through a breakup.....,"My ex has been in me and my daughters life for the past 5 years and now, after a lot of ups and downs and doubting whether we are right for each other we finally agreed that we shouldn’t be a couple.

I feel so stupid for even allowing it to get this far in the first place and it’s reallt depressing me that my daughter might hate me for not just sticking it out but I don’t want to force anything on anybody. The thing that really hurts is that I see how not in tune he is with my feelings and points and I know my attachment is just based off of what I’m used to. We have to continue living together for a month or so until he finds a place and I find work so it makes it even harder. I’m just sick of my relationships ending this way.

My mom told me that a few nights ago when she and my dad were staying at my place, she got up in the middle of the night to get some water and heard me say in my sleep, ""I want to be free."" And I think that to myself a lot. But what the hell does that mean specifically? What does being free entail? And how am I not free now? I own my home and my car, I have a job... and soon I'll have what looks like will be a more satisfying one. So what does that mean? Damned if I know. I am so sick of soul searching, making lists, trying to figure it out. I wish I just knew. I feel lost and rudderless and it bothers me. I wake up in the morning without any inspiration or particular motivation. I feel hollow. I do that exercise where you list everything you are grateful for-- that shit totally does not work. Because I look at my list and I still feel depressed, and then I start berating myself for feeling depressed when clearly, I have a lot to be grateful for, so what right do I have to be depressed? Shit man.",depression
Getting help,I started conciling I've only been going for two week. But it seems to help tho she's wanting to open up old wounds and work on what my father did. And I weighed myself and I'm down to 110 and I have to force myself to eat. It's hard but I'm getting there hopefully I will continue to get better and that opening these wounds (that made me stop eating and cutting at the time) won't make things worse.,depression
running out of tolerance,"There seems to be a thread in some of what I am posting, I don't know, but I had put in one of my last posts that as I change, so do my relationships.  How true. I'm getting to a point where, well I have no patience left. On a better more positive note, new people are just showing up unexpectedly, which is good. I've been accepting chances and invitations to do other things, I got invited to a party, so I went, exchanged numbers with some people and have been getting texted by people, which I think is reflective of the shift I am making, but my tolerance for my current friends is running out very quickly. Yesterday we met for a hangout and it was a good 45 minutes of her talking about her weight problems. I think it is fun for her to complain and she likes the attention. She is dangerously obese and was laughing and saying, ""I'm hungry, I like eating,"" and then went back complaining about the extra 100 pounds. I tried and tried to help her, found myself giving advice, counseling her about what she eats, she eats cake, cookies, ice cream, then after the discussion, she went for free food at the bar, stuffed her face and laughed about it. All our get togethers are talks about food, nothing else anymore. And she hates herself, hates being overweight-then turns around and laughs and then proceeds to order and ice cream or something else. She LOVES the sympathy and it's obvious. Goes to exercise and training daily then binges at night. Might have a problem. She and her relative are the same way. Lately all our discussions are on portion sizes, this, that, nothing fun.  My God. I was talking about my new school program and the ideas I was working on, something I might patent, and she jumped in and said, ""I was thinking about doing that!"" In the past, when I have done something new, different, she has tried to jump on, overshadow it, and say, ""Oh, I was going to do that."" There was this small voice in the back of my head telling me to be careful, not to talk about the ideas and the designs I was working on, for the next thing I know someone will turn around and be doing the exact same thing and...there goes what I am working on. I don't know. I can't help her any more. I don't want her to bring her problems to me anymore. She doesn't want solutions, she wants attention and sympathy and to take up my time and energy. Thankfully I'm building new connections I don't think I can handle much more of this. ",depression
survivor of childhood abuse,"is there a good group on here for a survivor of childhood physical and mental abuse.  i'm having a really hard time right now because both those things happened to me and my family swept it under the rug and continues to do so decades later. i'm just supposed to go along with all the bullshit and be a good little soldier and not make any waves.  i feel like it is doing me in and i don't really know what to do.  i want to have nothing to do with any of them and talking to them never works...  it's really hard to cut them all off right now.  and yes, i have confronted all of them but they don't listen, just tune me out...  the anger is eating me up.  i really need to get away from this sick situation but i can't.. i mean, i don't see the way.

I dont understand,"I have been feeling extremely depressed for a couple of months now. but sometimes when i find myself feeling ok it feels weird. it feels weird to feel ok. it feels weird to feel happy or clam. today i felt ok, maybe even happy. i spend time with my mom. i feel like i don't deserve to be happy or ok. it feels so weird. i guess its been so long since i felt something. felt anything. for so long i felt nothing, just empty. but today i felt a moment of happiness, and it felt strange. i don't understand myself. i don't understand why i feel like i did something wrong. feeling happy isn't a crime but i feel like it was. i feel like i don't have the right to be happy. i just don't know who i am anymore. but that moment of happiness and feeling ok is gone. now i am just back to feeling nothing. just feeling so empty. i wish i could just understand myself.
i mean i cant control it. some people think for some reason i can control it. if i could control it i wouldn't feel so empty for so many months. i wouldn't feel so depressed and suicidal its something i cant control. i cant just be happy. i tried before. i cant control feeling so depressed it hurts. when i have a moment when i feel ok or even happy it feels unnatural it feels wrong.",depression

Friend has Cancer,"I saw a friend I hadn't seen in awhile. She wasn't a close friend, but when I bartended she worked at another bar that I went to alot and talking to her always made me feel better when I was having a rough day.
She is a client where I work now and I hadn't seen her in awhile. She came in today and told us she has a rare aggressive form of breast cancer. I guess they caught it pretty early and she is doing awesome with her chemo treatments. She had just gotten her head shaved and wearing a head scarf.
She has a great personality and it's possible she can beat this. It just makes me sad that she has to go thru this. Cancer is very scary and makes me sad to think about it.

Getting off Remeron,"I'm hoping to get some advice and support. I was put on Effexor and Remeron (15 mg) in January for anxiety and depression after ending up in a mental health facility in January. Despite working out and dieting, I gained 20 pounds. I decided to come off it ( went to 7.5 mg for a few days and then went off) with the help of my psychiatrist. I couldn't sleep so I went back on it for about a week, and was prescribed Trazedone and have been off Remeron for almost a week ( sleep has been great). I was also put on Wellbutrin. 
I believe I may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms; flu like symptoms, crying more than usual, fogginess, word retrieval problems and fatigue.
My self esteem has been so bad because of the weight gain. Every time I look in the mirror I cry. I had to put a towel over my bathroom mirror. I'm extremely concerned because I've heard it can be hard to lose the weight even when taken off of the Remeron. I've also heard withdrawal symptoms can last a while. I don't want any of this to effect work; I need my brain to work! 
Does anyone have any experience with Remeron? I'm worried and frustrated ☹️",depression
So alone,"There really is no reason for me to be here. I was a mistake from the beginning. I have told family members (since I have no one else) that I want to kill myself,and the response was to ignore it,and stay away from me. My mom told me ""I'm hard to be around"". I'm out in the middle of nowhere,living with my parents,and I'm 53 years old! My sister just dumped me..because I was sad. So I'm old,friendless, not easy to be around,and my family cant help me. I have no connection to anyone,or anything. 
The only thing that makes me hesitate,is I'm afraid I'll be just as confused,and alone as I am ""living"". I'm pretty sure it will happen,as soon as I just cant take it anymore.
I am on medication,and am going to counseling. It's being here,with my family that keeps me from healing. It's a very toxic enviroment,and no one is happy. A lot of delusional thinking. It's very difficult for me to get a job right now,since I'm such a mess,and there is no place else to go. 
I've been fighting against the tide for so long,and I'm tired.

"As I change, so do my relationships","I was hoping for some feedback here in regards to this.  I have had depression and anxiety for a long time, and I've been recovering from it.  I've been practicing a lot of spiritual techniques, in addition to making major changes, going to therapy, and changing my mindset. I've noticed as I'm changing my life for the better, well some of my relationships are getting worse.  Let me explain. It's almost like they are noticing that things are better and they don't like it.  Some of them have made I think what questionable choices are. One of them got married to a guy that seemed alright...but it also seemed like a bit of a gamble.  She really wanted me to get married to their brother in law, but I sensed trouble...and now he could be the demise of their marriage.  Another friend, upon her father passing away last year, moved in with mom...I could see why she did it but it did not seem like the best idea.  Again, another questionable choice leading to near disaster. They fight like cats and dogs, the mom has my friend wrapped around her finger.  In both cases I have kept my mouth shut and my opinions to myself, but within myself I did see at least some of it coming.  I just didn't realize how badly things were going to turn out.  They appeared to be bad choices at the outset, but it's not my life.  I'm actually pretty appalled at the downturn things have taken and am worrried for them in a way. In addition, there are the health issues, both have gained a significant amount of weight, continue to complain vehemently, yet do nothing. One is actively losing the weight. The other is dangerously obese, complains to me, works out all the time, but eats a ridiculous amount of food and...results always the same.  In the past several years I course corrected, participated in my own physical and mental health recovery (And lost a lot of weight too) and am beginning to see things really diverge-like two lines on a graph. They are close together, X and Y, then vastly apart as the graph goes out. If I am X maybe at least one of them is Y. 
I am turning 47 here shortly and as you know there is natural aging. Not my favorite thing, but there it is. One of my friends comes in to my house and says, ""Oh I see you put on makeup,"" I said, ""Yeah, no big deal just lip gloss and blush.""  The tone in her voice was not good and she took on this mocking and sarcastic tone, and starting saying, ""Well, look at me, I just woke up this way.""  I didn't like it.  Later on in the day, she asked me how I felt about my birthday, said I was ""rocking aging."" I said, ""I guess I can't complain,"" Thinking that it was not really that big a deal, a neutral statement, not, ""God yeah I'm so freaking hot can you believe it?"" No, just I can't complain-because I can't!!  Why would I? There are people in my age category dying from this and that, things happening, some people, students of mine who have been killed not even twenty...I figure being grateful is the best thing you can be. Then the comments start coming in again.  Something like, ""Look at me, Look at me,"" In that snotty and disgusting tone of voice.  The rest of the day went on, everyone complaining incessantly about aging and being overweight and being tired.  I just really didn't know what to say. To be honest it was depressing.  Someone remarked that I didn't seem to be resonating with the conversation, which I wasn't.  I know people in their 60s and even older who are WAY more active, hike like mad, camp, put up entire campgrounds, and don't complain one peep. They have fun.  
I don't get it.  I've cleaned out my life of so many people there is about to be no one left. I left an abusive situation, other bad friends, now this???  It distinctly seems that this all started emerging since my depression resolved and my life got better.  Another friend really went big time on the attack, telling me how fucked up I was, being super nasty. I blocked his number. Is this what happens when you recover/go through recovery? The true character of people starts showing up? To be clear, people have always regarded/told me my whole life that i needed to be confident about myself, that arrogance was not my issue, that a sense of inferiority was the issue-even employers said this-that it was an impediment to moving forward. Hmm.

Thinking about a mood stabilizer,"I've had a traumatic brain injury which damaged the emotional regulation and lability parts of my brain. From that I have these mood swings but I prefer to call them emotional tidal waves. It comes out of nowhere and hits me so hard. I can't see what's happening until it's passed or the emotions have calmed. I don't really know what triggers it, just feels like everything hits me so much easier now. Things I would have been able to let go before are now a source of anger and irritability. I feel so drained after and have to pull myself back together every time. I feel so awful because whatever or whoever triggered me isn't doing anything wrong really. But then I don't want to say I'm at fault because I didn't do this to myself and I can't stop it when I'm in it. I wish I could. 
I'm on an antidepressant and a sedative/antidepressant as well as a dopamine agonist. My psychiatrist did warn me that mood stabilizers and antipsychotics have very big side effects. Ultimately it's up to me to weigh the risk. These tidal waves will most likely not get better. It's cost me so much. I just want to make it not such a roller coaster. I think it's gotten a little smoother this last six months but then I realize I lost one of my best friends, I've cut ties with my dad and have had so many failed dates/relationships. I was thinking that it's not that bad but isn't it? Having uncontrollable emotions and not being able to explain it or say it's going to get better, it feels hopeless. Why not try a mood stabilizer? But maybe these people weren't meant to be in my life, they can't handle it but someone else will? It breaks me knowing this is my life at 28. Friends are getting married, starting families, progressing in their careers.. And after 3.5 years I'm still recovering, still trying to find my way. I'm so happy for them and try to be gentle with myself but some days it feels so much harder.",depression
"bad night, family trouble, over eating.","i was trying to get through the day on a positive note and then i made the mistake of going into my mom's room and talking with her about family issues.  wow, what a powder keg.  i don't have the time or energy to get into the whole thing but it was bad. a bad screaming argument.  basically, she is living with me because she needs my help and has no where else to go right now and because of that she is bringing these atrocious people/my other family members into my life.  my father who physically abused me while i was growing up (she was there and did nothing), my brother and sister who are cold hearted aholes and treat me like sh8t.  my mom just won't stick up for herself.  she says that ""family's have to try to work things out""   I say, there is a point where you no longer are working things out by staying in relationships with people but you are just being abused.  that is the point i feel i am at with most of my family. 
I really want to help my mom and let her live with me because i want her to have a place to be where someone cares about her and will look after her.  it's either this or assisted living which she doesn't want.  but i don't know how much more of this crap i can take.
i feel really bad.  why is it that everyone in my life is unsupportive, awful and abusive in one way or another.  i feel like that is abnormal.  or is it?  i don't know because i don't think i have ever had a healthy relationhship with anyone except my pets.
does anyone else have this kind of problem.  i know i am not the only one but i feel like it.  it's like i don't get along with anyone.  I feel like i am going crazy.  and yea, i'm depressed too.  
i'm trying so hard  not to overeat but this shxt is pushing over the edge and then i start to stuff my face.  i desperately need to lose some weight and i've told my mom this.  please mom do not upset me too much or i can't diet.  but it always happens.  if i can't lose some weight i may actually lose my job.
arrgghh. thx for letting me vent here.

Yet another depression,"I have suffered with recurring depression all my adult life. You think I'd be used to it by now, but I'm not. I think what prevents one getting used to it is the black heart of the depression that tells you that this is the one you'll never recover from. That's exactly how I'm feeling now, even though I have the experience of finally emerging from countless episodes. This one does though have differences: I'm now seventy years old and immensely weary of the struggle. Being that age, I'm retired and have been for four years. I thought I had a strategy for dealing with retirement but I was fooling myself. I've ended up bored, purposeless and isolated, so consequently very lonely.
I'm feeling that all my chickens have come home to roost, that is, this is how one ends up after severing every relationship one has ever had, as I have. The friends I've had have never measured up, or at least that's how I've perceived them and that's because I've always looked for the faults rather than the good points. Complicating this phenomenon is that, because of my life-long low self-esteem, I've always found it difficult to believe that people really liked me, or if they did, something must have been wrong with them to be liking someone like me.
Full disclosure here: I have an underlying psychological problem. In my early twenties, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. The consequent insecurity has caused me to be crippled emotionally and has tainted every relationship I've ever had. My life-long strategy seems to have been to get rid of people before they got rid of me.
My current depression began with several weeks of mild depression which suddenly nose-dived into full-blown depression with all the attendant baggage: little appetite, trouble sleeping and extreme delicacy which has me dreading the slightest real-life problem. When I awake, usually in the early hours of the morning I'm overcome with a feeling of extreme dread. My heart rate rises and my temperature increases. Realising I'm awake seems to be the worst thing that can be happening to me.
My waking hours are filled with morbid ruminating and reviewing the myriad of ways I've gone wrong in my life, as though constant thinking about them can somehow rectify them. That is when I'm not thinking about committing suicide which, worryingly, tends to make a lot of sense. I can think of many more reasons to die than continuing to living. For example, I'm probably close to the end of my life anyway, so would it really make that much difference to shave a few years of the end, particularly so when those few years will be marked by physical and mental decline causing them to be the worst of the lot? So, I could be doing myself a big favour by making an early departure.
I'm contributing all this because by talking to people who can fully understand what I'm talking about my elicit much needed support. I would appreciate any that could be given.",depression
i can't anymore,"everything is horrible. My life is horrible. I'm just deppresed all the time and nothing is helping me. its hard to help myslef.

the only real thing i care about right now is losing weight. losing as much weight as i can. i hate being fat. i just need to keep losing and hopeful that will help with my life.

by the end of the day i am usually drugged with caffeine and choc and overeating and exhausted by work so it numbs my emotions down.  plus i know that i can go to bed soon and that's is my favorite place to be, in bed with my legs up and unconscious, usually having one nightmare after another.  but the nightmares are actually a break from what i have to go through when i am awake.  seriously.

Final thoughts...,"Why? Idk why I’m the way I am anymore. I do my best to help others feel good about themselves, help the laugh, smile, be there listening ear. Everyone always says I’m a great person for being so kind. But deep down I hate myself. I hate my face, I hate my smile, I hate my life. My head is spinning I can’t think straight anymore. It’s like my brain likes tormenting me... like it gets a kick out of watching me suffer. I want to reach out but nobody listens. I feel like an anchor, like I pull others down. I’m a distraction, a bother, a pest, an annoyance. I just want to disappear, like I never existed. Maybe then everything would be better, maybe my parents would have someone to be proud of. Maybe my friends would be happier. Nobody would even notice... I’m unlovable I realize more and more everyday. I’m not worth fighting for.

Losing everything,"I have just found out that I may have cancer. I have accepted that God may call me to His kingdom soon. I fear that I will die alone, as my family is slowly being ripped away from me.
My oldest granddaughter, who is a cruel girl who hates me for no reason other than her deceased mother poisoning her against me, took custody of her four year old little sister when their mother died and made her say such awful things about me to get a restraining order against me and my husband for both of them so I could not see them any more. Then she started poisoning my middle granddaughter, who is her teenaged cousin, and her mental health went so terribly bad and she started hurting herself, drinking and spending time with people of bad influence. Then one day she went crazy and went to the police to claim horrible things about my son and his wife, and about me too! Now child services took her away from them and gave my oldest granddaughter custody! None of my granddaughters speak to me or my husband or my son any more and it is devastating. I believe she is a terrible influence on them, she has a bad lifestyle and has told them to turn their backs on their family who loves them. But I do still love her, and my other granddaughters, and it pains me to not see them.
I have my husband, but he spends more and more time away from me. My son and daughter-in-law are busy with the legal troubles brought up by his daughter. My grandson is busy getting ready for his sweetheart to have a baby I may never meet.

Any advice?,"I'll try and make this short....



Victim of violent crime..... my abusers are teachers and doctors..... police took the side of my abusers when I finally found the strenth to report these scum bags. I get no justice, and my abusers can carry on abusing.... sadly others who get attacked/sexually abused tend to bottle it up..... they think its not worth the hassle which I understand as the police are arrogant and don't want to do their jobs properly. Even my mother got assaulted by a doctor and chose to say nothing. She said ""well I'll never go back to that doctor, its over now, can't change the past"" but what about other people who might get targeted for being attacked? Surely these abusers should be stopped! I don't get it, because it destroys peoples' well being and lives.

I've had therapy and learned lots about the minds of these predators and quite simply, they are poison, no going back once they've abused victim number 1. They have no soul, and they'll rot. 

My problem at present: my family's reaction.... my parents have yelled awful things at me that have diminished my relationship with them, when all I've done is tell them about the abuse. Okay, I bottled up two crimes for years as I was a minor when they happened and couldn't find the right words, lost confidence etc. But eventually I found the strength to speak up. My parents seemed to have attached their own feelings when listening to me, so they stop themselves from properly understanding my perspective. I've had, ""You've dis-owned us!"" and ""We are carrying the burden of all this abuse you've had"" (as if I'm carrying nothing?!!) ""You're a bag of shit"" (okay, yes, I looked awful but I'm traumatised so I won't look great will I?) ""You can't expect us to listen to you with the same credability"" (because it took years for me to find the confidence to tell them about a male doctor sexually abusing me)  ""If he abused you, then why did you go back?!"" (I was a kid and didn't want to believe this predator abused me, plus it was incredibly confusing as I was very young and went to him for help/treatment).....

I'm autistic, recently diagnosed, and clearly predators sensed I was ideal target all those years ago. 



Being autistic, my mind can't dismiss anything really. I still have all this awful stuff my parents have said swimming in my head. Do any of you have any ideas/techniques I can try that will help turn my mind away from the flashbacks of what my parents have yelled at me? It all still torments me and they should never have behaved this way towards me.... they say they can't remember.... I have short episodes where I feel angry at them..... sometimes I think it was a big mistake telling my family about all this abuse....... because what my parents have yelled at me/how they reacted has worsened my mental health..... they have abused me verbally and emotionally.....

Sick of everything.,"I'm constantly buckling and breaking from my depression and anger. Only to rebuild at the end of the day. I have Asperger's Syndrome, OCD, and severe ADHD. I had my first suicide attempt at 12 and was hospitalized twice in my life. Once at 17 and at 21 for suicidal ideation.  My life is hell. I'm lonely all day and have no social support system. I spend all day wanting to die. Or even kill others. My stepfather has nothing but contempt from me. He is abusive and I absolutely hate him. Every time I look at him I just feel an absolute urge to murder him for revenge on every time he's abused and bullied me. 
Mental health treatment has had very little effect in my life. Five therapists, four psychiatrists, two social workers, ten medications and two hospital stays have done pretty much nothing.

A group of kids told my whole school that I am going to be just like my family. I hae no friends and you wonder why. Every friend I make, some body tells aout my history. Every body at school tells me to kill my self. I am thinking about doing it. I am sick of being made fun of by kids, friends, strangers, teacher, yeah teachers. My teacher looked up all of our last names in class. The next day, every body talks aout me and the teachers give me looks like I am a danger. The one teacher said I was a good kid, the rest told her about my fmaily and I get looks. The one teacher knew my cousin who is on jail now. He said, is tyler? The class said, he is in jail and Nick is going to be just like him. My dad has never been in my life and is doing every thing with my brother, brother, sister, sister, sister. I have 5 other siblings and he is in each of their lives. I am the reason my parents are divorced. I was 4, in a bed with a lady riding my dad nude, having 20 cats in a trailer. I remeber the day before tht we were going to get pizza. WhenI was 7, My stepmom slammedmy heaf on a bathroom wall. Locked me in a bathroom for 4 hours because I didn't want to go in the water. I just made a best friend and just today he said to me, My mom thinks you are a bad influenceon me. Why? Because of my family history. PLs help me by telling stories and wht to do. I want to end all this pain.",depression
Loss and grieving,"I recently lost my best friend of nine years. I’ve struggled with depression and perpetual sadness for most of my life, but this really did it. I’ve called off of work and have absolutely no motivation to get out of my bed. I haven’t stopped crying and I don’t think I can. She was my other half, my joy, my absolute best friend on this shitty earth. I don’t know how to go through life without her and not have her by my side. I don’t think I can. ",depression
I am back,"I am a fellow Facebook fan. But I'm considering getting rid of it. I make really good friends but then I do or say something that they don't like. 
I have a friend. She got mad and blocked me. Well me being not smart I got into a argument with her on my phone. 
An argument unfortunately I started. It Was stupid. We were both using stuff we said against each other. I should have let it be. 
By the end of it she had told me at least 3 times to kill myself. Something I would never say to her. But I wasn't perfect. 
By the end of it we had fought it out and apologized. I did ok last night. This morning I was not doing well. I have schizophrenia. So my voices have been on overdrive. 
I am not mad at her it was all said in the heat of the moment. I hold no malice. I know she doesn't either. I had struck a cord I didn't know I had.

I Apologize,"Hello,
I am not very good when responding to a firm hand (on my last post). But I do understand now that I have to either be very specific or vague. I need to not put all my thoughts down and better filter myself. You all dont know my life and situation and I need to remember that when trying to confide in you. 
So, for the last week I've become very down...I dont want to be disrespectful and call it deep depression...but it certainly feels like it. There are many things that I need to do, or would like to get done, yet I dont have the drive to do them. Today I dont even want to watch TV, which is highly unusual for me.
I have done some of the chores I needed to...but I cant seem to finish them. I'm going to be moving in a month and a half, but I'll be moving closer to my family (I love and miss them a lot). Spring term is comming to an end, finals are next week. Work has a lot of drama, with aa few departments shutting down, though none of it has to do with me yet. My hot water heater and stove/oven dont work (something wrong with the propane) but I've tried all the troubleshooting I could find and the tanks are full...so I need to hire someone to come out and fix it. I go to the gym at least every other night, yet I feel like I'm getting chubbier. I have been getting spotty sleep, and makes my eyes hurt. These are all possible contributions to my mood, that's why I mention it.
I liked it last weekend when i reorganized some of my house and made it easier to find stuff...and while theres still more to organize...i cant find the will to do it.
Please, I'm not good with a firm handed response, if you have something helpful to comment, I will listen. If you dont have something helpful, then please just ignore me.
Thank you.",depression
I'm done.,"Forgive me if I'm wrong, but it looks like this is your ""adult"" way of saying ""you don't even deserve an explanation"" of why you're not talking to me. Forgive me if I'm overreacting, but I told you ahead of time I'm dramatic and honestly I've had this done to me so many times I can't take it anymore. It's really funny how after a guy meets me, he disappears. And you know when that happens so many times, I have evidence to suggest I'm clearly unwanted. I don't know why. But the part that sickens me the most is the fact that you put up this show pretending to be one of the ""good"" guys. You even went to lengths to call me on the phone everyday to heighten your act even further. I went to lengths to even CONSIDER what it would be like if I chose you. Because of the act you put up, you went to lengths to make me believe there were real men out there...you made time for me even with a child, but stupid me believed that that meant you actually wanted to pursue me. You called me when no one else would, stupid me believed that you actually wanted me in your life. You met me, stupid me thought your actions matched your words...but apparently not. After meeting me I guess you completely changed your mind. Was it because I didn't get in bed? Was the whole act just to sleep with me? And then when you didn't get what you wanted, I was disposable. And the saddest part is I'm sure if you did get what you wanted, I would still be disposable. Why? Why? Why? WHY????? What is WRONG with me? Not even my job wanted me, what makes me believe anyone else would???? Why would I believe someone like you could ever want me? I have to accept...I absolutely have to accept...that I am going to live and die in this life, ALONE. ",depression
Time,"I feel like everything is going by so fast, and I'm not handling it well. I'm 33 years old-- it only seems like yesterday that I was 17 years old and living abroad, or in college, and it seriously seems like the blink of an eye since I moved out here. I don't know if it's because I'm depressed right now about my current situation that I'm feeling so nostalgic, or what exactly. Logically, I realize that a) things weren't perfect in the good ol' days either, and that b) I still have my life ahead of me and that it can be great if I choose. I still have a lot to look forward to. I'm shadowing at a veterinary hospital as part of the interview process, to see if I really like it. I'm a bit nervous-- it sounds like an amazing opportunity, but I worry that it won't work out. Also, they sometimes take care of birds, and I'm kind of nervous around birds (ironic, since I have one tattooed on my upper arm lol). I just know that these days, I wake up feeling like I'm going absolutely nowhere in life. Time is precious. I don't want to waste another second of it doing something I seriously hate. I just needed to vent about it.",depression
Social Anxiety and Depression.,Hey I was just wondering if there any others who through social phobia as I do. Such as being so scared to leave the house to go for a walk or go into a store worrying about if others are watching them.   I mostly just help my parents and sisters when they need it and play video games or watch documentaries for entertainment.   But as of lately I've just been sleeping in or reading depression forums to see if I find any advice.,depression
CW: Update/More Info on  Dutch Assisted Suicide,"I found this update regarding the Dutch Assisted Suicide that Wandering Vet had posted about a few days ago. Apparently, there has been some misreporting. The girl applied to be euthanized but was denied by the Dutch gov't.  According to this article, she was devastated by the denial and chose to stop eating and drinking. She died at home in the presence of her parents. 
It sounds like, though it is not expressly stated, that her parents supported her choice?
I'm not sure that any of this makes the situation better, but thought I would post the article since the Dutch gov't seems to have not approved the assisted suicide.

Good bye,"I don't know how much more I can take. As soon as I get happy I see something or hear something that drags me down again. I have made a plan, I know exactly how I'd do it. Just take some pills and it would all end, the consistent tiredness, the crying, the numb feeling, and I'm sure my boss would even notice if I was gone. Since he is ignoring me, and now the teens r doing the same thing. Maybe if I died my work would go back to the way it use to be. I tend to destroy everything I touch so maybe it would be best.

Mental health awareness month. What a joke.  My employer sent out an email about how important it is to seek help and utilize the resources provided. Five visits to EAP for any one condition.

No one is alone,I know lots of us feel that there is no one out there and that people only want to hurt us and don't understand what we are going through. What we must not forget is that there are more outlets than just the people physically around us. The purpose of groups like this is so that many of us have like minded people we can rely on. It might not always work out but it doesn't hurt to try to make connections. Never be afraid to try. You only lose and suffer alone when you stop trying. ,depression
Depressed over surgery,"Hello everyone, 
To make a long story short.. I have struggled with obesity my whole life. It in itself has caused depression and anxiety.  My dad and his sister both had surgery 10 years ago and had success. I myself had always thought about it but was scared to get put to sleep and I wanted to try other methods. Fast forward to now, married with a young daughter living by the beach literally 15 minutes away and I am super depressed. I feel like it is hopeless to lose weight. I have tried everything under the sun. I just want to give up on weightloss. This is especially true since I found out my insurance company doesn't cover bariatric surgery.  I went to the beach today and just felt miserable physically and mentally. Sad because I don't have the energy to play with my daughter. Pissed at myself and angry that I can't  afford self pay $20,000 for the surgery. I just hate feeling this way. ",depression
I'm losing it,"so, I had this random 'episode' of depression tonight. And as usual, my mind went to stuff like ripping my own skin apart... And purposely breaking my own fingers and bones... And I don't want to.. and it scares me that my mind goes there... I mean.. I'm a cutter. But the group home I'm at doesn't allow anything that could be used for self harm.. and cutting for me was a way of release. To calm down. And now that I haven'tt cut, I think I'm losing it because of all these pent up emotions.. and on top of that, there's stuff that I wanna talk to people one on one about. I don't feel comfortable just putting the other stuff out there quite yet..",depression
I ghosted my friends,"Yes, the title is right.  I know it's pretty cold.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  In short, my ""friend's"" husband was hell-bent on having an affair with me.  The phone would not stop ringing and the texts would not stop coming through and I could not cope anymore, so I ended up blocking his number. It's good to be honest, I think, in life, but I really think there are times it's best to cut the cord and just save yourself when it becomes clear that other people are using you and deceiving you.  I don't like admitting it, but it's the truth.  A huge weight is off my shoulders. Oddly, I feel no sense of loneliness, the panic is gone.  He will not call from their mutual number, which I do not have blocked. This is the one that they used to use all of the time.  He gave me this ""separate"" number for some odd reason *duh*. You would have thought I would have figured this one out a long time ago-but no-I kept thinking these people actually *cared* about me. There is something liberating about seeing a wolf for what it is.  I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when he started shouting at me and cursing at me, a real mistake if there ever was one.  Stupid SOB. I despise people. ",depression

Cyber-bullying,"So basically last night, two kids from my school decided to text a giant group chat of band people about how I didn't deserve the part I had in a song. When one of my friends stood up for me, she was shut down. They made several racist, white supremacy, and gang remarks, and tried to get her suspended for standing up for me. These two kids were punished for this when the principal found out, but it's still really stressing me out with everything else going on, and I'm stuck in the middle. I want to say something, but I also don't know if I should respond. It's a really big issue, and as things do, way too many people (in my opinion) now know about it.
It made me really upset that they were targetting my friend and I. I read the conversation after it happened, because I was not on when it had happened. However, after reading it, I felt really terrible, and it also makes me even more excited for summer.",depression
Difficulty managing mood,"I don't know how to handle these emotions. Just found out a close friend has been diverting all my texts to her friends and who knows who else.

It took me a year to build up trust and then I started texting and let her come to my Facebook page.  Someone in my large community where I live, shared something with me that aroused suspicion why she would say such a thing to me and how would she know. Now, I have come to believe all my intimate details have been shared throughout this 180 bedroom senior community, no wonder people avoid me. One neighbor who is avoiding me told me it was time to move to a place where people like me need to be. When I asked her to clarify her thoughts, she walked away shaking her head.  I called the Apple Store and they told me to disable ""AirDrop"" and certain ""Notifications"" to prevent anyone from accessing my contacts and having the ability to do what this woman do to me. I also called a local hotline tonight to set up a friendly caller daily to help keep an eye on me. There are alot of other major developments in my life. I don't have a psych doc, he retired, so I am looking. I am not in therapy because I cannot afford this. Going thru a bankruptcy and the paralegal who worked on my case quit and left with my file exposing me to identity theft. My psych doc who retired of 30 years copied me on a letter he sent to a psych doc that I decided not to keep, it was cold and I felt betrayed by him. And lastly my cat is very ill. So, alot of people have hurt me that I was very close to and having trouble coping with all this. I have increased my medication in the hopes I can sleep better but my situation is defeating the effects of all this. Debbie

I've thought of getting pills but my parents only have vitamins and they don't really keep a lot of american med around...Our family struggles a lot with fiancial difficulties and so I'm not really open to a lot of resources. I struggle with a lot of things, and low self esteem is one of them. I am from an asian houshold and are the only family that lives in the US. I feel like I'm not skinny enough, not smart enough, and not talented enough to be called asian. I feel like the friends and relatives back in asia would definitely laugh at me, especially since I moved to the US, which was seen as an opportunity to improve myself, but I only became worse. Sometimes my parents make fun of my weight as a joke and I just laugh it off. They don't really pressure me to be smart, but the pressure I put on myself is much more severe. I tried to cut my self but the knife I had was too dull and I didn't really bleed. Because of that, I felt like I was too scared to do anything severe and that I'm tricking myself that I actually have depression, and that I don't understand what it really feels like to be depessed. Once me and my friend was joking about how I hate life, and words like ""Well why don't you go die?"" slipped out of her mouth. I was kind of shocked.

I know I've made progress and I'm no where near as bad as I have been but I'm just exhausted of having to do it all on my own. Everyone else gets a break or to forget about it. I'm the one stuck, reminded constantly about my chronic pain, and how it's effected every part of my life. They say 'so strong' but it's almost like they brush over everything it's costed me. It's cost me relationships, friendships, my body and mind, my career, so fucking much. I know they want me to focus on the positive and to keep going but it's really fucking hard when I look around and no one is here. I have a stack of names of people I no longer talk to because of everything. I've had to cut ties with my own father because of the cruelty he was inflicting on me. He doesn't accept mental illness and has never been supportive of my physical injuries/disabilities. But to my siblings he says it's all my fault, I'm the one ""excluding him"". I just don't know how much I can take. It feels like no matter what I do it's not enough. I've gotten better, I know I have. But it doesn't do anythng against this semi truck of sadness I'm hit with. It feels like it comes out of nowhere sometimes. Like such a small insignificant thing can trigger it and it just devastates me. I can't do anything but wait it out and feel all the pain and misery with it.

Epiphany,"I had an epiphany about myself this morning. My parents were alcoholics and my dad was bi-polar. I have an older brother, whom my parents worshipped. Everybody always seemed horrified by the fact that I existed at all. I was such a disappointment (maybe because I'm a girl;) how could I possibly be their child? My brother reveled in this. Anyway, today, I'm obese, my apartment is a disaster area, my finances are in chaos and I'm very lonely. And I realized this morning: this is all because I'm set on Self Destruct mode, and its playing out. And I'm glad I saw it, because knowledge is power. I'm sharing this in hopes it will help somebody else.",depression
Last Call,"I got off work early at 2 today. A ex reached out to me. I would t call him exactly an ex but weve spent passionate time together.  Weve never quite been able to get together.  Something about him keeps me from going there.  He has a temper but his temper is the passionate side I love about him.  We are combustible when together.   I made the practical decision and moved in with someone ive been off and on with for over a year.  He is older than me and the relationship is not a hot passionate one.  Hes a sweet man the loves me but he has erectile dysfunction and this causes us not to be physical.  Everytime ive made the decision to pursue passion, it has gotten me nothing but heartbreak as I put my whole soul into someone i truly love.  This other passionate ex of mine, i find myself thinking of him everyday, wearing the bracelet he made for me.  But, here I have made a commitment for a year with the responsible, practical man.  Im in a pickle.  I love both but i can only be passionate about one.  The ex texted me today after i hadnt heard from him in weeks.  Saying hes pissed and doesnt understand why im treating him this way.  I cant explain it...i just dont think hes in it for the long haul and hes never told me what i wanted to hear.  
I dont know what to do...my practical side conflicts with my trainwreck passionate one.....I named this journal LAst Call because im sitting at the bar where he and I met for the first time.  We met when accidently texted the wrong number (my number).  Weve been thick ever sense.  ",depression
Same path all over again,"I'm probably going to have to switch therapists again.  I've gone through two already, the first one was just an intern and didn't know what agency she was going to after she finished her internship. I loved her and she was very professional and kind. She was able to keep up with a set schedule. I just recently started seeing my current therapist after 6 weeks because she told me at the last minute she'd be out of the country. Now I'm being thrown in through the same loop all over again. I asked her what openings she had and I haven't heard a word from her it's been three days. It's so frustrating.  I've been patient I've asked if we could get a set schedule and it's been excuse after excuse. Anyone been in this situation before?",depression
Newbie and HELP,"Hi,
I obviously just joined this group.  But I am so depressed.  I can feel it in every move I make and don't make.  It's been an on and off thing for quite a while.  but I am back to the mood I actually hate living.  I actually asked someone in my class today if they would push me off the roof of our school.  I know I should talk to my mom or a professional but I just can't.  And I hate feeling this way.  I feel so down in the dumps.  People at my school say words that are hurtful and when it won't stop it breaks me.  I have been on and off wanting to cry so badly today.  And the one class and the one teacher I have longed to see today is the one I didn't have.  And even still I usually see him roaming the halls and say hi, but today was so different.  I know he was here but I haven't seen him all day.  I just don't really know what to say or do anymore.  I am feeling so hopeless.  ",depression

Worthless Piece of Shit,"That is how I feel staffing agencies view me. I have been cancelled on twice for interviews with them, they say they will help me and when I follow up with them, they say they haven't found anything yet (sounds like they haven't tried). I was scheduled for a phone interview with one today at 11am. It's currently 11:21, and I haven't heard anything. When I sent a polite email asking if we are still on for this morning's interview, I got a short response: ""Sure, that works."" Fucking Californian. Waste my time, why don't you. Treat me like I'm nothing, because that is how you make me feel. I realize I've job hopped considerably.

Bad Week,"I’ve been having a really bad week. I’ve basically been in bed everyday, not sleeping, eating too much at irregular times, not brushing my teeth or showering enough, etc. And I feel like a failure of a human being. I can tell people are tired of me. Tired of me canceling plans and making empty promises. For not trying hard enough. 
When I try to be vulnerable with people it just comes back to bite me because I can’t tell them how I’m really feeling, that when they see me just being lazy, my mind is at war with trying to stay living. I see a therapist once a week, but she couldn’t fit me in this week. I also see a psychiatric nurse practitioner like once a month, but no medicine seems to be working. 
There was one medicine that was working, but it really messed with my mind because I’m recovering from an eating disorder and the side effects enable my disordered thoughts if that makes sense? My mom is upset that I want to stop taking the medicine, so that makes me second guess myself. 
I’m so tired of disappointing everybody. Of being lonely yet wanting everyone to leave me alone. I guess I just don’t know what to do from here. My therapist knows I’ve had suicidal thoughts, but I’ve been lying to her lately and saying I haven’t had them much anymore. I feel like I can’t even take care of myself anymore. My health is all over the place. I’ve ruined my body bc of years of disordered eating, my mind runs a million miles a minute, yet I feel paralyzed. ",depression
No More,"Yesterday at work was an unmitigated shit show. Usually there is someone there from 8-5 and another person there from 1-10, so there is overlap. I worked the 1-10 shift, but there was only someone working from 8-1, as the 8-5 person was on PTO yesterday. So it was just me for 9 hours all alone, doing the work of 5 people. The phones would not stop ringing and we were slammed with others. I was constantly being nagged at and pressured by a pharmacist who does not understand how our system works. I had a STAT that was murder to deal with because the backstory behind it was a huge mess. We ultimately had to eat the cost of the meds. When I stumbled into the back to give it to the graveyard technician to fill, she gave me a bad time, verbally abused me and called me a bitch. That was it. You need to know that, regardless of what I say on here, I am very amicable and contained at work. Not last night. We literally got in a shouting match that ended with me yelling, ""YOU FUCKING BITCH!"" at her and storming out sobbing. I refuse to do this anymore. I will not be treated like that and I will not let this job fuck with my health, my happines, my sanity and my life any longer. I have no friends because I never have the energy to hang out with anyone on my day(s) off. I feel like throwing up when I walk in the door there. I have to take a prescription med to deal with my anxiety there. That is absolutely absurd. It is absurd that I put myself through this. I call my mom, my best friend, and my therapist on an almost daily basis because I am in tears before work. This can't go on. I will not let it go on. Otherwise, it may just kill me.",depression

One of those days...,"My depression is really dragging me down today, of all days. I have to say, it is the worst I've felt for quite some time now. I am not diagnosed for depression but honestly, I don't need a doctor to tell me I'm depressed. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and no one in my family who can relate to this feeling. My husband asked me what's wrong and what is it that makes me depressed. I don't know, and I couldn't tell him, other than the fact it's a whole bunch of things accumulated overtime (being jobless, money problem, family problem etc). I just feel so tired at the moment and I want to just sleep the day away. I know this isn't healthy, and my husband depends on me to keep him moving. He works the night shift, so every day, I prepare his meals, medicine and everything he needs. When he's at work, I have no one can talk to and even when he's home, he's too tired. I tried to tell my mum and my best friend about this feeling, and I don't think they can relate to me because their advice so far was to tell me to just shake off the feeling and focus on other things.
Some of you here responded to my previous issue regarding my anxiety over a job I was applying. Well, I got news yesterday that I didn't make it. Again, this dragged me down further. I wanted to prove to myself and everyone that I am worth something and that I can be independent. At my state right now, I'm not so good with rejection. My husband tried and failed to make me feel better by saying ""Well, I see it as a good thing, because your presence keeps me going and you're helping me every day to get ready for my work (meaning if I work, I can't cook for him or get things ready for him)"". He depends on me heavily to do everything for him in the background because he is the type of person who can focus on just one thing at a time. I don't mind doing the things I am doing for him now, in fact, I've been nothing but supportive to everything he's been doing. But I feel as though my life and my purpose is to serve him. What about me? When someone ask me a question like, What do you see yourself doing in 10yrs time? What do you want in life?... I seriously don't know. I thought about it a lot, but I just don't know",depression

Brothers episodes. A vent.,"My brother had a psychotic break last week. For a few days i noticed him acting strangely and we had to take him to the hospital. He would say irrational things, acted strangely and believed music talked to him. He was in the emergency room for almost 2 days and the psych ward for a few days. He just got out friday and its so scary to be around him. My mom is devastated and everyone is concerned. My room doesnt really have a lock so im constantly on edge. I sleep well and deeply but wakeup feeling exhausted. Im mopy all the time. My brother is better but he thinks hes Moses now. He believes it so strongly i find myself second guessing who the heck I am. 
Hes taking antipsychotic pills and wasnt diagnosed with anything. Doctors think its a drug related issue and it could go away even though his blood tests were negative. Its only been a few days since he got out and i feel like im absolutely suffocating. I hear my mother crying in the shower and when shes ready to sleep. I try not to cry at work but otherwise cry almost all the time. I loathe going home and I want to stay out all the time, except I feel awful to leave my mom home watching him on her own. But i also dont think i can shoulder all of this stress. I have 2 jobs and start school again soon. I have a final exam i didnt do because i had to take my brother to the hospital. Everything is spiraling out of control.
Tonight he burst into my room looking for his wallet. He thinks his money is infinite so i have hidden it from him. He was looking through all my things and yelling getting visibly more irritated. Then he tells me hes Moses and hes the reason i get sleepy. He says he doesnt need to sleep. We threaten to call the police- and he says hes not scared of the police.
He was getting so angry i really thought we should. To add insult to injury, i heard my mom making an appointment for a scan or somesort because she has a breast lump.
Were supposed to take him to an apt for a mental health plan thing on thursday. I hope they hold on to him for the whole month. And i feel awful to even think that.

Crying,"I’ve been feeling extremely depressed today.  My fiancé died when I was only 25 years old.  2 years later I meet another man who I fell in love and had a baby with.  I broke things off with him bc he was an alcoholic, emotionally abusing me & treating me bad.  I was alone for 4 years.  Back and forth from therapy, I nearly died bc I was exposed to black toxic mold...
After recovering for 2 years I met a guy on tinder.  He was a Dr. and seemed very nice.  I didn’t want to go out with him but he convinced me and I thought it would be healthy for me to get out and meet someone new.  The first date was amazing.  He was respectful and it felt so nice to have someone who liked me.  On our second date, we were kissing and one thing led to another (I know it was too soon but it had been 4 years for me) I knew I wanted to be with him but I remember losing consciousness and having moments where I could not remember what happened.  I even felt at one moment that my spirit was not inside of my body!  I woke up with a very big headache and he said I feel asleep.  I do remember wanting and consenting to sex.  I do remember moments of it.  But I don’t know why I lost consciousness.  I spoke to a psychic bc I just couldn’t understand and she said he drugged me.  He denied everything and didn’t ever want to talk to me again.
Whats worse is that I seem to have fallen in love with him!  I send him several texts, saying that I miss him and he never responds.  I know he gets it bc he yells at me every now & then and he calls me names.  Can anyone give me some advice please?  I’m a mess and severely depressed.  I made threats to him that I was going to hurt myself.  I even sent him pictures of a girl hurting herself.  I feel really bad what has happened.  He selpt with me once and now he is gone.  I had broken things off with him after the first time bc I knew something was weird but then I called him a few months after wanting to be with him again.  I feel really screwed up in my head and I can’t think straight.  Can anyone give me some advice?",depression

just some realizations,"Sometimes I think we get depressed, someone mentioned this once, when things are not the way that we expected them to be. I thought that was a really great definition. I will extend that a bit further to ""when we found out people did not regard us the way we thought.""
Sometimes relationships end, and that's OK.  I didn't used to be able to accept or deal with that.  I used to rail against that and it would really piss me off, but you know what...I see it now more as natural. One of the things that I have done over time (I used to have NO relationships at all in my earlier days as I was SO depressing to be around. I learned not to just burden others all the time and complain, and that's a good thing.  
I've now made an effort to bring something to the party, so to speak. There comes a point though, when people have to give back to you, too.  I will illustrate what I mean.  I have close friends and then more ""party"" friends.  With the party friends, mostly opposite sex, I'd been hanging out with them for about three years. One of them in particular I knew fairly well, we hung out did things, parties, bars, movies, etc.  I did a concert event last year, everyone enjoyed it. I was adding, not taking away. And unfortunately depression has the tendency to subtract from energy and situations.
I'm in the middle of a lot of transition and stress right now with work, plus health problems, it's pretty bad. Aside from my close friends, no one knows. My friend texted me late the other night and asked me if I would do another concert event-on my way to bed. Overwhelmed and exhausted, I let the text go for four days.  I replied nicely, ""hey, I have a lot going on right now, can I get back to you about this?""  He replies back ""sure, hang in there!"" And a thumbs up. In the three years we have hung out, I don't think I've ever once that I can think of really confided in him about anything. He has no real knowledge of me, my life, my background, the extent or depth of anything. We hang, it's casual, we have a good time, that's all it has been.
I would hope though, that if I know someone for a length of time, (a few years) I could reveal a little more of my true self, not just my fun and relaxed side. I texted him and asked him as a friend if there was something he could help me out with.  We work in the same field. It's wasn't even that heavy.  I just asked him since we are both teachers, did he know is a principal required to be in the school building as mine seemed to have abandoned the school building and we have violent students on campus. He should know what I'm talking about..he works in the field. No reply. Nothing.
I was pretty upset.  Angry in fact as it seems to me that for the past three years he's all ears and all in as long as everything is honkey-dorey, if I look hot or cute, if I'm the right weight, good enough to be complimented, have something fun to do, am up for a drink, flirt or movie, but one simple favor like, ""can you find the answer to this question?"" and...nothing.
I was going to plan to have a sit-down with him, I was deliberating for like the past year...to be a friend and be honest, as to why no one comes to our get togethers anymore, as he was wondering. The parties were pretty epic, scores of ppl. would pack the house, we had a blast...now no one comes and I don't either.  I just didn't have the heart to tell him why.  I've tried to date like four of his friends, they've all broke my heart and smashed it to pieces.  I didn't have the heart to lay this on him. They are, after all, his friends.  But he did want to know why no one comes around anymore. I was going to try to be an honest and real friend and let him know some of my own reasons as well as my own, that it's been sad, that it's been disappointing, that ppl have been fighting, and that...well...one of his friends has been practically stalking me...and another has dumped me.  The rest of them are all fighting with one another. And while i'd love to host another event and I miss you all and love you all terribly, I don't know if it's workable anymore. I don't want to say goodbye and I want to work this out with you, at least you my friend, but you've now ignored my simple request on a work question.
I'm afraid an honest sit down will be fruitless, and that you will be uninterested. It's no wonder none of these men can keep girlfriends and that their lives have stagnated. I'm so sad, I'm so sorry, but there's nothing more I can do. I will have to close this chapter even without a goodbye even or an honest word. I hate to just disappear, that's not how I like to roll, but I think I've been left with no other option. I feel I've been stonewalled by someone who doesn't truly give a rat's ass about my existence. Neither do any of them, or any that I've tried to date. It's sickeneing. And to think we were friends?",depression
My Day Off,"Today I woke up, went to the local Target to pick up a few things, hung out and danced around on my deck during a thunderstorm (love those), and spent a lot of time drawing. Now I'm chilling and watching ""Young Frankenstein"" (pure cult comedy genius). I'm trying to reconcile myself to the fact that I have to go into work tomorrow. To deal with bitchy coworkers and bitchy nurses in a boring desk job that is sucking the life out of me. I'm trying to keep in mind that I like the fact that I'm helping people by ensuring they get their meds. I'm trying to keep in mind that they appreciate me, in their fashion. I'm trying to keep in mind that this isn't permanent. I found this site that's a collection of courses online called Skillshare, and I've already saved a bunch of classes on making various types of art, entrepreneurship, business analytics, and graphic design. I'm meeting up with an art entrepreneur on Tuesday to learn more about what it takes to own your own business. I fully realize that with art, it will have to be functional or serve some additional purpose, in order for people to pay for it. But every list I make regarding the career I want has entrepreneurship and craft work sublisted. I set up an Instagram account for posting some of my art, but I haven't done it yet. Part of me is worried that it's not good enough, and part of me feels like art is such a personal, private thing to me that I'm posting my soul online. I'm trying to work through both feelings. Although I realize logically that I have to stay in my current job for a bit longer, life is too short. I'm not going to retire from the same desk I sit at now. Fuck that. This is not the end result. I've asked for PTO in June so that I can go up into the mountains for a bit after my parents visit. Hopefully I get it. It'll be a lot easier coming into work when I have PTO to look forward to. I'm working with several staffing companies, and I have little hope that any of them are going to find something better. The last one I interviewed with didn't even look at my entire resume. ""So you have one year of pharmacy experience?"" They asked me. Um, no. More like four. Really impressive. Whatever. I'm in this job for now, but this is not how it's going to be forever.  ",depression
Update,"Hello,
It's been a while since I've posted. I am doing okay. There's a lot of stress in my life. My fiancee is getting sued over a scrape on a car. College is demanding, I applied for a job in my field of study but came up in second place, work has me going here there and everywhere. I know what I need to do to fix a lot of it, but it is so hard to motivate myself to actually get up and do anything. All I want is to lay on the couch watching shows and movies all day with my fiancee. Chill with my fur children. That's probably my vision of happiness. Anyways, I am working on it and it's been a week since my last major episode.",depression

"""I Couldn't Care Less.""","Those literally were the words that came out of my mouth about an hour ago when a co-worker was complaining to me about some of the facilities we service. I didn't even have time to think before I said it. And everyone in the back heard it. At lunch, a co-worker asked me how my new job is going. I said, ""It's going."" ""Yeah, but where's it going? To hell...?"" She asked. I could tell she was only half joking. I said it was fine and then she left me alone. Christ, WHY IS EVERYONE RIDING ME? All anyone there asks me is how my job is going. AS IF THEY DON'T KNOW. And they do because there's no way to not see how upset I am here. Stop asking me how the fuck I am. You all know I'm miserable. I cried in the bathroom today. I slammed on the keyboard. My boss apparently told a co-worker I'm doing a good job. Of course, she didn't tell me directly. I'm working with three different staffing agencies to find a new job.

Am I Depressed?,"This past year feels like it has been a struggle .. and yet I never saw myself as someone who was suffering with depression .. yet all the signs are there. I've piled on so much weight that I can barely look in the mirror these days, I try so hard to get my life in order,
I was recently offered a fabulous job but I had to decline the offer because I really didn't feel that I could mentally do it! Half of me wanted to jump in and give it my best shot but the underlying anxiety got the better of me and I couldn't face it. After passing up this golden opportunity ..I had a mixture of feelings - relief, failure, regret 
I feel like I'm isolating myself but if I'm honest, I'm most happy when I'm by myself, Some days I don't bother to get dressed, or even shower or clean my teeth, I spend the day pottering around my garden and avoiding any contact with other people.

Update for 2019,"I finally found myself a counselor/therapist! The only question remaining is: do I still have motivation left to stay alive and get better? The only motivation I found was my favorite artist's upcoming film that I wouldn't want to miss. I attempted suicide twice in a week by suffocation, but evidently failed, as I'm still here. The therapist insisted on calling a hotline to examine me, but the hotline refused because he is a therapist. He told my mom to send me to the hospital to get an examination at the E.R., but my mom refused. She didn't directly say ""no"", but rather just said ""okay"". She thought it wasn't that big of a deal and that going to the hospital would be too much, and because I didn't want to. I'm reluctant to stay on this cruel world, and might end up doing it again for good. I'm just not sure if I really want to.",depression

Im one of those people who never forgets things. so of course, I will always show up on time if we made plans together. I just feel so hurt that people just forget about me and just makeup stuff. If you really wanted to hang out with me, then you would remember. My friend forgot about me. We were supposed to hang out and go to this school activity but I think she might of went without me. I know this because I have her on snap chat and saw her picture. Why do people do this to others? I don't do this to people. if we made plans then I would always be there. The only time I wouldn't be there is if I were sick. I feel so empty and used and just stupid. 
I have so much on my mind. Another thing is I give up. I'm done trying. Right now let me fall. Let me fall so deep down that someday I will see how much I need help. But right now let me fall. I have an eating disorder. that's what I'm talking about. Sometimes I think about getting help but I feel embarrassed because I feel like I'm too fat to get help. People won't take me seriously because I look too fat, so right now in this month of May, I just need people to let me fall deeper. Let me lose more weight. Then I will get help.

Daily Struggle,"I feel like each day is a fight. Like I barely make it through each day and then it’s on to the next one. Living life is so much more difficult when in the back of your mind, all you think about is wanting to stop living. It just hit me the other day that not everyone thinks like this. That this isn’t normal. When “normal” people go to sleep, they probably think about what they’re going to do tomorrow or plans for the weekend or something. When I’m lying awake in bed, all I can think about is how surprised I am that I actually made it through the day and how I don’t know if I can do it all again tomorrow. I’ve been told that life has its ups and downs. That one day I’ll look back on this time and I’ll see how glad I am that I did the work and pushed through. But I’ve waited on that one day for too long. I’ve just gotten more sad. It hurts me that when others look at me, they probably see laziness or “untapped potential.” I’ve had people tell me that happiness is a choice. It hurts me because I AM trying, constantly. Every breath I take is me trying. Sadly, it’s as simple as that. I am just in so much pain - mentally, emotionally. And I want the pain to stop.  ",depression
New to this,Hello! I am Katrina and I need to start on this somewhere! Any suggestions on what to do?!,depression
Old bad memories seem to always make a comeback..,"I've been a wreck for the past week or so with overwhelming emotions, thoughts and just not myself.. my friend who was dating my ex is now getting married to them which honestly I'm happy for both of them I am. But it's not that, it happened last weekend on Easter Sunday where she had texted me asking if I would be home for her to drop off an invitation I was like okay thats fine.. Needless to say, she shows up with her fiance (my ex) without telling me he was coming with her so that brought alot of past thoughts.. we dated in high school for about a year than he broke it off a few days after grad.. anyways, we tried to stay friends it was kinda okay but not the greatest.. So him and my best friend (we arent best friends anymore just kinda friends) started hanging out alot and he would always text her saying when he would be in town.. so they would hangout.. I get it that he was my ex and it would be akward to message me ask if I wanted to hangout too but honestly it hurt me alot when they did that, because it felt like they wanted to keep it low key as possible and didnt want me to be included.. there were times where he would get pissed off at me and mad when I asked him why he never told me he was coming and he would always say oh I post when I'm coming down and I dont have to tell anyone where or what I'm doing.. but he did with my friend which didnt make any sense. Things than just started getting worse, my best friend started to do the same thing where they would get mad at me as well when I would ask why she wouldnt message me and she would always take his side saying they would always text me or ask me to hang out but they never did! Not even once, and it got to the point where I didnt want to do this anymore and feel this hurt in my heart.. so I deleted them from my phone and Fb.. my friend and I kinda made up now but we arent close at all anymore and dont talk hardly ever..  anyways, as for my ex I haven't seen or talked to him in about 6 or 7 years so when he showed up with her it was so awkward, I almost had a panic attack in front of them.. I could feel my throat closing and my body shaking.. like i felt i was being suffocated by a tornado.. I just kept thinking I want to go back inside and I want to leave.. it was a very uncomfortable situation and I just can't imagine how it would be if I did go their wedding... especially when I have such bad anxiety, I wouldn't know anyone and I would be by myself! Is it bad to say no? Idk what to do, I feel like if I say no she would be upset  but if I say yes it would be a disaster and I dont need that happening especially on their day.. have any of you been in this situation before?? I really dont know what to do... ",depression
Easter,"Easter was good but then I had to come home back to reality, back to the very messy house and my mother telling me how she feels like she can’t even live in her own house and sits there crying.

Finally making a transition,"So, I made a decision, as I am the one that has the key to let myself out of the situation that I am in.  I made the decision to go back to school. It's done. I finished my intro. course and did well, and talked to my mentor, and I got a discount for the full course.  I have been learning to design web applications.  I never thought in a million years this was something that I would wind up doing, but I am doing it.  I had to ask myself, in the midst of all of this depression and misery, ""what could I do differently?""  After all, what is that saying: ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and getting different results.""  Yep. 
Things have gone from bad to worse in my job/career. Nothing has improved in fifteen years. Absolutely nothing.  I've tried everything I could, and at the lie of the sunk-cost analysis, I hung in there. Bad idea. I should have recognized early on that I was making the wrong decision, but what did I do? Out of a sense of duty, and becuase I spent SO much money-like $50,000 for a traditional college education, which I believe that the system really sells us a lie to an extent, only to come out with a dead-end career with no growth, no future, and constant verbal and physical abuse.  Things really went down this week when there was this tremendous argument when we were called in for a ""meeting"" at lunch.  I could hardly eat-I almost threw up. The entire staff was berated over the conduct of this one person who is very abusive.  This person then pointed at me and started to direct blame and negativity at me. I pushed back and it was not pretty.  Came home sobbing and exhausted. Typical day in the life in this career. Never-ending drama. Just never, ever ends. Nothing you do makes it better.  I've had five positions in fifteen years and frankly they have all been pretty awful. My salary is just about the same as the day I started.  In my state hundreds of thousands slammed the capitol to protest and we got a meager couple hundred dollars so I finally could open up a 401K.   Things just got worse this week when a behavioral health place moved in next door.  All I hear is ""f*** you"" through the wall with students in there...bloodcurdling screams...and then as I was working someone came and violently pounded on my door to try to force the way in.  All my complaints pretty much get ignored, or the responsibility just gets pushed back on me. And now my boss is telling me that my co workers feel like they are tiptoing around me since I pushed back at that guy getting angry at me. Oh well. I guess they just want complacence.  Yeah I have not been that much fun but I am so tired of it. I never hear anything positive.  All mediocre reviews and petty complaints such as ""we just don't like the sound of your voice..."" not sure what it is...give me a break.  I'm so done. I start school in June. Buh bye. ",depression
When depression gets in the way of life...,"I am a college student and this semester got increasingly worse to the point where I was no longer going to classes or even keeping myself and my room clean. I was forced to come home to work with my doctors and now am on new medications as well as being monitored due to the intense suicidal thoughts. I was planning on starting school again at a different university in the fall, but my family as well as my doctors do not think I should go back to school so soon. I absolutely know I want to pursue college and finish my degree, yet everyone around me says that school maybe just isn't for me. I feel like a complete failure that I couldn't even finish this semester... now I will be paying for schooling I didn't even get anything out of. It sucks. I have lived with this depression and anxiety for 7 years severely and it seems to only get worse. The horrible days have turned into horrible months and the idea of suicide becomes a closer reality every year which absolutley terrifies me. I feel like I am dying and I cannot stop the effects. Thinking of a life full of this feeling absolutely scares me and I hope that my life ends sooner than later if this is what my life will consist of. I am sick of medication after medication, dozens of impatient programs, therapy groups, and hospital visits. I have never struggled so much in my entire life and I am being told that I haven't even faced the real world yet. I can't hold onto friends, I push everyone away subconsciously. I am sorry for the negative post, but I feel like I am on my last leg and I am very close to not trying anymore.... especially because I have already tried literally everything that my doctors have suggested.

feeling alone and isolated,"  I have been away from this sitefor a long time. Today is an off day ( literally and figuratively ). Home alone and feeling so down. It's 75 degrees and sunny outside yet, I choose to sit and be in my pain!  The pain is emotional and psychological . Having endured many loses and brokenheartedness it is hard for me to reach out....... I think the greatest issue is that my adult and grown children lack of concern and what I feel is abandonment just hurts like hell. 
  I am sure thegeneration we are living in have what I call a spiritual virus of egocentricitym, yet it hurts .  All the years of being a single parent and doing the absolute best I could despite a second toxic marriage , my kids resnt her and I believe are brainwashed that I remarried after their mom diet. Sadly, the person I married and eventhough never sick in her lofe became hanidcapped 4 months later and I was left in a very difficult dilema.
   Writing this is a catharsis. Still  when I press send the pain and hurt will remain. It is very hard and I just feel sad and brokenhearted. I know and believ in my heart and guts I am a tough person mentally, but the decades have taken a tool. It isn't easy to turn off the heart's feelings and just say to hell with it!

“Short” suicidal episode...?,"so hi, I’m not on here much but I’m trying to be more active so I can reach out for support and see if others experience the same thing as me so we can lean on each other for support (I’m new to this particular group)...
that being said I was wondering if anyone else experience something like this bc I can’t find anything on it.

I will start fine and be totally okay, even exuberant at times. Either some small negative thing will be said between me and my fiancé or it’ll just happen for no reason and my heart just drops. As it drops I go into this trance like all of a sudden I’m not myself. It has different levels from “I’m so depressed that my body feels like rocks and I can’t move” all the way to “I’m a terrible person I want to die, it would be better if I didn’t exist.” It’s almost as if the world I know is just blurry and unrecognizable but at the same time I’m in reality, I know where I am and I’m aware of what’s happening. No hallucinations or anything like that either.. 
And a lot of times it’s like my brain just goes completely HAYWIRE and destructive terrible thoughts of how horrible I am and ways to hurt myself swirl through my head and it all spirals out of control..
I could start hyperventilating or something especially if this happens when I’m alone. It gets progressively harder to reach out bc I feel like I’m not worth anyone’s time although I feel like I’m literally dying and fading away on the inside bc of how utterly alone I feel in that moment but when someone catches on and tries to help I feel guilty. It’s like they could be doing something better with their time and energy and something to even elevate their mood positively instead of being around someone as depressed/ing as I am in that moment. It’s like I’m in a trance and I’ve stopped being the person I am but I still have some sort of construct of my control. All while I’m terrified bc it feels like it’s not enough control bc of my mental and emotional state. I’m always afraid my next episode will be my last.
The weirdest thing about all this is that my DEPRESSION episode may last for days, weeks at a time like normal. But these “meltdowns” (I call them that) last for like a day, very rarely will carry onto the next day. Sometimes the only thing to calm myself down and just SNAP OUT OF IT is cutting my thigh (nothing fatal, just pain/blood)

I just want to say (public announcement),"for those battling long term depression, .... have your THYROID levels checked by a Doctor/medical lab.  
""Primary thyroid disorders including both hypothyroidism (low) and hyperthyroidism (high) may be accompanied by various neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from mild depression and anxiety to overt psychosis.""
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246784/
1.  Hypothyroidism is very common.
2.  It is EASILY treated.  Usually one very small pill a day for low thyroid.
3.  The medication is NOT EXPENSIVE.
4.  It is a LIFETIME treatment.
5.  Most undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism is not realized by the patient.
Thyroid ... either too low or too high can MESS YOUR HEAD UP real good.  I know from first hand experience.  There is NO NEED to let thyroid be improperly regulated.  Have yours checked and make sure that problem is ruled out.

"Procrastinating sleep, avoiding work","Does anyone else procrastinate going to sleep on Sunday nights, feeling that typical dread when we don't want to go to work the next day? I've worked at this company for five years. The company has been great, going through normal ups and downs, but one of our team members were fired last week, and management has been very different lately, instructing us not to talk about anything unless it's work-related, and to stay in our seats as much as possible. It's been tough to be motivated at all. We've always worked hard, but now all eyes on us, and we're receiving a lot more reprimanding than rewards for our team as a whole.",depression

makes me really sick,"I don't know why...but this makes me really sick. There was a group of ppl that I was hanging out with a lot about a year and a half ago.  There was one guy there that I chatted with a lot, mostly because he was forcing the issue.  We exchanged numbers a really long time ago....he ghosted and never called...same old story.  And then things changed.  I had totally forgotten about it and lost interest, and then he started really honing in, I felt putting way too much pressure on me.  I started to get nervous.  It was a couple of halloweens ago that he made this big confession of his feelings, which kind of scared me and turned me off, and I was like, ""whatever,"" I was dating a lot of other people, and then started dating one of his friends. This did not seem to put him off, either. And then the following summer (last summer) he did the same thing, ""confessed his feelings""-again. And said that the reason that he attended the friend events was to see me. He started naming off and listing the events. I started to feel really uncomfortable. He kind of got this look in his eye, and he kept going on, saying that I was beautiful and that he feels so stupid (I was totally into someone else in the group). He is dating someone else now, but lists his status on social media as ""single."" I've noticed that he likes every single post that I put up, likes and comments on each one of them, no matter what they are.  I can guarantee and anticipate a comment every time.  I can even tell if there is an event, the minute I click on maybe, he clicks maybe, and if I click yes, he clicks yes.  I feel sick like my heart is in my throat whenever I see the notification that he's commented or liked on something else. I've started hiding all my posts and status from him.  I want to go to events but I'm afraid to go because if I rsvp I still have this feeling in the back of my mind that he is going because I am there (after all he told me this is why he comes). You'd think me dating his friend would be a deterrent, but I guess not.  I'd told him the last time I'd moved on and was dating other people. It still makes me nervous.",depression

I struggle with depression and anxiety . I have debt , am a single mom and I work a very dangerous job . I feel so alone right now and the depression hit me so hard .

making some decisions/change,"Visited my therapist earlier this week.  I actually only see her once a month but it's really helpful. She's so effective, just going there once a month is very effective.  Plus she is popular so she is booked.  She was very helpful with the horrible flashback and panic attack that I had a couple of weeks ago.  It was a real lifesaver to be able to have the therapist there.
I also am feeling much less depressed even though I am much busier. Ironically I thought this would make me feel more stressed, depressed, and much worse....but the opposite has happened. The long and short of it is that my career (as a teacher) has been a huge driver in the depression.  I deal with a lot of drama and combative people, and the pay (or lack thereof) is a real problem. I've attempted other fields and applied for other work with the education  and background that I have, for the past two years, and it's gotten me absolutely nowhere. So my anxiety was building.
I've always wanted an arts career, but I realize, now especially that i'm older, that this is very unlikely and that especially in a performing art, I am not going to expect to do some big thing and make a ton of money that way in midlife...talk about a midlife crisis if there ever was one.  I understand that I can do arts things on the side, but making money is not necessarily a guarantee.  I was going nuts realizing that an additional degree (I effectively have two) was out of the question and not worth it, esp. with student loans. I was starting to feel really seriously trapped. As I was driving to work the other day, the DJ on the radio seriously was telling the truth about the state of affairs for teachers (his wife is one) and he ranted like I've never heard. But everything he was saying I had been thinking, and I was thinking ""preach, brother."" He said that all teachers should quit today, get a job at Home Depot, and figure out what they are going to do.
Anyway, I am really getting off topic. I ended up seeing about this training program online, (almost on a whim, never considered this field) which is completely different than anything I've ever done before, but I took the plunge and did their intro. class. Amazingly, I seem to be taking to it and doing well.  I am quite surprised but a little scared at the same time. As soon as this class is over I will decide to go to the next step. Change is underway-and swiftly. After 2 to 3 years of a serious holding pattern I see change.  I told my counselor that I'm not going to be some famous artist tomorrow, this is very unlikely. I know that people say, ""go for your dream, the money  will follow."" I know, this is all very nice but with my first degree this is kind of what I did...and it came with some difficulty. I find myself taking to the new program well, and am evolving into some other person.  I feel far less depressed, if possibly not at all, because I can feel things moving and being underway. I'm just a little surprised at the swiftness of it and am a little scared. Wow.",depression
Wanting what’s best for me?,is there a difference between my family wanting what’s best for me and wanting me to be happy because I don’t know. I’m 21 years old and they say they wants what’s best for me but they won’t let me do what makes ME happy. They’re putting in my mind that I can’t hang around ceartin people because they don’t like their skin color being different than mine. They don’t want me being with certain guys because they don’t approve of their skin color. I mean isn’t the point of life doing what makes you happy and not doing what makes other people happy? They can’t tell me what kind of guys to like because what if one day I find the right guy and it’s someone I know they won’t approve of? How will I ever know what kind of guys I like and don’t like or what I want in a guy if they keep telling me what they think I want. I’m an adult and I just wanna find myself without people wanting me to do what they say even if they want me to do something I don’t wanna do.,depression
working with depression,"Hello everyone,
Gosh, I don't think I've been on here for at least 2 years. I remember when they first changed up the site on us. Many weren't happy. I'm gonna try to be more involved again because I need to vent. Just when you think you've gotten rid of your depression it creeps back up again doesn't it?
Even though I've been doing better with it, some days I really hate it. Like today for example. I volunteer for a support group app, and I'm one of the volunteers. Well, I got in trouble for making another profile account just for me. They have so many guidelines but I really love it on there, but I needed a place just to vent for me, and not being labeled. So when I got the message, I hate to admit it, but I cried. It's like I could never express myself in the app, but now that I'm a volunteer, well there are rules I have to follow, and I feel like I have to keep it professional if you know what I mean. 
When I was searching for support groups, I couldn't find any apps like the one I was volunteering for, so I thought I'd come back on here. See how many remember me, probably not too many! I just have to get used to this new look. 
Anyways, that's it for now. I just hate it when our depression gets in our way of working. Can anyone relate? This is one of the reasons why I wanted separate accounts! Oh well.

Running out of hope,"I've been a DS member for over 10 years. I will give you a short history of my medical situation so you have a better idea of what I am dealing with.
I was diagnosed with CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) in 2007. In 2010 I received my first ICD implant. I'm on many medications for the CHF in conjunction with the ICD. I am on my 4th ICD. Recently (December 2018-January 2019) was hospitalized with a Staph A infection.
I have also been diagnosed with congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease (mild), depression, anxiety, PTSD due to incidents from my ICD, am post gastric bypass, and was diagnosed as being bipolar.
In October, November, and December of 2018 I underwent 12 ECT treatments. My psychiatrist and I decided that meds were not helping enough & I was getting so bad to where I was thinking about suicide more frequently. No intent or plan but contemplated doing it. Then I had to discontinue my ECT due to my heart issues. By end of February, the heart issues were resolved and mentally I was feeling better. Saw the psychiatrist in March and we decided no more ECT and to keep my meds where they were at. 
I also see a therapist for ""talk"" therapy. I don't think he is helping because he always ends up doing most of the talking & I don't think our personalities mesh well. I'm going to request to see a female therapist instead. 
Fast forward to now...today. Since mid last week, the crying spells started again. Then the reduced appetite followed along with insomnia. Most days I don't get out of my night clothes & I cry multiple times for no reason at all. I have no interest in anything. I sit staring at the tv without focusing. Interest in hobbies...forget it. Interest in gettting outside...no way. I've basically gone on auto pilot. I'm alone every weekday as my husband is at work. I do have 2 dogs for company but it just isn't the same as having another person for company. I only get out of bed because of the need to care for the dogs and to take my medications.
I called the psychiatrist's office last week. His nurse has me starting with the approval procedure for getting ECT again. They asked if I wanted to try a different med but with all the other ones I am on for my depression (Bupropion & Sertraline) and my many heart meds...drug interactions are a major complication.
I'm lost. I'm finding myself to be in such a dark place. The hope I had of getting better and becoming stable is fading away quickly. I don't have anyone to talk to besides my therapist. No friends and my family members don't understand. My husband has lost all patience with me and resented having to take time off from work to take me to ECT. When I told him I was going to be starting up with ECT again, he rolled his eyes and said ""great, more vacation time I have to use."" Just hearing him say that made me feel so small and as though everything is/was my fault. I'm getting to the point of where I wonder why I am still here.",depression
I am tired of being silent,"To be honest, I just had a major out burst over a suit case. I will be traveling a for a few weeks to visit family and have been very excited about this trip for some time. I am a very organized person do I had already started preparing everything, because I knew that I would also be busy with school work and get rest prior to my flight so that I could enjoy myself. Well, I spent weeks talking to my mother about the weather and she told me that I should pack the little one some shorts for the hot weather....now she is say she has a lot going on and does not recall saying that the night before my early morning flight despite several on conversations with her about it. In addtion my husband waited until late night befor the early flight to start his packing despite me asking him to start the process at some point. Plus my house is a mess and I envisoned coming home to a clean house. All-in-all I am always silently worried and just wanted to relax for a change. But when I often have to remain silent on the things that prevent me from relaxing, nothing gets resolved. I feel like I have to conform to what makes others happy and comfortable before satisfying my own comfort. I usually have a lot to say but I am silent because, other say I offend them because I am too straightforward, even when I am nice about it. I literally exploded, and I think its from keeping everything in.......but it did not work because everyone makes my feelings about them and only focus on a problem I have with them  and not my frustration or interest in wanting to quickly brainstorm a solution rather dwell on negative stuff. This hurts me so bad because it makes me feel like a machine and not a human.  ",depression

Positivity,"Yes it can be extremely hard to be positive when you feel the world crashing in on and around you. I think this happens to most people, but I think we feel things more than others. Like depression is people who have too much emotion. The old expression that there’s people worse off than you. I think that a problem is a problem and that some can handle them better than others. I am always looking at the worst possible outcome but I’m also always looking for the silver lining. Today’s my Bday and I’m 40. That’s midlife crisis area on top of my depression and anxiety. But I’m still standing, and you know what there where some good times that where worth being around for. Sure there where probably more bad days than good. Probably more days that absolutely nothing happened good or bad. In reality it’s probably even good vs bad days, but I dwell on the bad days far to much and I think we all do. I don’t want to do that anymore. I can’t change the past but I can change the future. We all can change our future. Isn’t that what we all wished for as kids, to be able to change the future. Lucky us we don’t need a time machine or a delorean. All we need is a first step. ",depression

I just cant take this. I want to be free,"I'm scared. I wish I could just know what to do. I'm in college and I'm so afraid. I thought I knew what I wanted to study.

I just wish this could be easy, I like when I was younger and they just told me what to do. but now it's up to me to figure out things. I'm thinking of being a kindergarten teacher. in the very beginning that is what I was planning to study but fear made me change my mind. I was too afraid. I don't know if I could be a good kindergarten teacher. I have lots of experiences with children, I've done a lot of babysitting and being like a nanny. but I fear my mental health isn't good enough to do that. my depression, my anxiety, my eating disorder.

Pain...,"It takes a lot of work to be happy... but it's better than feeling constant pain. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression ever since I hit puberty in 5th grade. I didn't start therapy until 8th grade when I tried to kill myself. I've now been going to therapy for 5 years, I'm on zoloft (an antidepressant) and am on birth control to regulate my hormones because I have PMDD on top of already severe anxiety and depression. AND I've struggled with my sexuality, but have finally come out as gay to the world. It's been a long journey. A lot of days I still get that empty feeling of not wanting to do anything just complete and utter numbness; I have to force myself to do things, but once I do them I start to feel better. A lot of people would say I've got some bad luck, but maybe this is good luck in disguise that God has given me. I'm very empathetic, I understand others very well, I'm able to help people and give advice and I'm just able to put myself in others shoes.

"Be Encouraged everyone, Love honeybee","Hello All,
My name is Melissa (honeybee) and I have suffered with depression since 2009 when I was diagnosed with MS. It was a devestating time and only God could get me through it. My family supported me, particularly my  96 year old grandmothers (then 86), my angel of a mother, and my daughter. I thought my life was over and my wonderful doctor suggested medicine. I was raisd not to believe in medication for mental health, just pray and God will fix it. Well, I have learned that God uses medicinal methods as well just as He does with my asthma or medical need, anti-depressants have served to regulate my moods and offer me the necessary serotonin that I lacked neurologically.
It is now 10 years later and God has miraculously healed my body through my faith and medical regiment. I worked 20 years as a fifth ad sixth grade teacher and now I have transitioned into the therapy field as a counselor. I love it. It wasn't easy. I missed a lot of work and being an educator the stress was tremendous. My daughter supported me beautufully, but I regret putting a lot of burdens on her. I was in bed two summers straight before I found vitamin and medications to offer me a boost of energy to combat fatigue. It was a tumultous time and extremely frightening and ambiguous. I went to therapy one day and a lady asked me why I was there. I told her about my diagnosis. She goes on to say that I would end up in a wheelchair. I cried my eyes out and then talked to my sister who encouraged me and prayed for. I learned then that I would have to guard my pisitivity, my thought processes, and those I allowed to speak into my life. The Lord told me, ""I shall live an abundant life, and not die while declaring the goodness of the Lord.""
I still have challenging days, but my granddaughter has helped to combat those low moments. Surrounding yourself with loved ones and friends helps a lot. Isolation keeps us in a low place. Please keep believing me and knowing that you are loved and not alone. It's such a struggle at times because others don't always understand that there doesn;t have to be ""something wrong"" for a battle with depression. Fostering positive thinking and environments is critical. Talking to your doctors anfd therapists is critical.
I want to leave you with this, ""Wshatsoever things are pure, true, lovely, praiseworthy, of virtue, and of good report, think on those things. And the peace of God which passes All undertanding shall guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."" ( Phillipians 4:8).
You have a wondrous life ahead of you...please don't give up!!

Anger (trigger?),"I don't know what is wrong with me but for the past few months all I seemed to feel is rage.  I get triggered by the slightest things even small events. But it's mainly in justice over very serious things that have happened and others not so serious. I feel there are some people who have betrayed me, there are some others I just want to punch right in the face. It's does not good to ruminate on any of this it's bad for your health. I feel that some people have burned their bridges completely with me and I don't know how to face them again if I ever see them. Maybe it's a little dramatic but it's kinda where I'm at. With others the love has absolutely died.

Exhausted,"I honestly can’t see a future for myself anymore. Nothing makes me happy. I’ve tried so many different medications, different therapists, an outpatient program. I’ve tried keeping myself busy, I’ve tried taking time off and resting. It’s not even that I hate myself anymore, it’s just that I’m exhausted, and somehow that feels even worse. I’m tired of trying to feel better and faking it and then when I can’t fake it anymore, people say “you were doing so well, why did you stop trying?” Life just seems so silly and exhausting and I don’t feel like I was meant to be a part of it. I can’t function like everyone else. I try to open up and be honest with people, but no one seems to understand what I’m saying. They wonder why I can’t appreciate the gift of life and all my blessings and God has a plan for me, etc. But no one will sit with me through the pain. It’s uncomfortable for them, so they push it away. I can’t push it away. It’s stuck with me. And sometimes I feel I’d do anything to make it go away. If I say this though, I just end up hurting them. But if I keep it to myself they say “stop isolating!” Everyone around me seems to think my sadness can be cured by walking my dog or meditating or journaling. Sure, those things can help for a while or distract me, but it never goes away completely. In the end I still feel like a terrible person who wants to die. ",depression
Overwhelmed,"I am overwhelmed with all these responsibilities and tasks. College, work, and home; it's all out of balance and there's so much demand for me to do more...always more, never-ending. Do 20 assignments for school, deal with writeups at work that weren't my fault but I have to take the blame regardless, have to get a bigger house, have to deal with my partners new dog that misses him right now, have to do all this with a big smile on my face and a positive attitude while I don't have one right now. I must just be a wimp, complaining of things that everyone deals with on the day today. I'm just weak, can't do anything right or all the way, always behind in everything. Never good enough, just want it to end, but I know I can't because that would just cause more problems and I couldn't have that on my conscience or sole or whatever. I have no one to confide in right now, I'm alone for 6 more hours. I can't always talk to my partner because it can cause him to blame himself and then I have to calm him down, make him feel better then we have to move on. Nothing gets addressed, no relief, always building. I can't find any way to relax anymore, no way to keep myself calm, no way out. I suppress it until something breaks me again. I guess the positive side to this would be if I ever can get enough off my plate to relax then the rest of life will be a breeze.",depression
Self Sabatoge?,"I hate what I put as the title because my dad always says to me “you’re sabatoging yourself!” and it always makes me so upset. But maybe I am? I don’t feel like I do it on purpose. 
Like whenever a good opportunity comes my way, like school or a job or a social event, I always end up failing or not going. I’m not trying to “sabatoge myself” persay, but sometimes I’m just too tired to try. Or I want to try but I’m too anxious and bail at the last second. Or I try but get burnt out and quit. 
And then I think “what if I had actually stuck with that?” and hate myself for not doing so. Anyways, I’m just worried that maybe I am sabatoging myself because I have never thought I deserve happiness and I can’t see that for myself. 
I can’t see what other people see. I just feel like a terrible person and no matter what anyone tells me, I will never think I’m good enough for good things to happen to me. I constantly feel like a disappointment to everyone, and honestly, I wish I could just be gone forever, but I know it would just be that much more of a hassle for my family. ",depression
work,"Thank you for this board, for just having to have a place to post, and for the responses.  I am training for a new career as I am done listening to myself complain, as I sure are other people. I'm just about done with the first introductory course of a career path that I didn't think I was going to take.  I really enjoy what I am learning except for the myriad technical problems that I run into. Today my computer totally froze and I was unable to use it for a while.  I was however able to get it working again.  I'm at a point where I can fix basic technical issues, so I did not have to call anyone.  It took me about 2-3 hours to move TONS of data to an external drive.  It did get my computer working again though.  There was just so much data on it the thing choked up.  Then I had technical issues which delayed things another 2-3 hours so I short-circuted it and called it a day. My god.

I'm just hoping that somehow I'm not let go from my current position until I can progress through my new studies (I hate to utter this out loud and bring it into my reality).  The career is just not right for me.  There is every sign there that I've been on the wrong path these past 15-yes 15 years.  Yesterday there were two violent confrontations at the small high school at which I work, I could feel the anger in my body before the explosion (other people's-not mine). I was scared. I've seen a lot of violence in schools. Prior to that, there was construction going on outside so loud it was disrupting my classroom, construction workers shouting the f word, disturbing my students (my principal brought the head construction guy to talk to me about it-which I didn't like, after I brought it up to the prinicpal.)  The cleaning crew is paid their paycheck yet refuses to clean-we come to work to a restroom with filled up sanitary pads til we are going to retch, debris all over the floor, filthy tables, and I clean it myself now like a good 45 minutes a week it's so filthy.  The obstacles seem insurmountable. I feel like they pretty much turn a deaf ear.  I get petty complaints like, ""As an instructor, we just don't like the sound of your voice...just something about your voice...I dunno..."" How about go stick it?  Every job has been this way the entire career and I don't care anymore. I mean I would not like anything bad to happen, I need my paycheck, but it's like how much longer can this go on? I had one adult student shouting at another yesterday.  What do you do? I'd get some routine job while I finish my schooling but it seems these places don't want professionals for routine or menial work if you have a long resume.  I dont' know. I want to focus on possibilites.  I wake up earlier to get there on time, drive a long way, prepare all my meals ahead at night...still seem to always run a few mins late. The whole thing feels freaking impossible. ",depression
Waking up from naps depressed,"    Has anyone experienced this? I find that when I take naps I tend to wake up dissociating and depressed and need some time to coax myself out of it before getting on with my day. This makes naps in general incredible unproductive. It's as if I wake up a different person than I went to sleep as. 
    It doesn't happen with sleep, just naps! And the longer the nap the worse it is. ",depression

I'm feeling pretty down, I've been having self harm / self destructive thoughts for 3 weeks now and I gave in to cutting last week. I'm trying to use my coping skills but right now I'm just feeling so low like i want to die and I know I really don't, that's just the depression talking.

I've been doing great for a while until  now .....,"I know that I haven't been on here in a while. I've been doing great for a while until now. I don't want to deal with my depression meds because I think I'm a crazy person if I take them. I've been thinking about taking my own life to be with my loved ones who were important to me in my life. I've been thinking about self harm just to deal with the pain of losing my loved ones. I have a therapist. My therapist can only help as much as she can. When I don't see my therapist, I come on here for support and any help/advice from this group can truely help me cope. ",depression
Overcoming Jealousy,"I'm a third year biochemistry major who has been preparing myself for admission to medical school for some time now. Throughout my undergrad years, I've struggled with keeping above a B+ average due to complications with my health and disabilities, severe mental illnesses that I still deal with, and the recent loss of my father. I try my very best.
Today during my 8am lecture, I overheard one of my classmates announcing his acceptance into an early decision program for a medical school. While I'm very happy for him since he's a great person who works hard and absolutely deserves this accomplishment, I can't help but feel a little envious of him. Now, I'm not the jealous type. I don't believe in wishing for others misfortune because they have something I don't. I don't do bitterness and I will never wish ill for someone else. Nevertheless, part of me still wishes I was him. I think it stems from a self-esteem issue which is something I always knew I had. The way I interpret my feelings is that in this scenario, I envy this guy because he possesses characteristics and accomplishments that I've always wanted such as confidence, charisma, intelligence, humbleness, etc. The irony of it is that if I were to ask other people to describe me, they would use the same terms. I think when it all comes down to it, I need to stop comparing myself to others since my journey and struggles are obviously different from his. This is a hard pill to swallow because it's a extremely bad habit of mine. I hope that one day I'll reach a point where I'm comfortable with who I am.",depression
Had a relapse...,"I had a relapse. I thought I'd be okay, but i'm not. I hurt my back, and my doctor put me on oxy, and I thought I was doing okay, taking them as prescribed, but then I ran out and I started to get really sick. Its been a long time since I have been on the pills, but now I don't know what I am going to do. I feel like I can't go down this road again, it was so hard last time, and I didn't have a kid last time, I wasn't under all this pressure and stress last time. I wasn't married last time. I can't do this again. I can't go down this road again. I cant get bad again. I am scared to admit this to myself, to anyone else. I for sure can't admit it to my husband.",depression
Maybe ok to put here? Depression and divorce,"Where to begin....
So, the wife told me 6 weeks ago that she didn't want to be married anymore. I knew she was stressed with work and a bunch of things but I didn't, couldn't, see that it was this bad. She will barely talk to me at all. It was like a switch flipped and she was done. That day before we talked I had already decided that I needed professional help and I am doing that. For me. I started really examining my behavior and what was going on with me. Reading books on the subject etc. 
I have always felt different since I was little. I started remembering more and more. I was mentally, verbally and physically abused starting around the age of 5. My step dad was pretty violent. My mom must have known of at least some of it. I feel betrayed that she wouldn't help me. I did the best I could as a little boy. I put up walls. Built my armor. I learned that I didn't matter so pretty much nothing else did either. I sacrificed my vulnerability, compassion and empathy. I could always get along with people but I always held them at arms length. I never let people in. My shame was so great. That's the short version anyway.
2 years ago my step dad molested my brothers little girl. He went to prison. I was upset as anyone would be by such a horrible thing but I didn't realize that it triggered me. My mom continued to support him. When he got out I triggered again. So all this time I'm grumpier and not in my right mind. My relationship suffered. The wife was dealing with her own stresses. I was in a negative place.  
So, fast forward to now. I have been this way for over 30 years. It's all I have ever known. I blocked out a lot of that past stuff. The wife and I have been married for just under 6 years. I have let her in way more than I ever have anyone else. I see it wasn't enough for her and to be honest it's not enough for me now that my mind is waking up. I wan't so much more. To connect, to have passion, to hold her and let her know that I love her most in this world, to take joy in anything she enjoys. everything. 
Along with the usual growing apart a bit. Me doing my thing and she hers and not working on the relationship etc things suffered. I just couldn't realize what what happening at the time. Now that I have awakened it's so clear. I can see a way to fix everything. Be the person I want to be and have the relationship I want. It's so close! She is done. Nothing I can do. 
I know I have taken her and the relationship for granted and been a jerk at times. I own my part in getting to this point. It wasn't all me of course but enough of it was. To make matters worse, she is a therapist of sorts. I just wish she would have pulled me aside and said ""I'm not your therapist but I'm worried about you and us. I'm seeing that there is stuff going on with you. I can't go on like this. We need to do something."" It would have woken me up so much sooner.
She says it's too little to late. She feels it was a betrayal of trust in our relationship to not share my past abuse with her. I really tried to tell her that I didn't mean it like that. I didn't even remember almost all of that until my world turned upside down and I really started thinking, self examining and seeing a therapist. I have hurt her trust. I see no way to get that back as of now. It doesn't matter that I want what she wants. I really understand what she was trying to tell me now.
I'm fighting a battle on 2 fronts. My horrible childhood past and dealing with her not wanting me and getting a divorce. She is not interested in talking or hearing about my past. I'm kind of on my own with that. I don't know that I can deal with all of this. I have fought so hard to start to improve myself and understand what I was doing and why. I know my therapy is for me but she was the catalyst. I faced this for her, for our relationship. It breaks my heart. I'm too late. She says she cares for me and loves me but is not in love with me. No matter what I do. My emotions are a bit unchecked right now. Everything is waking up. I'm desperately trying to keep whatever progress I have made so far and not put those walls back up to protect myself. If only she would agree to a short time of trying couples therapy just to see. I know people can get that spark back. It happens. I feel depression and despair kicking in a lot. I can't eat much. I can't sleep much. It's hard for my to find joy in things that I like. 
Talking to people, especially people that understand, helps. Other times I'm unraveling....

Been away too long,"I haven’t been on DS as much as I would like or even as much as I need to be. Things have been up and down left and right these past few months. But I’m still here keeping up the fight. I can honestly say that coming here has saved me. I can be myself whether I’m happy or sad and that I know I’m not alone, that there’s others like me out there. I wish non of us had to be in situations that we need a place like this but since that’s the world we live in I’m glad we have a place to commiserate LOL... I can come here ready to give up and see someone that needs a kind word or some help and that makes me feel better. Being able to help, not that someone else is feeling like I am. Again I wish there was no need for places like this. So to all who have reached out to me thank you so much and to all those who I have reached out to, keep on going. And remember sometimes just saying a kind word to someone can brighten your day. Things may seem bleak now but better days are ahead. ",depression
mentally exhausted,"Hi, I just recently stumbled on this website while trying to find help for my depression. It feels strange sharing how I feel and I'm not sure what to write but I thought I'd give it a try. 
I've been depressed for 4 years. I got help and was seeing a social worker on and off. I even tried antidepressants when things got bad but experienced negative side effects. It was quite scary. I've never been more terrifed and scared of myself then when I become suicidal. 
I don't even understand why I'm always depressed. I feel extreme guilt for feeling this way when I know there's no reason for me to be depressed. I'm healthy. I can see, hear and breath. I have access to food and clean water whenever and wherever. I have a roof above my head and a bed to sleep in at night. 
 It's like I've never really gotten better no matter how hard I tried. It feels like the more I fight it, the worst I become. I'm depressed all year round. I never go a day without feeling depressed. 
During the fall, I start to feel really depressed, discouraged, hopeless and mentally tired.  I know it gets worse from here. I have to mentally prepare myself for the winter. That's when I fall into a deep depression and become suicidal. I am consumed by darkness. It's an extremely scary period for me. I do not recognize myself. It's as if someone took over my soul, my body, my mind if that made sense. I can't physically and mentally function. I can't decide if waking up wishing I could sleep forever is harder then going to bed with all the noise in my brain getting louder as it gets darker and quieter at night. It's as if the devil is working hard to make me miserable and i'm just barely holding on a thread.
I'm living a nightmare I can't escape. I get anxiety going outside, being around friends and family. I tend to withdraw myself from any social activity/gatherings. I isolate myself in my room, refusing to go out. I had to dropout of school because it was unbearable. I couldn't sit through an entire lecture let alone listen for barely 10 mins or even have the energy and focus to read one page. I had extreme difficulty concentrating and couldn't focus on anything at all. 
Since I wasn't in school I had to get a job. I couldn't sit around and do nothing with my life. My parent's were really upset and disappointed at the time and still are four years later today. 
When I get a job, I don't even last long. I end up quitting and not showing up one day because it's so stressful and overwhelming. I could barely handle working 20-30 hours a week. It wasn't even full time. It's so hard to do little things like getting out of bed or taking a shower for fuck sakes. During the period, I wasn't working or in school, I would lay on the couch, wrapped up in a blanket just staring at the ceiling consumed by my depression days at a time.  I would then often told I'm so lazy. I'm not lazy. I'm just suicidal but I would never tell anyone that.
I can't put into words how I feel. No words could describe how much pain i'm in. I can't remember the last time I was happy. How it felt to be genuinely happy. The darkness is all I know. It's what im used to. It just feels normal at this point. 
I always have to tell myself to take things one day at time but even then a day feels like an eternity.  There's no such thing as a day in my brain. Because I get up and it's the same damn thing again. I can never escape. I don't know how to shut my brain off. I just can't. The noise is so loud at times. It goes on all day. It's a constant battle with myself. It drives me insane. All I do is sleep all day because it's the only way I know to quiet my mind. Its like the day never ended. I'm just stuck living the same day. Weeks goes by next thing you know it's been a year then two and you wonder how the fuck did things end this way. How can I let myself go? 
I hate myself for feeling this way when I'm turning just 20 this year. I have so much to live for. How can I complain when people have it much worst then me. Who am I to feel like this at just 20?  I feel pathetic and useless. I always feel irritated, frustrated, disgusted,  angry, anxious , miserable, hopeless, lonely and the list goes on. When I am depressed, I feel a rollercoaster of strong persistent negative feelings. They never go away.

Every year I know how it starts and ends. I always set myself up for failure. It's a vicious cycle. I'm truly scared that this is how it's gonna be for the rest of my life. Maybe I'm just one of those people, you know? Maybe I serve a purpose being depressed for the rest of my life as stupid as it sounds. I just wanna believe in anything at this point. I have to believe in something, anything.

If you've made it this far. Thank you for listening.
One day at a time.
One hour at a time.
One minute at a time.
One thing at a time.
It's what I tell myself everyday.

I'm New,"I have just recently learned of this website and of these groups. I am so happy to have found a place to share and listen in a group that fits within my schedule. While I'm not diagnosed with depression, nor do I claim that I have it; I do have depressive tendencies and it often affects my relationships (family, friends, and my fiance'). I'm 20, almost 21; I don't know how to cope with or handle these tendencies as well as some other mental problems I experience. I don't know how to use my resources, as you read, I only just found out about this site. I'm glad I found this place because now I just might find the help and support I need to be the best me I can be and not put that kind of stress on my partner.

I Don't Want to be Me Anymore,"I don't want to be from the East Coast. I don't want to have my past. I don't want to be tied down anymore. I want to quit my job. I want to leave Denver. I want to bleach my hair and get a leather jacket and a bike and live on the road. I don't know why I am saying any of these things. I just want peace. I want to be free. My best friend convinced me not to commit suicide the other day... not sure how, but he did. Our texts went something like this:
Me: I'm going to kill myself.
Him: You can't.
Me: But I want to.
Him: Well you can't.
Me: Why not?
Him: Dying is easy. Living is harder.

The conversation progressed until finally I was calm. Today I got severely overstimulated and had to lie down in my darkened bedroom inthe fetal position with an ice pack on my head, my body wrapped in a big plushy blanket. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME??? I just wish I had a different life. I want to be free.",depression
Where do I go from here,"I need help... to start, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Chronic Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar & lastly in process of determining whether I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm service connected & lately been seeing my social worker once a week. I'll also be seeing my psychiatrist once a month. I'm on so many meds that I don't know what works or what doesn't. 

In the past year I've checked myself in for 72hr evaluation. Recently, I put my gun to my head... (I threw an unnecessary temper tantrum) My mood swings are destroying my relationship with my girlfriend. I say I'm gonna do something then don't do it. I have no want to do anything at all throughout my day. She wants me to get out & meet people. We went to the American Legion for st. Patrick's day & yes I... we had a great time. We discussed me joining the Legion to make friends & do something meaningful with my time. It's been almost a month now & I kept thinking about the Legion coming up with reasons why not to join. My biggest reasons are that I don't want to bury anymore of our brothers & sisters. I've seen too much death & it kills me to think about burying anyone else. Second, I really do not want to do any parades. The crowds make me super uneasy. The only reason I could think of as positive is cheaper beer. That's not a good enough reason... infact, that's the wrong reason to join the legion. This is a cycle, once or twice a month I become mean & intolerable to others. There's much more that I've done hurting those around emotionally. I don't know what else to do short of joining the legion as my girlfriend wants me to do. I don't want to do it just because she wants me to. I want to want it. Am I afraid to? Yes & i don't know why. 

Please... I don't want to lose her. I need help.

Edit: she's pregnant with our baby. She told me she's not keeping it as I can't be trusted. I can't blame her a bit. I want so badly to have this baby with her.",depression
Another tough week,"Another tough week. I'm dealing with my mental health on a daily basis. My behaviours have become so normalised that panic attacks are just part of my day, I struggling to eat and sleep. I am using alcohol and weed to give my head a break. Can't seem to stop the negative and destructive mental chatter. Iv not been to the doctor because I'm getting through and I fear il be hospitalised. I really don't want that. Everyday comes with moments of great sadness and dispair. Suicide is never far from the front of my mind and the way it comes so freely to me frightens me. I never used to he like this and I really try to put a happy face on things but it's difficult ",depression
Falling apart,"I'm new.... my main two triggers are my autistic twin tweenagers that are behaving in a combative way that is beyond more than I can handle in my current frame of mind. (Hint: frame is cracked, moulding missing chunks of paint and resin, and some staples wriggled out and got lost).
My next trigger is my marriage. I coldly confess I just dont have anything left for that after the exhaustion in the first paragraph.

So I am starting a new slew of meds. I don't see a difference yet, but I hope it's just too soon for the lifechanging results portrayed. 

But I feel like a lobotomy of sorts would help. I feel I stopped being a person years ago, and if I could somehow be hypnotized into enduring this role of maid, chauffer, emotional punching bag,
familial servant, unqualified special needs educator, completely ineffective behaviour therapist......... if I could do that with the clinical detachment of a researcher.... maybe I can get thru it. Is there a pill or procedure for that? 

Because im about to break from feeling this frustrating debilitating sadness. And my kids will unfortunately witness it until either it or I go away.

weird triggers,"Does anyone else ever get weird triggers?

He posted pics of them at a carnival...etc...honestly to me I felt like vomiting.  And when I was at a fair recently I passed by a carousel, etc, and a heart-seat where people were sitting and taking pics. I felt so sad I just kept walking with my head down. It was pretty horrible. Does anyone else ever get these kinds of triggers, not serious flashbacks, but reminders that make them feel sad?",depression

Help my boss is a narcissistic.,"I am a widow and empty nester.  After being a stay at home mom for years focusing on everyone else I was thrust into a position where I had to be the breadwinner. By the grace of God somehow I pulled it off long enough to finish raising my kids, but now that it is just me; I am struggling.  Trying to find where I belong. What I want to be when I am grown up, except that I am 51.  Everyone expects me to have my act together. 
My boss enters the room and asks me what I am going to do for the weekend and if I am honest I get lectured about how I should not bring my problems to work because right now life sucks. Then he says everyone’s life sucks but they don’t show it.  Then he asks if I am going to ride a roller coaster at six flags. In gest I ask if he is paying, then he says he would never see me outside of work because that would not be professional. Wow! Where the fuck was his head?  
How the fuck am I supposed to answer this asshole? I can’t be honest! He doesn’t care. I can’t joke around, he takes it seriously. 
I feel like I need to confront him in front of everyone to get him to stop especially since he left it looking like I have a thing for him when he is the furthest thing from my type there is.

"disappointment, ill will, guilt, being outcast?","
Thank you for being here, for letting me rant. At times I feel crazy. Anyway...it does help for me to write and to get it off my chest.
Romantic relationships have been terrible for me. Full stop. They have always ended horribly. There, I said it. I've done therapy, support groups, etc, on this topic, yet, here I am coming up on the big 50 and I am empty-handed in the romance department.  A terrible feeling. It wasn't for lack of trying, I will admit that.  I've come up against SO much rejection, I can't even...  I've had several relationships that I'd wished from the bottom of my heart, truly, that would have worked into marriage; they didn't. Sometimes I broke up if I felt I had to, and others I was broken up with. I feel at this point I may be facing my older age alone. It could happen.  And, unfortunately I feel that at this point, people that I am dating at this stage of the game, well there is usually something the matter...sorry but it's the truth. Usually they turn out to be married, or just need a woman for money. I hate to admit this but it is a different playing field than when I was in my 30's.
I am getting off topic. But my focus here is the last disappointment which for me was crushing and terrible. I know it sounds dramatic but that's how I feel. I don't know why this one was so particularly awful; I guess because I regarded him as a friend and kindred spirit. I've been brutally and meanly rejected by narcissistic men who were not my type; pretty, athlete types who felt they were superstars...but they were not my type anyway and it was shallow. This person, on the other hand, was a personal friend of mind with whom I had much in common and we'd talked about dating. He said he was interested in a relationship with me and we'd even set up plans. We were in the same tight-knit social circle and shared personal things. Only he turned around and never kept our plans and then the concept of a relationship went into thin air somehow. I'd felt he'd gone cold simply because I reciprocated the interest and it almost seemed like he was punishing me just for the reciprocation; it felt like he had some underlying hate for women, I couldn't put a finger on it.
I found myself suddenly on the outside of our social circle, that I was removed from his close friends' party guest list and was shocked and horrified to learn that they had a holiday party (all of our 'friends') and I was deliberately removed/excluded. (And this was right after one of our hangouts and close personal talks)  Saw all the pics the following day.  I felt stabbed right in the back. I started to feel hatred (I feel guilty) and when he stated dating someone much younger and prettier, I secretly wished it would fall apart just for what I felt ""he did to me.""  It did fall apart: abruptly and full stop- after a whirlwhind- probably not because of the energy of my ill-will, but because he simply is an idiot. I'd always wondered how he could maintain a relationship being so disingenuous. Well I guess he doesn't.  There is a sick satisfaction in being right, but this is not true happiness for me. 
I tried to hang onto the last remnants of my own decency, and to ""be a friend"" and realize that ""he's just not interested"" and ""I'm taking it too hard,"" and that I need to get over my ill-will and wish him well; when I wake up to find out that he's now gone and removed our friend pics from my timeline. (he had to go back two years to do this) I feel that the last thread of any connection is now removed. I fought over the past couple of years, no matter how crushed and hurt I was, just to put on a smile, to realize that we could ""just be friends"" even if he couldn't reciprocate romantically...but now I see something different. I see a person who possibly may have gotten me excluded from the group (I don't know) and has removed any trace of me.  Vindictive? Self-involved? Wow, ok, just wow is all I can say.  I am just sitting here shaking my head. Another guy in the same group I dated lied about being married, and when I found out, well...he blocked me on facebook.  Imagine that...as though I were the culprit. And when I see him at events he leaves. Talk about feeling eradicated/outcast from others' lives. It's like they never knew me...you'd think if you even wanted to be civil you'd mind your actions. I don't know. Like I wouldn't notice this? Are you *trying* to collect enemies and ruin your karma? My god. 
I still get invitations from the friend group at large and I want to be a part....I hate feeling so lonely.  but....I try not to go when the original person is there. Mr. Married never comes.  I generally will attend if original guy does not rsvp, but he's started to show even when he doesn't rsvp, so I can't predict. I almost wonder if he does so to lose me. And there seems to be a pattern where he uncannily is not at the events where I am at, and I am never there when he comes. Somehow I wonder if this on purpose or planned by all the bros. ""Oh, she liked him...keep her out of here..."" Geez.  Just a funny thought. He is *sorely* mistaken if he feels I am attending to see him, in fact I am trying to dodge him at this point. I wish I did not have such hatred for another person. It's so wrong.  When can I attend without rancor? And who's to say he will be cordial if I am there? After all he removed our pics.  The last time I was at his house for an event he was quite nasty I thought, waved me off like a fly on trash. Some mens' opinion of themselves is terribly out of alignment with others'  view on them. All this may be conjured and misconstrued in my mind but somehow I doubt it. I have an uncanny way of turning out to be correct, it's sad.",depression
Looking for advice,"Thinking of going back to school. Medical administrative/coding.  Been out of school for over 10 years.

I don’t even know anymore,i just get so angry so quickly and then i get really sad .

What to do,"things have been going well , until today. My boyfriend got slammed with child support papers for a kid he’s never met nor has signed the birth certificate for. She’s about two years old and he didn’t believe she was his. Now he has to go to court to do a paternity test. I know he doesn’t think she’s his, but I know she is. She looks just like him. I know he’s going to have to pay child support, and if she’s his rightfully so, but the thing is, I just found out I’m pregnant a few weeks ago. So I’ve been desperately saving money to try to prepare,  and it’s been stressful just doing that. Now this happens and I know it’s going to be more money. I haven’t been in a situation like this, nor do I know much about how issues with child support work. Right now my main priority is my unborn child. It’s depressing me, because I feel like I’m not going to be able to do this with other bills every month as well. I make more money than my boyfriend now, so he probably couldn’t afford it if it happens without my help as well. I guess I just feel kind of stuck at the moment. ",depression
overwhelm/trigger warm,"Hi Everybody,
I posted in the PTSD forum which was helpful; I'll try not to go on too much of a huge ramble but it's hard.  Feeling a big sense of overwhelm. Luckily I have local support.
Where do I start? I don't know.  I suppose I should pare it down here.  I started therapy back in fall when I realized that my past abuse was catching up with me.  I started to feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety. In short, there was intense sexual harassment going on at my job.  Human resources did little to nothing to help, forcing a crisis.  This compelled my secretary and myself to quit; we had no choice but to find other work.  I am a high school teacher.  Two female students complained about him; they ended up dropping out.  I found myself spinning in a whirlpool of present crisis and past trauma all in one. Hence therapy.
If they say everything happens for a reason, I suppose this is quite a reason.  Fast forward to now (last week Thursday).  I was sitting at my computer, white-knuckled.  I am typically terrified to go out because I frequently attract predators and stalker types, but this is not too uncommon for people of my background, and if you believe in law of attraction or anything like this, it makes sense, you attract what you resonate with.
Anyway, I work a lot. I teach fulltime and because I feel like I'm at a dead-end career-wise, I've decided to go back to school for a totally different field, which is quite draining financially and emotionally. I'm overdrawn, literally and figuratively. So, because I push hard, I decided I wanted to go out on the weekend, but there was that small voice, (again) in the back of my head, telling me, ""your friend's husband, he sure seems obsessed with you, even though there will be hundreds of people at this party, he will find you and accost you."" I tried to tell myself that I've reduced contact with them way down and that I'm not hanging out with them privately anymore, and that I have the right to go to a party...well the universe had other plans and may have been warning me.  The moment I walk into the place, the comedian is laughing, saying that he's sure found domestic violence profitable because he's spackled tons of drywall in his construction business, mocking in front of like 300 people.  All the sudden, flashes of me spackling drywall, smoothing it over, doing paint matches, the smell of paint, the tacky sensation of spackle and I really had a fit. Some nice guy asks me what's wrong and takes me to the courtyard and lets me freak out and cry and gives me a cigarette.  He's helping me out...what happens next?  The ""friends'"" husband comes barreling out, starts shouting at me, just like I was afraid of and out come the lines out of his mouth, ""You are so f&^%$ up!!!  You need to get high, get on my massage table (naked) let me work on you and un*&^% you!!!"" He is pointing and screaming at me. This is exactly the spiel he gives me every time I run iinto him-I'm to get naked, get high, and do what he says, no refusal. At this point I'm really terrified now.  The past few years in therapy I talked about them, I was suspicious of them, I pared down my relationship with them to about 5 to 10 percent of my time with time from 90 percent of my time, over the past two years or so, and now it will be down to ZERO.  He's got me hating him more than ever now.  I actually think he's dangerous at this point. I don't associate with family now, I'd considered his friends to be my family, but as far as I'm concerned he's dangerous and maybe I can't even be friends with his friends...who have me over for Christmas every year cause I've really no where to go because the domestic violence was with my family. I'm afraid he and his friends may be a package. I don't know if I can separate them out.  I really feel he's shown his true colors.

Not Normal,"I don’t know if I’ll ever be a “normal” person again. The littlest things set me off. Like today I was with my dog on the couch and my dad saw and yelled “get off of there! I just cleaned that...” and I thought maybe I just shouldn’t live anymore since I mess everything up. Maybe I was just meant to die young. 
And I’m tired of putting on a fake smile. People have no idea how much I’m hurting because I’m so good at hiding it. Someone from my church was telling me about her daughter who has an eating disorder, self-harms, and is suicidal, asking me for advice because she thinks I’m a good influence. She has no idea I’m every single one of those things and am in no position to give advice because I can’t even fix myself.
People have no idea that it’s a really big deal if I show up to something because right before then I was thinking about dying. Whenever people talk to me it’s “what are you doing with your life? Do you have a job? Are you in school?” Like no, actually right now I’m just trying not to hurt myself everyday and it’s kind of hard to concentrate on other things. 
I go to therapy, I take my medications, but it never stops. I can tell people are tired of me, frustrated that I’m not “better” yet because it’s been a long fucking time. I lost all of my friends, either because they were tired of putting in effort for me or because they got all uncomfortable once they found out I’m not okay. I get it, I’m tired too. I’m weirded out by myself too. I just told my parents my dog is my best friend and they laughed but I’m not fucking kidding lol. It seems like the only “people” that aren’t disgusted by me these days are my dog and my 1 year old nephew. And I think “I can live for them.” But sometimes I don’t know if I can. I’m hurting so badly and it’s such a deep pain. I don’t want to hurt anymore.",depression

Made a mistake but laughing about it,"    Today I made the nastiest looking swiss roll cake ever! It was a matcha cake with strawberry cream in the middle. The picture showed a soft, lovely spongy perfectly rolled circular cake. Mine came out fatter and flatter than a manta ray, burnt brown on the outside and cracked, with cream spilling out like guts. Plus the green and red color together made for a visual abomination. I described it to my friend as a freshly shat koala crap. I couldn't stop laughing about it. Expectation's vs reality? 
    I'm happy that I can laugh about this kind of thing nowadays. I'm told and have confirmed that it still tastes delicious. I don't feel like beating myself up about it anymore. It's nice to not be taking things so seriously anymore.

Horrible Day,"I got my ass kicked today at work. We were slammed from beginning to end. I got a rejection email regarding a job I had applied to. I had a nasty falling out with his guy I've been dating. He called me a liar. I said ""fuck you"" and blocked him. Sorry if I don't have a nice make-your-own-hours job and therefore can't meet up with you whenever. Sorry that my job drains the crap out of me. Am I ever going to find someone???? Or am I just fated to be a fuck buddy all my life? I'm meeting a guy for coffee tomorrow morning, but I don't think it's going to work out. He's very leery because a) I don't know if I'll stay in the Denver metro area for more than a few years and b) I don't post full-body pics. He has kids, and I respect that they will always come first (actually, it would be a red flag in my mind if they didn't). So I get that he wouldn't be able to move. But I'm not totally happy here in Denver, and the fact that he's insisting on full-body pics makes me really uncomfortable. My nighttime eating is really stressing me out. I know it's bad for me and yes when I come home I'm exhausted and mentally/emotionally drained. So I eat things. I'm sorry, I just needed to vent and get this whole slew of poison out of my system if I'm going to be able to sleep tonight... And wake up to go on a date that will probably not amount to anything, and then to a job that takes the life and soul out of me. Yes I'm fully aware that I'm wallowing in self-pity right now.

chronic pain and Depression on Dyalasis,"I had two twin boys on hemo dyalasis I and I suffer from depression and anxiety have chronic pain and lately I'm so sad and depressed i feel like I'm watching things from far away can't connect with life and sometimes feel like I am disengaged from everything and I'm so angry all the time I am having trouble feeling any joy in life anymore I dread dyalasis days and some days feel like I would rather just stop and not do it anymore. Life is like this endless cycle doing the same thing over and over again. I don't get to get out much and feel like my home has become a prison im stuck in.
I think bout my twins and my husband and I feel like it would be a awful for them to have to go thru losing me but at the same time I am having trouble feeling like I can even get thru the day and part of me sometimes fill they be better off without me as a burden. I know I probably need to see a doctor but I have had such a problem in my life in my area finding doctors who are willing to treat me. I have next to no kidney function so when it comes to my pain problems they just throw their hands up and say ethey are not comfortable medicating me with anything strong enough to make me comfortable and ease my pain and same goes with people I have seen about my anxiety and depression no one wants to help enough. I've been on meds but they don't make me feel much better and it makes me feel hopeless. If I have no hope of getting the help I need them what's the point cause at  this point I'm making my whole family  miserable and I feel like they would miss me but I'm such a pain they would have to be happier without me.I'm waiting to get on the transplant list but with doctors not wanting to help me now is that really going to get any better with a transplant. I have had a kidney transplant before as a kid and they were still so hands of then so really I feel so lost and have contemplated suicide or just stopping dyalasis treqtment for lack of doctors willing to help with pain/aniexty/ depression.
I was just wanting someone to connect to that was maybe going thru some of this to I have tried talking to family but besides my husband the rest of my family kind of rolls their eyes and acts like I'm being a baby and does not really take my feelings seriously I am prone to panic attacks due to my anxiety and they just help at me and tell me to suck it up that I have to deal my kids need me and it just hurts and I feel like I'm lost  and  don't know what to do is it really better just to on for children I just want something to make me happy and feel  normal and not taken advantage of like I'm just here to keep up my parents house and wait on everyone while my mom works and I but heads over my son with my mom I feel like she would be happier to just have my son as her own she acts like she is his mom not me as that I can't even move out cause she won't let me take my son with  mme and she completely ignored the other twin theirs more of a story this but I'm getting off topic I just feel so stuck in life and it going to joyless and painful I just don't know how to keep pushing thru all of it",depression

I've had a lot happen to me in my life. This is the first year of my life (litterly) that I've been trauma free. Nothing horrible has happened and I'm starting on processing some of my trauma. 
That being said my depression is worsening. I've been bouncing around therapists since August and have been in the hospital 3 or 4 times since then. I also have DID (Dissociative identity disorder once known as multiple personalities). That is a huge battle as well.
I'm also dealing with chronic pain. 
I can't seem to get out of my funk. I've been out of the hospital now for 11 days. I was there for 24 very long hard days. It was a trauma unit that specializes in ptsd and DID. I did a lot of hard work but I don't know how much help it did me? 
I've been fighting severe hopelessness and helplessness everyday since I've been home. I'm trying to force myself to do things so I'm not spending all day in bed. Today I did some cleaning. Kinda proud of myself for forcing myself to get up and clean. 
Tomorrow afternoon I see my therapist. She's new but promising.

I hate myself. I dont know how to live with myself,"I'm a very sensitive person and I hate it. I get so hurt by people, mainly people I trust and they don't even know they hurt me because I don't tell them and most of the things shouldn't even be a big deal to be hurt. This makes me even more depressed.
I feel like no one wants to be my friend or wants to be around me. to explain, I'm a college student and its been hard making friends. I think I made two friends at this school. but it's so hard to keep them as my friends. I feel like im so annoying and even if I say sorry for the way I am, I still feel like im annoying. I feel like I don't know how to have a friendship. I've been having problems with my two friends. My first friend, she hurt my feelings and I don't know how to tell her or I don't know how to just move on. She hurt my feelings in 3 ways. First I text her to see if she wanted my Rice Krispie treats because I had to many and I didn't want to binge eat them. I text her like last week and she never texts me back so I ended up giving them to someone else. then one time we were hanging out at night, she was doing her homework then just got up and left me and went out with other friends. I guess I was jealous that she left, I think I could of went with her and her friends but I didn't want to feel like a 3rd wheel.  she isn't a bad friend. she was there for me when I was suicidal. im very grateful to have her as a friend. that she even wants to talk to me and be my friend. I think most of this is just maybe miscommunication. I wish I was better at talking to people. I feel like I'm not a good friend. yes, I care a lot about people but I just don't think im good at friendships. I get so lost in my mind. My mind tells me things that I don't think are true or I hope aren't true. it tells me things like people hate you and you are a big failure. 
I feel like because of this I'm missing out on so much. We could be having fun and going on adventures like to Walmart and target and malls and just being free and having fun. I don't want to look back and regret not having as much fun. I feel like im not living life. I'm so trapped in my depression, anxiety, eating disorder. all of this is just taking over.

Psychosomatic Pain,"So, last year, I started having unexplained muscle and joint pain throughout my whole body. It gets worse with use and I can't walk for more than like 10 minutes before I hurt a lot. The pain does not go away until I sleep for the night, which doesn't always happen. I have been diagnosed with polyathralgia and polyarthritis, which is really just the symptoms. I've seen two doctors, a rheumatologist, and a physcial therapist and they all say that there is nothing medically wrong and that it's related to depression. They then tell me there is nothing more to do beyond the therapy and medication I'm already doing. I can accept that it's from depression, but I cannot accept that I can't do anything about it.
I was wondering if anyone had any advice on this type of pain caused by depression. Are there things I can try that might help relieve the pain? Pain relievers make me sick and I do go on walks when I can. Changing my diet is not currently finacially possible, and I haven't notice a food correlation anyways.
Thank you.",depression
Grad Student_Grief of estranged father.,"Hi Everyone! I am a grad student and recently experienced the death of my estranged father. Unfortunately, his untimely death has caused serious depression, sadness, and grief. I only saw this man 3x in my 30 years. I  study psychology (mental health) and thought I would have all the answers to my own situation. Instead, I experienced my own counseling, backing away from my clinical experience, and not recommended to take summer classes. Not to mention postponing my graduation to 2021.  I never thought his death would affect me in the worse way and time. I have to delay my doctoral program to focus on (grief). This is hard and I am doing it by myself in another state away from my family. What to do? Every day is different and signing my name on those documents to postpone clinical experience and graduation was the hardest decision I had ever made. I felt numb inside all over again. I have to finish my other spring term classes and advised to focus on me. ",depression

Guilt for how I feel...,"hey, so I haven’t posted for a while.
life has been pretty hectic... massive ups... 
massive crashes back down.
i feel guilty for being depressed. I got engaged on Sunday and in terms of my relationship with him, I’ve never been happier so far... cloud nine whenever I think about it but everything else is still there....
Don’t get me wrong o never expected to just suddenly vanish, but a ‘friend’ told me that I “need to get over my depression now, and all my other mental health issues because I’m lucky to have him”
yes, I am lucky to have him, and yes, he deserves the best of me, but he knows the worst of me and those feelings stem back 15 years before we even Met.

can't keep pretending,"I am into the ""feeling REALLY depressed"" mode.  I've been pretending everything fine, and that I want to be some what part of the people around me, BUT I DON'T.   I don't want to do anything,  I feel done,  just done putting forth effort to do anything.  I don't want to eat, drink, and I don't even care anymore about whether I sleep or not, I don't care that my body hurts all the time,  I don't care if I live or if I die.  not suicidal,  not like that, but just empty, the real meaning, is there is no meaning, the only thing that's guaranteed is death, I don't want to watch tv anymore, I don't want to smile and listen to others, I don't want to be a part of any social group, I just want to be done.  In my religion, it's exceptable to starve oneself to death,  that also gives you a lot of time to get over what ever screwed up chemicals are acting on you, I've gotten to a point where being hungry isn't even painful anymore, or thirsty,  don't get me wrong, I'm eating a little here and there, and drinking a little water here and there.  But in reality, I've just give up on everything, I don't want anything.",depression
Stuck,"
I got a new job about 7 months ago and started my master’s degree at the same time. I thought my life was going in the right direction, but lately I've felt stuck. The job is stressful because I feel like my boss hates me and I don't know why. It makes working hard. Every day I get up and feel like crap. I get headaches all the time and just feel down again. I don't want to get back on meds because it felt good to lose them, but I'm alone here in this new town/state. I have no friends or family here. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I made a mistake with the move to this state. I wanted to move to a different state, because my home state is getting worse. Life is not what I imagined when I moved here. I don't like this feeling.

Anxiety Making me Depressed/Question Relationship,"Back story about me....I am 33 years old and been in several dead end relationships (One emotionally abusive, an alcoholic, a coke addict, and a few good guys who just weren't right) When I look back on my past I recognize this feeling I am having now in my current relationship but back then I felt I had reason to...I wasn't being teated right, I was being stonewalled, my significant others wouldn't talk through things with me, when i expressed emotion they would run. I feel that in the times the relationships were not ended by me, the rug was ripped out from under me after being told many times they love me. 
Fast forward to today. I have been dating an amazing man for 3 1/2 months. He is my best friend, treats me nicely, talks through things with me and has shown his commitment to me. Everything seemed to have been fine with me until he told me a month ago he loves me. Almost on a weekly basis since then, I have had an emotional breakdown. I started off questioning if I felt the same way and if he was good enough for me since he vapes and drinks more often then I do. I felt guilty veering off my list of what a perfect mate for me is since he didnt check EVERY box. I came into the relationship confident and feeling beautiful. Then my brain moved into questioning if he REALLY loves me and if he will just dump me once the honeymoon phase is over like some other's have. It seems like every little thing that does not go perfectly I am going into full blown panic mode and have tried to break up with him a few times. My thinking has gone from ""this is my person"" to trying to look for every flaw and reason why it wont work out.
Now, my anxiety is derived from feeling like I have started ruining my relationship I have fear he will leave me and I no longer feel worthy of him. I have tried telling him about my anxiety, and it makes me cry and he has so far been supportive and tried to understand. I feel like no one should want to be with someone with anxiety and I don't feel like i am worthy of love because I read all these things that you cant be with someone until you are happy with yourself. The thing is, when I am single I AM happy! I feel so terrible for trying to end things during my panic attacks I feel he doesn't trust me anymore and I feel so guilty for ever making him question my love for him, even though he has never told me he does. He has been somewhat distant this week and it could be my imagination since he is a lawyer and has a lot of work to do, but I woke up this morning and could barely get out of bed. I feel insane because there is NOTHING wrong in my relationship. It is the most perfect, fun, and loving relationship I have ever been in. 
I have always dreamed of the type of relationship and man that would make me feel at ease and loved and I have him now and it seems like a carefree loving relationship is only a dream. I sometimes want to end the relationship just to put myself out of the pain I feel (fight or flight mode) even though I realize I will be in more pain without him. I don't know what to do!
Does anyone have these feelings too?",depression
not doing well. again,"there isn't a solution.  not getting out not exercise.  not .. anything.  things are too much for me.  life is too much for me.  i literally need someone to pick me up off the floor and take care of me for a long time to recover from the cancer of a bad life and depression.  i miss from friends on here.  i'm too tired to keep up with anyone now.  too depressed.  i miss the support and understanding.  i can't seem to take my own life even though i think that would be an enormous relief.  no one deserves to be this unloved and under this much stress.  i can't pick myself up by my own bootstraps.  i try but there's too much.  i feel so tired. every night pray to pass away, to not wake up to face another day of this.  my god, what did i do to deserve so much unhappiness.  i don't think i can work anymore.  all my energy is gone.  all my belief in something better or in something working out is gone.  one hurt and disappointment and stress after another.  i miss some of my friends on here that i used to have but have disappeared.  where are you?  were you only ghosts?  i'm sorry, i am just beyond depressed and tired right now.",depression

Depression  & Anger,"I am new to this group so I hope its ok to ask this: 
Does anyone else out there get angry as well as sad when dealing with depression?
My depression will sometimes express itself as anger or I get really irratated.   I get defensive and lash out at others.  It has cost me some long time ""friends"" recently. I say ""friends"", as they know I have been struggling.  As long time friends(10 plus years)I would hope they understand, but they don't.
I will say they did something pretty crappy, so my reaction wasn't totally wrong-I was very hurt.  It was just pretty intense, and I got very nasty and defensive. I have since reached out to apoligize but I think this friendship is over.  
 I am on medication, have been for about three months. I am feeling 100 percent better, still struggle at times, but better every day. Anger issues really are tied to depression. Does anyone else have this issue?",depression

Job Woes,"I feel really depressed about my promotion, because it's not working out. I have trouble with it and I'm sick of asking questions because then I'm made to feel like I'm stupid. I've made mistakes and this one coworker never ceases to call me out on it. I get that she's pregnant, I get that she's got a swollen head. That doesn't excuse what she says. I want to go back to my old position there or be transferred to a different department, and I told one of the higher-ups that. The problem is, we really need people in the department to which I was transferred. Once one of our major clients withdraws all their clinics from using our services, then it might be easier and I can transfer. That won't be for a few months though, and I don't know if I want to wait that long. I've thought of finding a new job, but it's a bad decision to make right now, for a lot of reasons. First of all, I've job-hopped A TON. I need to stay put for a bit. Secondly, I make $17.90 an hour right now and I have benefits through my company. That's incredibly important. Also, although management sucks in a lot of ways, they appreciate me and my work-- the manager I talked to said she hadn't heard anything negative about my performance so far. Furthermore, if I leave right now, chances are they won't agree to giving me a recommendation, since I would be royally screwing them over by quitting. I went on a job interview on Tuesday, and it didn't seem like it would be any better. In fact, it would be a decrease in pay with no benefits, and the job ddin't match the description on their Indeed posting. So I declined it. Honestly, the best option is to stick it out. But can I do it??????",depression
Abilify,My Dr took me off wellbutrin and put me on abilify. I was doing amazing the first two months. Felt better than ever. Thought everyone should be on this amazing drug!! She started me out on 2 mg pill but wanted  me to start with half a dose then up to a full 2 mg. I am very sensitive to meds so I started on a quarter pill for about 2 weeks then moved up to half and then to a whole. When I had been on the whole for a couple weeks I started having odd dreams and anxiety attacks. I started going back down. I am now on a quarter 2 mg pill and my head is foggy and I have a slight headache a lot of the time. I still get some waves of anxiety but my mind is not clear and I have trouble remembering some things. I will call my dr on Tuesday and talk with her. Just wondering if any others have had these feelings.,depression
TMS,"I'm at my psychiatrist office for my follow up appt after my recent hospitalization. I did TMS a little over a year ago and it helped greatly! I was able to stay out of the hospital for almost a year. 
The Dr. in the hospital reccomended trying it again. So I'm bringing it up to my psychiatrist today. Insurance covered just fine last time so I'm hoping that they will again this time. 
Has anyone on here ever tried TMS before and if so what was your results? Do you think doing it again will help? I'm just miserable and need relief. Transportation will be an issue but God has come through before I know he will again. 
Thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. ",depression
Lost,"My brother committed suicide in May of 2108. I'm still living with my parents (19) and I've been staying at friend's houses for a good two or three weeks. I still come home every day but I go back out every night. The reason why is because my house is too painful to be in. My brother use to sleep the room I sleep in, we have thousands of memories in every inch of this house. I can't stand to be alone here at night without wanting to have a mental break down. Some night is better than others but most of the time it's the same feeling. I just told my parents about it because my dad asked why I needed to keep staying with my friends... They both were quiet and they said that they understood and weren't upset but I can't help to feel like I upset them. I know what I said didn't make them happy and it probably hurt them but I don't want them to think that I don't love them. I told them that too.

Please help me!,"I've posted a similar post in the PTSD page.
I am seeing a new therapist as the last one caused more trauma. I just got out of the hospital. 24 days in an intensive trauma program that specializes in DID. 
It helped a bit. I spent days on the phone with my insurance company trying to find a new therapist. Then I called them and 98% turned me down because they were either full, had a waiting list, or couldn't treat my DID. I was feeling so helpless. Then I called a trauma specialist intern therapist who doesn't take insurance. She works in a sliding scale. We agreed on $35 a session. Which isn't bad at all! 
I'm on disability and I don't bring in that much money, a little over $700 a month. I get paid at the beginning of each month. I've already paid all my bills and extra stuff that I thought at the time I could afford. Which has now left me with no money. But now I've cut off all the subscription service I had so i can afford her next month. 
I feel very hopeless and helpless! I feel like I'm fighting a war all alone! 
I see her three times before I get paid again. I've quit my subscriptions to save money so I can afford her next month. 
I help others at every cost I can regardless of them being able to help me back out or not. 
My family is very unsupportive and toxic. I moved 500 miles away to start my life over and get away from all that toxicity.  
I need help and I don't know who or where else to turn to.  I'm on my knees begging and pleading for your help. I just want to see a therapist. Is that too much to ask? 
I'm really freaking out. My DID system isn't staying calm anymore. My destructive parts are very strong and are being very bad. They are influencing me to hurt myself. It's really hard not to give in.
I also think who cares? Why should a therapist care? I just don't understand why life has to hurt so bad? 
All I want is to see a therapist. Is that too much to ask? 
I'm begging for help with money to pay her. 
Please!!!! My first session is Monday. 
Send me a pm if you want.

Someone Died,"A young woman my age died yesterday. I didn’t even know this person, but I just feel terrible for her family. I had a dream about it last night, and it’s all I could think about today. All I can think about is how her family doesn’t deserve this pain and how their whole situation is so unfair. The other thing I’ve been thinking, the AWFUL thing, is that there’s a part of my mind that is almost jealous of her. I feel terrible for saying that. And it’s really not fair to her. She didn’t take her own life, it was totally unexpected, she had weekend plans, she had big plans for her future, and here I am wishing I was dead. And I really don’t know how to feel about that. I hate that there was a perfectly motivated person, ready to live her life to the fullest, but she was taken away. I hate that I’ve turned her death around and made it all about myself. I hate that she was taken and probably could have done much better things for this world than I can.

Deepest depression I’ve ever been in..need comfort,"Hi everyone. I am so glad I found this. I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life. Recently I got involved in a dangerous group. They were extremely negative, toxic, and anti-medication. It was supposed to be a support group. I was so desperate to belong I threw away my meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) because I was told if I took them I wasn’t sober. Things progressed and the group started to talk badly about my family and I realized they were trying to separate me from my family. I was getting an awful knot in my stomach and knew something was very wrong. It was like a cult. I also felt my depression coming back and knew I needed my meds but felt I couldn’t take them and suicide started to seem like my only way out. I eventually left the group 2 days ago. Since then I was been in one of the deepest darkest depressions of my life. It hurts to breathe or even open my eyes. My mom said take it one second at a time but a second seems like forever when I feel like this. Everyone keeps saying it will pass but it just seems impossible to get through this right now.

Also, I am ALONE at 72 and my adult kids almost NEVER call me. One never does, the other two a couple of times a YEAR!
Started Cymblata Feb 4. So just about a month and I see no difference at all.

What did I do? Did I give up a huge opportunity?,"Hello all, 
I have been in one big mess over the last week or so. I carefully thought everything through but of course it blows up in my face everytime. 
I have been out of work for just short of 2 years now. My last job was in a toxic environment and I was having health problems (still am). I was constantly being threatened with termination for surgeries and absences so my wife and I agreed it was time for me to leave there and work on myself. She is a shift supervisor at a hospital. She makes a great salary and we have been very careful as far as a budget goes. We do not waste money. Also, at the time she was in family nurse practitioner school. 
During my time off, I visited some doctors and took care of the house. My in-laws hate me because in their eyes I’m home sitting on the couch “living the good life” while their daughter works. It’s not true. I do everything I can at home. A rare thing happened in my small town. Some job openings came open that weren’t retail or fast food! I applied. I have felt horrible not financially providing despite being ill. Some interviews later and I ended up with two offers! I have struggled in the past to get one offer much less two. It was a good self esteem boost to see two businesses want me. But then reality hit that I must make a choice. 
It was a Friday and both offers came. Both want me starting Monday. That same Friday, my wife was taking her life changing family nurse practitioner board. Meanwhile I’m in the car waiting for her and trying to figure out what job to take. I literally had just a few hours to decide since both places expected me Monday and both closed Saturday and Sunday. I told them both yes so I could figure out what to take and then turn the other down. My wife gave her advice before going in for her FNP board test. I’m making phone calls from a rainy parking lot to decide what to do. My wife passed her FNP board. What should have been a huge celebration, I ruined it somewhat in being upset/torn over what job to try. 
I made a decision. I chose the one that paid less but offered raises that would eventually surpass the other offer. They are very understanding in needing a day off for sickness or whatever the need. Also, while limited, advancement opportunities are there. Only benefits are paid holidays and one week paid vacation after one year. Any other time missed is unpaid. But I would not like the type of work as much here when compared to the other place. The other place was computer data entry. I would enjoy that more but with time I would beat their offer at the other place and they do give sick/vacation time on each pay period. They also have a reputation of being hard to work for at times too though. I contacted HR saying I was accepting another offer. I chose the less pay but raises/advancements possible but I would not like that kind of work the same as I would have the job I turned down. 
Off to work on Monday and I soon realized I had made a mistake. I thought I would be able to learn the work but it destroyed my anxiety/depression/panic. It’s a medical type job so all paperwork must be perfect or else no pay from insurance. Every item a patient needed had a different way of doing things as far as the paper work, filing, etc. I was also told I would be asked to make at home medical deliveries and I would be “on call” sometimes if I needed to go check on a patient’s equipment at their house at 3am if they were to call. None of that was disclosed to me until they got me in there on day 1. I had applied for a particular office position but I was being floated around everywhere. I applied for a specific office work task, not being on call or watching chaos putting all medical files together. I applied for a certain job and that’s what I should be training on day 1. Not being floated around.
I just couldn’t do it. So I contacted HR of the second job to see if that job was still open. They never got back to me. I guess they’re mad and I burned a bridge.
I resigned from the position. It broke my heart because I wanted so bad to be helpful financially in my household despite still being sick. But as it turns out, I should have never applied for either because since my wife is now an  FNP, a move is now likely. When resigning, the boss said she had plans in mind for me to maybe take over for her because she wanted to retire and I could make big bucks. I almost asked for my resignation letter back. I would have tried to drive from our new home if I had known. Or was I being manipulated in trying to stay? After all, I was never told anything about being “on call” and being floated all over the office never even seeing the job that I applied for. One particular lady was in billing but when the front desk clerk quit a couple weeks ago, the boss pulled her from billing to work the desk. It’s expected she will stay at the desk because she was told she had a friendly caring attitude and could answer all patient questions. I don’t know what her job title was but if it was billing, I would be mad. If she applied for billing then that is where she should be! I was not aware that just because you had a job title, doesn’t mean that’s what you’ll do. They’d throw you anywhere. It was too much for my anxiety/depression/panic. I couldn’t do it. 
I feel like a worthless piece of garbage. Did I potentially lose an opportunity that with time I could have been the boss or was that manipulation? I find it hard to believe I would be picked over two particular people that had been there for years and knew everything even though I have a Bachelors Degree and from my understanding they didn’t. The boss is such a nice lady though. I guess I should have picked the other job? They did not return my call so not only did I perhaps burn a big opportunity with resigning but I also may have burned a bridge with not receiving a response back from the second job. 
I cant tell you how upset I am. All I’ve thought about is how useless I am that my wife has had to take care of me financially and my poor Dad comes running to me when I have a stomach flare up (Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohns Disease) or need surgery for a kidney stones. I’m a nuisance to him and to everybody. I can’t do anything for myself. When I do get an opportunity, it blows up in front of my face like this did. I wish I was six feet under so my wife would find somebody better than me so she could have a happier life, I wouldn’t be a bother to my Dad any longer, no more pain from illnesses and doctors appointments, no more worrying about wanting to work and finding opportunities that I end up ruining, etc etc etc  
I guess I should not have applied for either knowing my wife was about to take her FNP board and we would potentially have to move for offers for her. I should have waited it out to see what the future holds for her and then try to apply for positions. But a rare thing happened in that opportunities for me came open in my little town and I jumped for them when I shouldn’t have. Now I’ve lost them both, probably burned some bridges, and feel like absolute garbage. 
Your thoughts and prayers are appreciated.

Depression vs Bad Parenting,"Hello everyone. I am fairly new to DS. I have been looking around wondering where to post the things I need insight on.
Currently, very recently within the last couple of weeks I have been placed on an antidepressant. It is the second time in my life. It is probably the third time I feel deep into feeling as though everything is pointless and my contributions in life are are probably causing more problems then good.
Recently my son was invited to a friends house along with parents. My son for lack of a better description is proving to be like me in the department of self worth. We have none. 
He sent a friend a message through social media expressing his feelings of worthlessness. At this parents house, (I am assuming this parent knows about my sons message. I believe it was them that made everyone aware.) Also, know I am not upset with this person, I am glad they shared this information. Anyways, we sat there and this parent went on and on about how other children may not have parents that give them confidence. Tell them they are smart and good looking and all the positive things you would tell a child to boost their self esteem.
I am crushed, because I this person knows how my child is feeling and this parent is assuming that I or we do not boost my sons self esteem. Like, I haven’t already been beating myself up about being a horrible parent. Like I haven’t already tried to reach out to him and help him. Like I don’t tell him he is smart, funny, handsome, amazing, and how his personality is one of the best I have ever known. As if I never told him to pay more attention to adults compliments then kids his own age. And how sometimes you may not fit into your environment but eventually you will be one of those people everyone wants to be around. And how hard sometimes it is to wait for that. To be friends with people who lift him up and not be around those who make him feel bad.
Now, after all of this I have to worry that not only do I already feel like the worst parent in the world, but now I can’t look people in the face because they think I’m the worst parent in the world. I don’t pretend that I am a perfect parent, is there such a thing?
Thank you for your time.",depression
Need support,"I don't understand myself... I'm really trying to stay positive and motivated but then I make choices that make my depression worse.
Background... I've dealt with depression since age 14.. started on meds when I was 28.  Im 44 now. Tried different meds, the most current works to an extent but makes me so tired and the stomach aches..ugh so I haven't taken it in a week.
I decided I needed a leave from work because of multiple reasons but short story, new owners, new leadership, new boss is a VP and put me down almost always...never met anyone like her. I gave it a full year with new manager and she really affected me.  
Dating..I did not date for 4 years so I can focus on ME and I have no regrets. I was making bad decisions with the men I dated. Fast forward to today... Met someone in November..fell for him hard..bad decision because he is a true narcissistic person.  I let go once and he pulled me back in.
My focus was so good without him in my life, my heart, and my head.  Today I'm so depressed and I have a lot going for me.  He's not worth my time so why do I do this to myself? I break my own heart ",depression
Funny...not so funny story,"My husband finds it funny, but me not so much. So my husband is in the hospital right now, he got admitted yesterday for either a blood clot or a PE. However that is not the funny story.
Here is what happened. My 2 year old son wanted to sleep in bed with me last night, and normally we don't co-sleep, however given that he was missing his daddy, I allowed him to sleep with me. He didn't nap much yesterday and I wasn't feeling my greatest so we went to bed pretty early, well he woke up in the middle of the night, I tried to put him in bed, but he wasn't having it at all, so I let him back in my bed.
Now my son is 2 as I stated and I'll be 30 in a few months so my husband and I have decided to start trying for another baby. About two weeks ago we bought a different kind of lube, to spice things up, we tried it and it burned me so bad that we have not used it again, I thought my husband threw it away since I had no intention of ever using it again, however he just put it on his nightstand. 
Well my 2 year old thought he would get into it in the middle of night and spread it all over the bedspread, I woke up to a burning sensation all over my legs and my arms. It burned so bad. At 1st I didn't understand what was happening, and then it dawned on me what had happened. The two of us took a nap at 3am this morning. 
I just got off the phone with my husband and he thought it was hilarious. I not so much!
I am on muscle relaxers right now for my back, and I take sleeping pills to sleep, so I fell asleep shortly after putting him back in my bed. I put on the Disney flash-drive and gave him his sippy cup and figured he would fall asleep shortly....NOT.

First step in the right direction,Yesterday was my first check-up in the last seven months and one thing I hate is the doctors. As those of you don't know I lost my little sister recently and I haven't fully been my-self. Its not easy lossing a loved one but even before my sisters passing i've battled with depression and inner demons. Anyways when i went this appointment I was down and the whole time i thought of my sister holding my hand and telling me that she would be right there next to me. Thank god i didnt have to get any shots. But i made an effort to seek help and ask my doctor to reffer me to a therapistt to talk to.,depression
Unsure,"I sit at home when Im not at work and think about things. I can not help but think about how I have screwed up. I have screwed up my daughters life but taking her away from her dad and people we knew. I dont talk to ANY one. I screwed up my ex husbands life because i filed for diovrce, moved on from him and moved away. I have scred up my new relationship. I feel so down all the time. That some days i dont have any idea on what to do. I am so tired all the time. ",depression
Abusive ex-husband,"I was married to my first husband for 11 years.  He was physically, sexually and mentally abusive towards me.  I divorced him 21 years ago.  I had a protection order and was granted sole, legal, physical custody of our 2 children.  It was that bad.  I closed that chapter of my life a long time ago - or so I thought.  My kids saw some things but didn't know everything and I shielded them from a lot of the ugly details.
Fast forward to almost 3 years ago and my adult children reunited with their father.  I was leary about this reunion but it's not my choice, my children are adults and it's ultimately up to them if they want to have a relationship with their father.  People can change, or so I assumed.  Then, recently, things got very bad.
My 30 yr old son recently had a breakdown and was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.  He lost his job, he's in extreme debt, he lives in another state far away from family, his girlfriend broke up with him and he's afraid another woman might be pregnant with his baby.  His breakdown was leading up for months and everyone in our family was worried about him.  He voluntarily committed himself and they kept him there for 72 hours.  My son called me and begged me to get him out of there.  There was nothing I could do and even if I could, I felt he was getting good evaluation & care there.  He called his dad, his dad convinced him it was my fault that he's depressed, my fault he's in a hospital, my fault that his life isn't working out for him. 
My son got out of the hospital, called me and was extremely infuriated.  My son said he talked to his dad who told him ""every detail of his side of the story"" and that ""dad divorced you because you're crazy, abusive and manipulative"".  Complete projection.  In fact, I dug through all my paper work, found all the police reports, hospital records, protection order and the divorce I filed.  I want to share this paperwork with my son but haven't because 1) he's no longer talking to me and 2) I don't want to upset his already fragile psychological state and/or appear like I'm manipulating him.
My ex-husband called my house twice one night, I'm assuming he got my phone number from my son.  The 2nd time he called, I told him never to call my house again.  He then called my elderly mother and said he was taking care of his son now and that I'm no longer in contact with my son. 
I feel like my ex-husband is abusing me all over again and using our mentally ill son to do this.  I thought I ended this abusive relationship forever, never would have imainged it would come back again in my life.  I'm absolutely devestated.  I've been very depressed.  
Has anyone else here had to deal with an abusive ex-husband years after divorce?  I don't know what to do to get through my son.  I'm heartbroken right now.",depression
Alt.support.depression,"I've been feeling down most of my life. Feelings of loneliness always accompany it.  Yesterday, I started reminiscing and missing the ASD community on usenet. Most of the old posts have disappeared.  Anyway, it brought me back to darkest moments of my life, but without the support I may not be around.  Any ASDers around? Any places I can chat with others. I recall using IRC back in the day.",depression
A Lot,"There's a lot going through my head right now. We found out a few weeks ago that my 96-year-old grandma has cancer. She has a lesion on her calf that she says has always been there, but lately it has been bleeding without her touching it, picking at it, etc. The biopsy confirmed that it's a melanoma. She has decided against chemo, and anyway they still need to determine the extent to which it may have spread. Basically, we still don't know enough yet. She is actually doing pretty well-- she's been on Tylenol #3, which has helped with her pain considerably. The doctor is considering immunotherapy rather than chemotherapy, but like I said, we don't have enoough information yet for her to make a decision regarding her treatment. It's just a hard diagnosis for me to accept. My gran's a pretty tough woman, so part of me is hopeful. At the same time, she has told me that if it came down to it, she's ready to die. And that is hard to hear, because when I was growing up, she was like my second mother. I realize that she's 96, and she has lived an amazing life with no regrets. She's fine, I'm not. I've also decided that my new job is not a great fit for me. It's not terrible, but I don't really like sitting at a desk all day typing in prescriptions. I feel empty and unfulfilled. A lot of eople have been quitting at my job lately. I don't want to quit necessarily, but since this was a promotion and the only other position available is for sterile compounding (which is something in which I'm not certified), I don't know where else I could go in the company. I feel depressed because I've lost my path. I feel like I have no purpose. The medical field is fascinating to me in a sense, and I want to help people, but there are definitely some aspects of it that I don't like. But what else would I do? I've worked in pharmacy for the past few years. I don't know what else to do with my life. I'm looking into options to volunteer, so hopefully that will help. I've been out with a nice guy a few times, and I've been to a really great park in my new area, so I'm (very slowly) getting used to my new area. Being sick all week has not helped either. I just wish I had direction. Like I said, a lot has been on my mind.",depression
Sleeping pills,"Having a super bad day...
Thinking about taking some sleeping pills to sleep forever :( Only thing is my son is here and he's too young to know what to do if I did. So it's like I'm stuck in this misery :( I have counseling in 4 days but I don't think I can make it. Just so tired of being tired;Like the only way for me to have peace is end it all....",depression
Feeling alone,"Moved away from everything and everyone I knew for a fresh start after Ex husband kicked me and our daughter out. Now I feel all alone. Noone from my life has reached out in about 2 months to check on me. See how Im doing or anything, I thought I knew these people but nothing. Starting my new life I thought I would atleast have my best friend by my side but she has forgotten about me. It seems like everyone has forgotten about me. I guess Im just forgettable. ",depression
I'm not enough,"No matter how hard I try I'm not ok. Like what I'm doing isn't enough. I fight to keep a smile on my face even though I'm in physical pain every day. I try to keep a handle on my emotions even though I have actual damage to my brain preventing me from doing so. I say I'm ok because no one wants to hear about how bad it is. I'm not ok and everything is saying it's not allowed. I get disappointed when a really good date cancels plans for a second date. I'm too disappointed, I can't let it get to me. Do you know how fucking hard it is to date now? My life has been shattered and I've had to piece it back together. I've had to put me back together. I saved the energy to be ok on the date. I was honest and stragihtforward. I let myself be vulnerable even though I'm more fragile now. But no, it's not enough. Maybe it's not the right guy but I'm fucking allowed to be disappointed. I want love, a family, I want my happy ending after all this hell. I fight. I fight all the time to keep going. I fight for that future I dream of having. My emotions are on a hair pin trigger now. And I can't control it. Do you get that kind of torture? Knowing you're not who you used to be anymore. Knowing you're overreacting but you can't do anything. Not only does my body have limitations but so does my mind. And it just feels like everything, everyone, is telling me to do more, to be more because this isn't enough. What if I don't have anything else? What if this is the best it gets? It's been three years. No one else has really mentioned the anniversary. But lucky me I get to have a contstant reminder. I get to be in more pain, more emotional. I just want someone to tell me it's ok that I'm not ok. It's ok that I can't control the effects of the damage. Let me be enough. I already know I'm not who I used to be, I don't anyone else to remind me.",depression
Roomate issues,"Hi I'm fairly new here.  I'm getting pretty unhappy with a woman I'm helping live with me temporarily.  I just need to vent.  I'm trying to cope with her, but I  feel I have to stay in my room most of the time to deal with her.  One of the issues is she talks a lot.  Sometimes it's okay I can deal with it and other times I'm being too polite.  I guess I need to find some kind of balance with her.",depression
I Don’t understand what’s happening,"i have never felt more alone in my life. I have always battled with depression and in general secluding myself from the people that love me. I feel unloveable, and the one person who was supposed to make me feel safe, loved, and comfortable is doing the complete opposite. I feel so alone in my marriage. My husband is so degrading to me, says things that he knows will hurt my feeling, and very clearly states that he doesn’t care because I need to hear it. According to him, nobody is ever straight with me. At the end of my 2 year military career he told me that I have accomplished nothing and that I am going out worse than I came in. He is unsupportive. I feel like I can’t express my feelings to him because he always has a reason to yell at me for it, telling me I’m wrong. I’ve been thinking more and more lately that the world may be better without me around. That maybe if I wasn’t here he may understand my value, even though I don’t even underhand what that value is. Apparently none if I’m not even worth it of being given love from someone. True unconditional love. This hurts so much. ",depression
I'm just so off today,"So lately I have struggled with myself to be more social at work, to try to socialize with others more.  I often feel like I'm laughed at behind my back, as the younger people will pass glances at each other alot when I speak or do anything that people might notice.  Today I just can't take it.  I emotionally feel as if I have been sliced up by thousands of razor blades, and just sitting around naked, wounds oozing blood and burning with every wind blowing my way.  With my dad being sick, in the hospital, and facing the fact that he doesn't have much more time where he will be able to even go to the bathroom on his own, my mom's mental health declining, I know she is depressed, but she will never reach out for help.  and today, I don't know if I could even give it.  I just feel like I need a large bottle of vodka or whiskey. I really just want to run away from everyone here at work, and at home.  I want to hide and not come out until I feel better.  I don't have that luxury as I have to work  no matter what.  I feel old, ugly and gross to top it off.  ",depression
This week sucks.,This is hard for me because I'm use to just shutting down and isolating myself. But I am trying to fix myself so I figured why not post something here. This week has been shit for me. Starting Sunday I just felt off. The bad thoughts have been coming back. Every day it's been coming stronger and I'm starting to wonder why I'm fighting it. I should just leave the people in my life alone. I'm just weak. I want to help people and be a good friend yet my presence seems to annoy people. I would harm myself either cutting or punching a wall but I promised someone I wouldn't do that anymore. They were my releases now that I don't have them I don't know what to do. ,depression

updating,"So I don't have as much time I would like to come here and post and reply, and try to help people.  My job is really demanding right now,  that's not necessarily a bad thing,  sometimes I do good in that sort of environment.  I was really depressed to the point that I was just completely zoned out all day yesterday and day before.  My dad got sick again this past weekend with pnuemonia and had to be placed in ICU for a day or 2, and is now in regular room in the hospital, on his way to recovery.  
The way have tried to help myself so far, was when I went home yesterday, I did a little extra self care, with my skin, I packed my gym bag and got up the this morning,  listened to some motivational talks on you tube, and went to the gym before coming to work.  so today I am TRYING to focus, and TRYING to get things done, which is much better than the past few days.  I hope I can continue to TRY,  you know, cause the harder I TRY, the better I will perform.  I wish you all luck in trying to get out of this mess we live in, and hope you can find a light,  if the light is just that you are trying today.  It helps me to have a place like this to come too when I need it.",depression
Depression gets worse at school,"When I am at school, my depression is so much worse. I am alone for most of the day. I mean there are lots of people at my school and in my classes but none of my friends are in my classes.
I can deal with being alone but the main thing is that I get bullied at school. I have gone to the school counselor a few times about it but it happens in the halls and I'm always being called names by people I don't even know. All I can really do is keep my head down and pray to God that nobody calls me fat or ugly again.
Another thing is that there is so much pressure being put on me by some of my teachers and it stresses me out so much. They expect so much from me and I can't give what they expect. 
I am at the point where in my dreams, all I can hear are these voices telling me and that fat and ugly and that I should just die. Sometimes when I am walking in the hall, I pay attention to any and every little whisper and giggle, praying that they aren't whispering and giggling about me.  ",depression
Angry,"I don't know what's wrong with me, but for the past 3 days I've been mad as a bull. I'm scared I might lash out and punch someone in the face. It might be connected to the fact that I've been sick for a week, but I'm scaring myself.",depression
Feeling like I'm hard to love,"I haven't posted in a while but today has been really shitty and I need some gentle hugs..
So much is out of my control and I just have to sit and wait and hope it all turns out. But I'm waiting alone. My friends and family are supportive of course but sometimes I feel like I have to remind them to care or understand that I'm not really ok. I've been in multiple arguments and fights with my friends because I've been snappy or too sensitive. But that's part of my injury, how do I fix that? I want to tell them ""hey I'm still a broken mess over here and I need you to see that"". I feel like things have gotten better, like things aren't as bad or heavy but then I have times like now where everything feels so fucking hard. When will things get easier? In three weeks it will be the three year anniversary of the accident and it feels like it just happened yesterday but then it also feels like it's been a lifetime. Everyone has moved on and has their own lives to worry about while I'm stuck waiting to know what my future will be. I want to scream but I don't blame them, it just reminds me how alone I really am. ",depression
Distraught over social justice discourse,"Hey, there. I really could use some support. I feel so alone, as I feel rejected by both ""SJWs"" and ""anti-SJWs"". Now, I know the term ""SJW"" is generally used as a pejorative - but I'm using the term for the sake of simplicity. You see, I started getting involved in feminism and social justice back in 2011. Then I had joined Tumblr in January of 2012. For the first few years, I was very active in social justice - until I was, essentially, ex-communicated bu December of 2015.Please pardon the length, but I need someone to hear me out and understand where I'm coming from.~~~~~1. I first started getting interested in feminism at some point in 2011 - and, via the concept of intersectionality, I’ve gotten into social justice in general. I’ve also taken up causes for fat acceptance and neurodiversity acceptance. I still support the basic tenets of all three causes.2. One thing I should clarify on the “fat acceptance” one is that I do *not* make any claims over fat being healthy or weight being unimportant. I simply believe that people should not be bullied, harassed, or taunted on the basis on their weight. Nothing more, nothing less.3. One common thread between feminism, fat acceptance, and neurodiversity acceptance is the belief that people should not be condemned or punished for certain behaviours that harm nobody else. In other words, it jibes quite well with my believe on the “harm principle” and being anti-authoritarian.4. So then, when the issue of “cultural appropriation” came up, that did *not* jibe with my anti-authoritarian views. I kept quiet about it for a long time, though. That maybe should’ve clued me in that I was starting to get involved in a toxic community, particularly that I felt I had to keep quiet about my own views on that issue. However, I did not see any suitable alternative for me. The anti-SJWs sure the hell didn’t appear to be a good alternative - considering that they had already seen to taunt me on a few occasions, at that point in time.5. At some point, I’ve started to see more and more cases of people being bullied or harassed in the name of “social justice”. I’ve seen instances such as as when white people with dreadlocks or white people wearing kimonos would get harassed in the name of “social justice”. Or when others taunt white people for their perceived dietary preferences, and use “social justice” as their pretext for doing so. So, yes, I have many issues with “SJWs”. Or “toxic activists”, they should be called. If anyone who were themselves part of the social justice community called out such behaviours, I haven’t seen it. Some have actually defended such behaviours - while others have kept quiet about it, perhaps for the same reasons as I did. I, for one, feared retribution from the toxic aspects of the social justice community.6. Per #5, it didn’t exactly help when it seemed as if the only people who were willing to call out abuses in the name of “social justice” were from anti-SJWs - many of who seemed to be just as likely to be in the “SJWs are crybabies” or “SJWs are idiots” camps, as in the “SJWs are bullies” camp. So I wasn’t exactly presented with a good alternative, and I greatly feared being associated with the “SJWs are crybabies” and/or “SJWs are idiots” camps simply for daring to speak out against abusive behaviour done in the name of “social justice”.7. So that it distresses me greatly that seem to be very few SJW critics who are *exclusively* in the “SJWs are bullies” camp, while vocally rejecting the “SJWs are crybabies” and “SJWs are idiots” camps. I seem to be the only one doing that, and it is hard for me for find like-minded folks. That is the source of my frustration.8. So, on that note, whenever an anti-SJW criticizes abusive behaviour that is done in the name of “social justice” - how can I be certain that said anti-SJW falls *only* in the “SJWs are bullies” camp, while having no use for the “SJWs are crybabies” or “SJWs are idiots” camps? That is my problem here.9. So the problem I have with anti-SJWs is that so many think I’m being overly-sensitive about being female, physically disabled, and neurodivergent - in the same exact way that SJWs think that I’m being overly-sensitive about being white. So the problem I have is with finding a community who will accept me for being female, physically disabled, neurodivergent, *and* white. Do, as such, I feel rejected by both SJWs and anti-SJWs.~~~~~Why don’t more people criticize SJWs *only* for being bullies?Why don’t more people criticize SJWs strictly for issues such as the following? Harassing white people for “cultural appropriation”. Feeling the need to ruthlessly taunt white people. Being dismissive of the issues and feelings of white people. Harassing fan artists such as zamii007 for “problematic” fan art. Downplaying the atrocity of the four black people kidnapping and torturing a disabled white man for days in Chicago. Thinking it’s appropriate behaviour for grown ass adults to spew hatred on *kids* such as Keaton Jones.In summation, I really wish more people would criticize SJWs *only* for issues such as these. Cases where SJWs revel in hurting other people.Do you realize that you dilute the whole cause when you feel the need to throw in BULLSHIT criticisms about SJWs being “crybabies” or “idiots”?!When you feel the need to ruthlessly taunt SJWs for things such as “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings”, then you are being EVERY BIT AS NASTY AND REPULSIVE as the SJWs who feel the need to ruthlessly taunt white people!!I *WISH* SJWs WERE CRYBABIES INSTEAD OF BULLIES!!~~~~~TL;DR: As I'm at odds with both ""SJWs"" and ""anti-SJWs"", I feel as if I really have no place to turn - except for this forum, hopefully. So that's that. Thanks for letting me rant.",depression
I am not ok,"Please note that the following is just an array of my thoughts that I am feeling. And that all of my feeling are all over the place. 
I am not ok.
I walk around pretending, pushing, hiding all of these emotions that I feel to the side so that I can cater to everybody else's feelings. I dont know how else to deal with it. I don't know how else to react. When I feel a certain way and I try to voice it, it seems to go in one ear and out the other and when I dont voice it that's when everyone gets worried when I choose to not say anything and watch myself self destruct that's when everyone seems to take notice when I'm dealing with it the best way that i can. I dont know. that's all I can say is I dont know. ",depression
Its not easy,"Well first I want to give a big thanks to those who wrote on my previous post about me not being ok. Saturday was not a good day for me and I haven't really had one in a while, so Thank you for being there and supporting me through what I was going through. And secondly I can say that I am definitly having a better day, well morning it is only like 4am. Um it hasn't been easy for me, I haven't had the best life but it also hasn't nessicarly been the worst. I mean the last 15 years of my life weren't horrible, I had one of my best friend by my side. For those of you who don't know and are new to this group or to reading my post, I lost my 15 year old sister, A.K.A my best friend, to undetected heart condition. Its been about 7 almost 8 months since her passing and i would have to say that throughout my famliy, which includes my mom, my 6 year old sister, my 3 year old sister, my step dad, my 12 year old step sister, my step mom, and my dad, I am the one who I feel is taking it the hardest. Although we have gotten closure about what had happen to my sister, I dont think that i am nessicarly ready to let go. It hurts waking up every morning and not being able to mess around with her or walk her to the bus stop and tell her to have a good day. I have definitly have had my ups and downs with my mental health before but I don't think that I will ever recover from this. I know that they say that it takes time and in time it gets better but i don't know. I hurt everyday that i wake up and pray to god that he reverses it and takes my life instead of hers but then i am brought back to reality and reminded that its real it happened and i can't change it and i have to live with it now. ",depression
Writing back again ...,"Hi, y'all. I am back writing here. It's been a while but I felt led to come back here. 
Good morning. I am here because I've been having a hard time adjusting to the changes going on in my life. 
Let me update ya who know me on dailystrength: I was working in the field of security for over three and 1/2 years. I did Auxiliary Police for over three years. I transitioned into the field of social work starting at a non-profit organization that helps individuals with developmental disabilities. I loved that. I then went into the health care of health homes in a clinic in the South Bronx. It was a learning experience. Worth it but i loved the idea of helping people with everyday life issues. So I am now at Good Shepherd Services as a care coordinator for children and families. I see myself working here. 
I am now in the midst of searching for my own apartment, primarily studio since it's just me. I really don't mind living with a roommate but I want my own space. I can't stand to share a bathroom with strangers I don't know. My family home life is pretty much stale. My parents are everything. but the home atmosphere is dead. I live with my brother, whom I've had history with but his lifestyle don't match with mine and iI just disagree with. 
I am in the journey of recreating a life that is mine and separate from my blood family. My parents lean on me as their rock and their proud child. I don't want to be needed by them. I want to live for me and do what's good, healthy, and just. They will still be around and I'll still need them but away from me. I am learning my identity as a person, woman, and child of God. I am immersing myself in the community and I LOVE THAT SHIT!  It feels home to me. But, for my depression, I feel very depressed, disconnected and alone in my parent's place. It drags with me throughout the day. I am overthinking every decision and choice, though I know I am making the right thing. I'd like to hear from ya... ",depression

about to be divorced after 24 years,"This is hard for me cause ive never posted but, you gotta start somewhere. Earlier this month my husband of (just shy) 24 years asked me for a divorse, he said he was sick of tring to make the marrige part of us work that as friends I was an awsome and increadable person. He needs more in a ""parner"" he is looking for hus and cuddles and of course intamitcy (sex to me) I don't care for sex, never brought that up to him to he asked for the divorce. I thought I had that in check but, i started to feel worse about it and it was not very fair to him but, i took for granted he loved me and would not leave me. I guess I was wrong. We are still living in the same house and will for a while (can anyone say unhealthy) I love him so much. I need to try to accept this. Its very hard! ",depression
Mental Breakdowns,"Don't you just love a classic breakdown. Yeah, I sure do. After the lat few weeks of my life I don't even know what I'm doing with my life.

First you lose it in one class. And before you know it is all your classes. I don't know how to stop. I want everything to slow down just long enough for me to catch up. I can't.. I just can't. People around me are getting closer to knowing the real me...the problems, the baggage, the history, the secrets. So I stay alone and I can't handle it but I continue isolating myself. That can't happen. It just can't. I don't know what to do and I hate that. I want advice and I desprately need it...anything. I hate that I don't know what to do and that I need help but I do.

Depression and Anger,"Ive never noticed how much I complain and how angry I am a majority of the time. This isn’t who I am. I’m a lucky person? Right? So what gives me the right to be so negative all the time? I find myself saying (too often) “what did I do to deserve this?” Perhaps I actually did do something. Is this karma? I have so many questions. I was recently in a DV incident in which my life has been turned upside down. I find myself going through an array of emotions. Most prevalent: anger. However, loneliness, sadness, confusion, restlessness, anxiety and are present as well. I’ve been trying to focus on the positives and keep myself “busy” but I feel as though no matter what I do, I screw things up. I get to the point where I ask myself “ Why even try? You’ll screw this up anyways”. I feel like I’ve been neglecting myself so much, that I have lost all faith in ever being genuinely happy. Most people think I have it made, and that I’m such a cheerful happy person. But deep down, on nights like tonight, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Writing is the only thing I can seem to do to feel okay, besides devouring myself into work and helping others. I guess I just want to know that I’m not alone, not crazy and that this is “normal” behavior in response to all the stress I’m under. Thanks for reading ❤️ Any input or conversation is more than welcome. Hope y’all are hanging in there. Xo ",depression
stank,"I don't know where to start.  my daughter is 21, almost 22,  wonderful person, now in a relationship, which appears to be ok,  I'm still single, I did like someone for a minute, but that didn't work out, and I've just always been fine without a relationship, it's just that there is WAAAY more drama from trying to have a romantic relationship tome, then it's worth, even for a good one.  so I'm just pbbbbtht! right now.  I don't feel well physically either, my daughter is about to graduate college, she moved back in for the senior year, but I don't see her much, she's busy and is doing what she is supposed to be doing.  meanwhile I'm asking myself ""what now?"" cause for 22 years, it was all about taking care of my child, who is no longer a child, so it was my excuse for not dealing with the dating world, and it kept me busy.  I didn't mind being single till I met someone I liked,  and now it's just ....????? what am I supposed to do now?

Tough Day,"I'm having a really hard day today. 
Everyday I wake up hopeful and optimistic but lately it seems like the universe throws me something new to deal with every day. I try to push through and keep going even though I don't want too, but today everything became so overwhelming. 
What makes it harder is being a mom - my son is too young to comprehend what depression is let alone what it does to a person. Simple mothering tasks are especially hard today, but I have to push on for him. He is my motivation. 
My marriage is toxic. My husband is insincere about my illness. He becomes angry at me when I have bad days. He honestly makes me feel worse which is very hurtful because a spouse is supposed to love and support you. 
I want to remind you all that what you are dealing with is not ""imaginary"". Your emotions are real and you have every right to feel them. Please do not believe anyone who says you are being overly sensitive or dramatic. Depression is a real illness and it is very real.
I am happy to have you all here who understands. ",depression
Running out of strength,"Like so many others, I have a laundry list of complaints. I guess what’s really frustrating is that, though I have so many answers, I don’t seem to have the right ones. One of my biggest problems is that I have no one to talk to, no one who can listen or hold the space. My therapist couldn’t meet with me again this week, one of my few cherished sources of emotional support. But even with that in my life, I feel far too alone.
Depression really sucks. I guess where I’m lucky is that mine could be so much worse than it is. But it could also be so much better. Everything feels like a challenge, like wading through water on an empty gas tank. Desperate for relief, I started medication last week and it did not go well at all. And with my genetic testing in hand, steering me clear of land mine interactions, it was supposed to go well. Instead, I was deathly ill for 4 straight days. No relief.
It’s so hard to hold onto strength when things refuse to get easier. I try to hang on, search for guidance, but it's getting harder all the time.       ",depression
severe insomnia,"I've had severe insomnia for years.  I'm not sure if it goes with mood disorders...well it probably does.  It seems like the real insomnia started when I got hypothyroidism.  My weight is now stabilized and I've been taking levythyroxine for many years but it seems like my sleep has never been the same.  It's gotten better.  I used to not be able to go to sleep at all.  I go to sleep now...but I usually wake up after three hours...no exceptions.  
Interestingly enough.  I've been taking topomax for migraines and it's been working remarkably well for the migraines.  I had to cut down on the Seroquel because taking seroquel with topomax was just way too much.  The topomax really helps with mood and anxiety as well.  All I can take of seroquel is 25 mg.  I thought I would just try to take the topomax just by itself for sleep but it's not working...I can fall asleep...but I still wake up after three hours.  I woke up the other night and tried to go back to sleep without taking the seroquel but it just didn't work.  I stayed up and read on my phone but just couldn't get back to sleep, so I took the 25 mg seroquel and finally did get back to sleep.  I'm not sure why this is. Not sure what the problem is.  It's a pretty small dose, probably the minimum, but it does help me to stay asleep.  My neurologist won't give me a sleep study, I guess they only do that if they think you have sleep apena.  I wonder if somwhere else they would do a sleep study or if it would even help. It's driving me nuts. Not taking even just that one dose of seroquel just blew the entire day yesterday.  I was so exhausted I could not even function.  And it's not even depression it's the insomnia.  ",depression

Being Pulled in Different Directions,"First off, let me say that this may be all in my head. Nobody is TELLING me I have to do specific things and have specific things. But I feel pressured all the same-- ever since I turned 33 on Friday, I've been feeling like the clock is ticking. My dad, with whom I've always had more of a connection than my mom, made a comment on my birthday about ""the next generation,"" following it up by saying he couldn't do anything about that and would just have to wait while he gets older and older. It was fairly clear that he meant grandchildren. And I love my dad a ton-- I know he didn't mean anything by it exactly. Because he rarely thinks before he speaks lol; he frequently just says things and doesn't consider how they'll sound. But it really got to me because I do want to have kids. But dating hasn't gone well lately, and I would never marry someone just to start a family when I didn't really love that person. That wouldn't be fair to anyone. I feel like I have to get married and have kids NOW. Like I HAVE to have a ton of friends. Like I HAVE to work out. And to be fair, I want to have some of those things. I'd like a better social life. I'm working on establishing an exercise routine. But there are so many things I want to do that I feel I can't do all at the same time. Because I AM an introvert. I NEED time to recharge freon my hellish job. That includes recharging from dealing with people. And I want pets. But I can't take care of a pet AND be out socializing all the time AND working AND dating AND exercising. I've strongly considered quitting my job and finding a work-from-home job, because I'm genuinely unhappy the. But I have benefits through my job, and I NEED to be able to afford my meds.

Help,"Hello, 
I need some advice. I feel as though I am to my limit of having to deal with stuff over and over again. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder and no matter what I try to be strong and keep my feelings inside, but my counselor says I need to say how I feel; because I currently live with my parents and they took in my brothers 4 children so they wouldn't have to go to foster care. And I have been helping to take care of them since I was 10 and now I'm 27, but I have kept my feelings in and not said a word especially since my sister's baby is going to be passing away. So, I've been worried about telling my mom because I feel like she will think I'm being selfish or being a bitch. Anyway, I told my mom this morning about how I can't do it anymore because of my mental health and feel like I'm going to crack and can't do it anymore and her answer was do you know what she has on her shoulders and she's going to crack. And I also should think of someone outside of myself and think about what my sister and brother-in-law are going through. So, she asked me what would I like her to do and all I want is for her to listen and understand me and not judge me and know that my mental and physical health is important; because my counselor has told me over and over again I'm not being selfish and I need to put myself first for the sake of my mental and physical health, since more stressed I get my anxiety and eating disorder get worse. But, I understand how I can get her to see and understand that. Any thoughts or suggestions",depression

How do I help myself,"I am 20 years old and have felt numb for as long as i can remember. I feel numb and like nothing is real, sometimes i wonder if i was to kill myself if i would really die or just wake up. Some days it starts with a slight sadness and builds up intil i cant get out of bed and i eventually go numb and dont feel sad anymore. It has become hard for me to love my girlfriend of 3 years as well. She is my first love and i want to let her go so my sad feelings wont affect her anymore. There are times where i get so numb i dont even care about her but i never break up with her because i know ill regret it later. Im just confused as to why my brain is like this and i want to fix it so bad. Ive done countless hours of research and have found that i may have depersonalization but have found no cure after years of trying to get better. If anything its only getting worse and its only a matter of time before ive had enough.",depression

And yeah I've been through the stages of being depressed before but never like this never to this extent... and I know it somewhat sounds selfish but I wish I wasn't here. I wish it was me in that casket seven eight months ago dreaming forever and not suffering so she could live so she could see all the wonderful things in life she so she could experience having a boyfriend going to prom help taking care of our younger siblings. But now I suffer even more at the thought of what could have been and what should have been. Today was Febuary 14, 2019, a day of love, joy and acceptance, and she was not her to witness it. We share 4 younger siblings and the two who live with me told my mom today that they wished buddy was here and that they were sad because it was the first valentines day with out her... my heartbreaks ever time I think of her everytime I hear her name. My mom looks at us and tells us that that there will be alot of frist with out her, and in the back of my head all I can think of is all of the things that we have done with out her and there is always this little voice in the back of my head saying this is not fair life is not fair.",depression
Hitting Me Hard,"I am seriously struggling with depression these days-- I'm not adjusting well to my new location (even though I love my condo) or my new job. Everyone's telling me I'm doing a great job at work and that it's a steep learning curve, but the fact is that I'm having a very, very hard time feeling comfortable in the role. I miss northern Colorado-- I'd lived there for almost 6 years, and I knew the area. I knew all my favorite hangouts, the downtown area, etc. This is a totally new region with a very different feel to it, and I don't know it very well yet. Friday's my birthday (which my new supervisor is letting me have off, very nicely too since we are severely understaffed in my new department), and I've vowed to go to the local park and try a local coffee place. I think making more of an effort to get familiar with the area will help me. Saturday I'm getting my second tattoo and I'm going on a date, and I've asked him to choose a place down here. Everyone-- my mom, my counselor, my psych-- is telling me to be patient with myself, and I'm trying to be. Yesterday I was in tears at work and even felt physically sick. I don't want to be that way today. I'm going to make a greater effort to acclimatize myself, although I'm still having trouble accepting that or won't happen overnight. ",depression

Requiring several injections a day, constantly pricking fingers for blood tests 15-20 times daily, requiring hypersensitivity to anything I eat and all activities, have made life difficult enough. I suffer Degenerative Disc Disease and have had neck surgeries, that require more. I've been out of work for a year and I can't envision a better future for myself. I'm so terribly sad and depressed, everyday i am constantly fighting battles with myself to keep it together and push away SI. I'm in so much physical pain every day, constantly on pain meds. I hate my life, I hate what I've become.
Since my injury, my fiance has been overwhelmed and a toll has been taken on our relationship. I can't bear her with my problems anymore.
I've seen six therapists and each of them have literally given up telling me they don't know how to help. For the most part, I'm an articulated man and they flat out say they ""don't want to beat around the bush, but""..""Regular therapy won't help me."" My last and final therapist actually recommended me this site, which I've been extremely hesitant to jump into. I really don't know what else to do.

And to my understanding what that means, not acceptable or not as good as should be, and to hear this is not nice especially when you suffer and struggle through your own insecurities and doubts about yourself. The last few weeks I cannot even begin to say how many times I have heard that phrase or something similar to that phrase. That I'm not good enough, I am truely to a point where I am torn down and I dont know what the hell is. I have fought to hard against others and against myself to be good enough in others eyes...

Imposter Syndrome,"I learned about it a few days ago when I called the local crisis hotline-- the counselor I spoke with was listening to my fears about work, my love life, friendship, my future, and she asked me if I'd ever heard of it. I had no idea what she was talking about until she explained it to me, and it was absolutely terrifying because it sounds 100% like my life. When you have Imposter Syndrome, you feel like a fraud, like nothing good that has happened to you has been the result of your own achievements. Like you can't be yourself around anyone because the real you is not good enough. That's me. I think about everything I've done-- moving out here on my own, getting promoted, buying a place of my own, etc.-- and even when my parents say they are proud of me, my only response is ""Meh."" I feel like it wasn't my doing-- I've been lucky, I've known the right people, I've had help. It wasn't me. I feel like a total failure, like I'm hiding a shameful secret and that it's only a matter of time before my mask slips off and everyone learns the truth. And I am wearing a mask of a sort, because I know people won't really like me if they actually get to know me. Looking back, eople have given me their numbers and offered to meet up outside of school and work, and I've taken them but have never followed through because of my intense fear that a) they really didn't mean what they said and/or b) that they would turn and run away once they met the real me. Because I really fear that the real me is a horrific creature that has to be locked up behind a facade. Im going to talk with my counselor about this-- we met today and honestly, we had something else on the agenda that needed talked about. But this will be the next issue we discuss.

Depression and Fatigue after Quitting Geodon,"Hi, everyone. I just wanted to come on here and share my experience with stopping Geodon and see if anyone has any advice for me.
In November of 2018, I stopped taking Geodon cold turkey after being on it for almost six years. I was put on Geodon for an ""unspecified mood disorder"". Here is the thing, I never had a mood disorder of any type. I just had doctors who wants to make money off of me and to drug me up. I was seeing a social worker at the time, who physically assaulted me. He made up lies about me to the psychiatrist that I was seeing and I was put on many drugs, and Geodon is the one they kept me on.
I stopped seeing that particular social worker and started to see a new social worker, who truly understood me. He did not think I needed to be on Geodon at all. I just needed someone that I could trust and talk to, and he has helped me tremendously. Over time, I started to see a nurse practicioner instead of the old psychiatrist. She wanted to keep me on the Geodon. My social worker talked to her and said I did not need any medication, and he also said that the Geodon was really drugging me out. The nurse practicioner said I would ""go crazy"" without Geodon. I was pissed. 
One night in November 2018, I had finally had enough. I quit Geodon 80mg cold turkey. The withdrawals were not nearly as bad as I expected them to me. One problem I have been facing is not being able to sleep, hardly at all. If I do sleep, it is very poor quality. I was so tired from having no sleep that I was afraid to drive because I was so tired. I kept calling into work, and eventually just quit because I felt like a bad employee for calling in so much. Now, I have a new job and I am not calling in no matter how tired I am. Also, I am a full-time college student. 
I feel like my body is slowly dying and breaking down. I constantly have big bags under my eyes and I am overall depressed from my fatigue of no sleep. Two or three nights out of the week I am up from 36-48 hours at a time. I need help. Any advice is appreciated. My nurse practicioner has no knowledge of me quitting Geodon. I also quit the clonidine that she put me on for ""racing thoughts"", cold turkey. I am currently just on Propranolol for my high blood pressure and occasional Temazepam for sleep, (it does not help anymore). I feel so depressed. I cry almost every day because I am so tired and feel like I cannot make it through college or keep up with work. I have just about a year until I get my degree. I was going to see my social worker this morning, but I had to cancel my appointment because I was just too exhausted to drive.
My lack of sleep is causing me some severe depression. Thank you for listening.",depression
Too much,"My tears are dry, the same way the rain dries up after having its own thunderstorm. I’ve broken down, now all I can do is stare at an empty wall. I feel nothing, yet, in some part of me I feel everything. This voice inside my head keeps me locked up under the bed sheets, I can’t find the courage to get up, I feel more alone than ever. Until, I thought of how I miss seeing sunsets or how I miss going to the mall with friends. I’ve been my own enemy, and now I have to be my own hero. I began to count all of my blessings, slowly I began to realize the beauty in life. Piece by piece I was able to get out of bed and enjoy life once again, how everything used to be. I overcame this, and I know one day, that you will too",depression

A better day.,"thank you for all the kind replies from my post earlier this week.  thank you so much.
today is a better day.
i was diagnosed with disabling conditions in 1997.  i continued working until 2010.  at that point i was a shell......my doctor ordered me onto the bench.  she said enough......stop work or you will die.  ohhhhhhh.........myyyyyyy.  i finally heard her.  i stopped, i was so ill at that point that i was only able to get out of my house every 6 to 8 weeks to run an hour or two of errands.  the rest of the time i was housebound......too ill to mind.
i found DS in the fall of 2010, that was a real Godsend.......I found people like me, I found hope........I was able to fight through the brain fog and begin to formulate a plan to adjust, to figure out how to live as the person I am, not the person I was.  I worked really hard to find joy, to rediscover my smile........I worked in every area I could think of, I even went so far as to create a mission statement.  I changed doctors, medicines, the way I do housework......the way I shop, the way I do so many things.  I changed what I watched, read, wear......I changed and changed and changed.  And through these changes I found my smile again, I found joy..........I found a new appreciation for the simplest of things.  I found a self that got to do things.......I had gratitude and faith.  I still do.........
So there I've been moving through the challenges of life changing health issues.  Finding ways to deal with the obstacles of flares, that leave you alone for weeks sometimes months at a time.  I've had to deal with a lot.  There are many of you out there who have also faced very serious challenges and my heart is with you and for you!  To encourage you, to pray for you.........to be compassionate for all you are dealing with.  It is hard........through all that is hard, you are worth it.  Working though stuff, finding a life......finding purpose, peace, contentment and joy. 
Worth it!
My pain levels began to climb, but since I'm always in pain I thought it was just worse than usual but more of the same.  Then it got to the point where the pain was handling me and not the other way around.  My son brought something to my attention on a day when I was trying to hide my pain, obviously not well.......and he wanted to know what was going on.  It is not like me/my character to be a snotty talker......to snap at or snipe at others.  I'm usually the calm patient type.....so for me to be a butthead was NOTICEABLE.  sigh......trying to inject some humor into all this......
This heightened pain led me back to my rheumatologist.  She suspected that I had another disease.  How could I have another disease? I already have my own pretty impressive list.  No others need apply........but on Monday of this week it was confirmed that I have not one but two more autoimmune conditions.......
I've been taking prednisone for the past few months and it's knocking the stuffing outta me.  I've gained weight, I'm having problems breathing, healing from a cut or bruise, I'm dehydrated despite drinking lots of fluids, I can't lie down to sleep......my pain is through the roof, and I am at even higher risk to catch anything........I don't need to be around anyone to catch bad stuff.......I got scared.  sooooo scared, so overwhelmed.........and freaked out.  i had a meltdown on the phone with my son......which made me feel like a crudmonkey.  i don't like to cry ever.....but especially now, i can't afford to spend my limited energy on tears.......and i feel extra bad putting this on my son's shoulders.  i feel like i should be telling anyone else that is not my children.......but i don't have that.  i mean yes i can and have shared it with my ds pals, but it's not the same as realtime hugs and understanding.
i hope y'all can understand what i mean.  i have CFS/ME, Fibromyalgia, Sjogren's Syndrome, Osteoarthritis, Stenosis, GERDS, High Blood Pressure, Thyroid Disease, Barretts Esophagus, and more......diseases that all impact my autoimmune system.
But as of Monday it's official I also have Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) and Hypogammaglobulinemia......it felt like the roof came down on my head.  I saw my rheumy on Friday but she said I had to come back to give even more blood for additional tests asap.......so I came in on Monday feeling like the crap on the bottom of pondscum's cousin's shoe of death. 
yeah, a bad day........they couldn't get any blood outta my arms so they went for my hands.  every vein they stuck blew up.......then i found out i had a balance of unpaid visits i didn't know i had......so i had to pay them an unanticipated amount that day.  that didn't ease my worries at all......and I don't understand why they had not sent me a bill.......they agreed that they need to do a better job.  duh.......
a limited disability budget doesn't do well on big balances, i try to keep that even too, by paying things each and every month so there are no surprises as much as that is possible to manage......
then i went to my regular doctor cause the difficulty breathing scared me, yes i had gained weight taking prednisone, and gotten the moon face people talk about.....but my sleep apnea had not been an issue for me in YEARS.......so this really scared me.  see i've also had DVTS in my left  leg and life threatening pulmonary embolisms in both lungs, so the breathing thing could be sleep apnea or it could mean a clot.  which is very scary to me......gotta pop the scary balloons and find out what is going on.
meanwhile i am supposed to schedule a mammogram and then after seeing my regular doc he had somebody call me about going to see a pulmonologist, which i have zero memory of him suggesting that this was needed.  so i am scared, frustrated, worried and forgetful .....
my reg doc told me that the prednisone had caused the new weight gain, the moon face, the bruising, the slow to heal cuts, the breakouts on my face (i never even had acne as a teen, but now........oh my).  the difficulty sleeping, breathing, my blood sugars are off.....suggesting that i am prediabetic all because of the PREDNISONE........there is more bad stuff than this but you get the idea.......I need to be off prednisone asap cause my body is going crazy setting off health alarms. 
they are testing me for TB/Hepatitis.....not that they think i have those diseases, somehow its to make sure my body is strong enough, healthy enough to be on methotrexate, which is how they want to treat the PMR.  there will also be a treatment for the hypogammaglobulinanemia but i don't remember what that is........
after my regular doc i had to go to the hospital and have a chest x-ray.....and still get myself safely home.  my left leg and foot were so swollen that i couldn't get regular shoes on.........i stopped to buy some soft slippers on the way home cause it hurt too much to drive barefooted......i cried putting my left tennis shoe back on and limped into the store........but thankfully found some soft dearfoams at ross.....velvety navy blue no hurt slippers. 
i also have pain from diverticulitis at present........and while writing this i had an accident on the way to the bathroom.  (i know this is a tmi moment, but i am in the all alone mode of a flare with too many symptoms and too many diseases trying to be all fake brave today..............
even a better day like today is a rough day.  i have to find the good in the smallest of things......they matter, i matter. i am trying with all my might to have a good day. to be in a calm place in order to handle this.  i wrote a note today to the pastor of the church asking if he could send me some visitors........i need to bring the outside in, know that life is happening. that there is something good out there making it worth it to get back even in the smallest of parts.
when i feel good i try to be a part of the community, volunteer time at the local museum, the festivals, the blood bank, help children in need, help the food bank......get out of my head and see the world as a good place, a joyous place where we GET to help......where we GET to do......Monday was a last straw kind of day and I lost it.......I was on the edge of WHYMEVILLE in the STATE of ENOUGH IS ENOUGH......but apparently I was wrong about that.  There is worse, but hopefully I will find a way through this newest challenge.....I will find heart and hope and light and a measure of peace. 
My glands are so swollen...my spine is in rough shape, I'm dizzy and hit the door way a few times, but thankfully I didn't fall in the shower today.  Any little bit of good is good.  I did the dishes, put the trash in the garage, have laundry going on........I fed my kitties.  I am alive.  I have to keep managing no matter what cause I'm worth fighting for. 
Behind every good cry is a lot of MAD......maybe the mad will help me fight this.  I may have to fight gently and carefully and quietly but don't discount the quiet fights........I've come along way since I got permanently benched in 2010 and I will do it again.  The reality is that I'm gonna have sadness, fears and worries......the reality is that I've got to push to bring people into my life.......since I have flares/crashes I get life going and then withdraw to heal......and when that happens my life stops, my new tentative friendships and links to the community stop too.  And that's when the alone hits --- that's when I am at my most vulnerable.  This awareness will help me sort things out past this new big bad storm......I have to believe that I can.  That I will, that I am worth it.",depression

Feeling some type of way,"Nothing seems to be going right in my life whether it be things breaking in my apartment or getting yelled at work or feeling like an inconvenience when I need a ride and I made to be an inconvenience due to ptsd from a car accident, and nothing seems to matter much anymore.

No one seems to really care, I know I'm not acting myself but no one checks on anyone these days, no one asks ""hey how are things goin?"" Everyone is too busy in their perfect world's to disrupt their lives.  Everyone has someone that they can go home to and vent about their day, or hold them when they cry. Nobody cares that I've got struggles going on in my life that I'm trying to battle, it's just ""why can't you come cover this work shift"" while that same day I'm rushing my pet to the vet because she's in pain, but that doesn't matter. I've said numerous times to my best friend that I'm just done with everything and it's shoved off as nothing. I'm not suicidal, but I want a different life. I'm so tired of waking up every day and dreading the reality. Everyday it's the same shit where I go to work, fake a smile, come home and go to bed. Even on my days off I can't seem to get the motivation to even leave my room, let alone open a curtain. I don't know what to do to get out of this funk but it just seems like no matter what I do, I'm an inconvenience to someone, no matter how many times I'm nice to someone or how many times I worry about someone and check on them, that good karma doesn't come my way, who put this curse on me and when will it go away. I'm just tired of being tired.",depression
More struggles than good times,"I’ve come to the conclusion that the struggles in my life have far outweighed the brief moments of joy. This trend is ongoing, and I guess that’s what depresses me most. It’s hard knowing that life is mostly completely shitty and I have to endure it all just to get to the extremely sporadic peaceful times. If you think about time, most people spend at least  40 hours per week working at jobs that are not rewarding, with very little, if any, extra money left for pleasure. After figuring in approximately 8 hours of sleep per night, that only leaves us with maybe 50-60 hours for other things. Those other things are usually just trying to keep up with daily chores   and trying to recover from the 40+ hours of stress. I understand that’s a blanket statement, and some people have very different schedules and circumstances, but it definitely sums up my life. Nothing is ever easy or without problems attached. I don’t think was just born a pessimist; this is my reality. The majority of my life sucks, which always causes me to ask why the fuck was I even born. ",depression
preferences of some people,"some people seem to prefer to see me as a mean bitch,  they don't want to be my friend unless I'm talking shit, and that's just not who I want to be.  I really don't get it.",depression
What it Takes,"Hello, everyone.  This post is more general here, but definitely applies to this group, especially.  Basically, I wanted to show what it has taken me to keep going in life, even though I am still not at my absolute best point, yet.  I do not know if I will see that day for various reasons, but it is worth the shot.  For those who suffer as bad as I do on the daily, here are the things I have tried to cope to an extent:Walking, exercise, watching TV or youtube, support groups, medication, melatonin, cognitive behavioral therapy, crisis text line, talking to family and friends, eating better, waking up earlier, going to sleep earlier, thinking positive, embracing moving forward, leaving negativity behind, developed coping/defense mechanisms, law of attraction, dressing up, buying responsibly, helping others, smiling more, being more positive, laughing through the pain, crying when needed, mental health days/pampering, loving and embracing self, focusing on the ""now"", listening to music, becoming more spiritual, looking forward to events, socializing, thinking better of myself/knowing worth, and probably more.  I still feel like complete shit some days and lay in bed depressed but I am at least making the effort to better myself instead of harming myself.  Hope you all can see it can take so much to keep going but hopefully the effort is worth it!",depression
No place for me,"Need a place to vent anonymously, can't really trust anyone and have no support system. I'm an old longtime Christian with a life filled with depression and loneliness. I'm a church member but not part of the church family. I've been engaged in some church ministries for a few years but im not really part of what goes on. I'm still committed to 2 ministries but whenever I'm free of that I'm not going to church anymore. I did the best I could for several years but it's obvious church Doesn't work for me. There is a flaw I'm my personality that can't be fixed. I need a place like this to get things out.

Ended,"I should be happy. I'm now engaged my mom is somewhat better and the house isn't as messed up. But I'm not. I want to kill myself more then I have in years. Maybe it would be for the best o mean my fiance doesn't seem to want to talk to me right now and I don't know what I did but I had to of done something. I make everyone's life hell. I can't do anything right. And everyone thinks I have to this happy perfect little princess when all I want to the lay down in the sun and never get up or wake up for that matter. Or I could get in a car and drive as far away as I can both would make my family's life better. Cause no matter what I do I'm always hurting someone here, I try to make sure everyone is happy and has what they need. And it's never enough. And on top of that this is the month my baby would have been born if I hadn't had a miscarriage. So there that too sometime make a me feel like I did something wrong, that I killed it. But you know we aren't to think of those things we r just to sit there and look pretty and smile. But I'm fucking done smiling.",depression
not doing that great,"my name is Anna, I can’t say for certain how long I’ve been struggling but it’s been a few years. I’m 16, and I had fineally thought I was improving. But to just have that crushed in the dirt by the same vicious cycle. Does anyone know how to stop spiraling? I feel locked out of my own head and like I have no control over what I think, feel, or do. I want to get better, but I don’t know how. ",depression
Falling Back,"Trying to stay positive this year as a whole.  Recently it took a toll on me when I became suddenly more depressed and suicidal, which escelated unbelievably quickly for the amount of positivty and good vibes I was trying to put on myself.  Lately, my body physically feels like it is in excruciating emotional pain, but causing physical sensations, if that makes sense; my emotions physically hurt my body and make me feel like I'm being flattened or crushed, with harder breathing and no motivaton.  Nothing is doing justice like it used to.  I can't move forward like I thought because I still have feelings for an ex which feels like a soulmate and whoever else I talk to, I cant feel it going further because I lack the feelings for them... Something's gotta give and I'm tired of being called crazy or names for how I feel even though I know feeling the way I do is not normal. Im sorry there's things wrong with me? Though I could live without the stigma and namecalling for still having feelings, while trying to reput myself out on the dating market to meet new people.  Slurs really hurt me, especially by friends who I know mean no harm and only joke that I try to ""be with someone"" new each week, but it's another knife at my heart, when I just want to talk and get to know someone. I strive for honest and serious love, but oh well; ready for a group member on here to be concerned and label me as crazy or stupid or something.",depression
I'm new to this site,I'm new here been really depressed lately I'm 37/f and I'm disabled was born with spina bifida I been through a lot and just need some friends and a little support.my real dad disowns me and I was almost raped when I was younger and then have a few people that passed away the latest one was my grandpa it will be 2 years March 25th.i have bipolar and depression and pstd and anxiety,depression
Few steps back...,"Now before I jump right in to whats bothering me now, i would like to say that I have struggled with depression for years now and althgough it has gotten alot better throughout the years and I have learned to find ways to better understand why i feel the way i feel but recently my progress to pulling myself out of a depressed state of mind has reduced due to the incidents that have occrued this past year. I've always had issues with being expressive with my feelings but now that i am older i have tried to be a bit more verbal with them. From being in an abusive relationship with my father in my younger years to now i think i have come a long way but like i said recently my depression has worsened. January of 2017, I lost one of my best friends, she passed away due to a drug overdose. I was devasted and didnt know what to do, then may of 2017, i lost, my great aunt someone who was a super important part of my life. And then July 12 of 2017, I lost my other half my 15 year old sister who i think about evryday. and when i lost her my whole entire world came crashing i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat. I couldn't even spend 5 minutes alone by myself with out having suicidal thoughts or just incredibly sad. And i klnow that its normal for me to feel incredibly sad but its been 7 months almost and i still sometimes just have suicidal thoughts because i want so badly to be reunited with my sister. And it just seems like im affecting evryone else around me. There are times where i just want my pain to stop and in those moments i just dont eat or just sit and do nothing.",depression
Recurring troubles,"Things in my life started to look up for a change. I started living with my dad as my mom moved out of the state and this has helped me a lot to be less stressed and I feel like I'm in a safe environment now. Although as I moved to my dad's, I realized that I moved farther away from my friends. My female friend in particular helped me a lot to move past my last relationship and means a lot to me. With being busy with school and not being able to drive myself to see her, I began to feel lonely again. Over time we stayed in contact and I started to develop feelings for her. Although she had dated guys before, she mostly dates girls and says that she is gay. A few months ago i confessed to her and knowing she was gay i decided to tell her it was just to get it off my chest and asked her to forget about it. After almost a year of not seing her in person I met up with her tonight with a bunch of other people for a bonfire. The whole night made me feel terrible. It seemed like she was way more interested in talking to her other friends all night. It's pathetic but I started to feel really sad and really hoped that she would attempt to hang out more with me while there. Sadly that didn't really happen. And it made me feel terrible. Almost like I was sub-par to all her other friends. She asked as I was leaving why I looked like I wasent having fun but I couldn't tell her anything right there in front of everybody. I'm hope now and I can't even think straight. My heart hurts and I'm having trouble stopping that. I know she prefers girls and that most people might say to accept that, but it's not that simple. I have trouble getting over feeling like this and I really just don't know how to cope with it. I feel terrible.",depression
Comes and Goes,"My depression really makes it hard for me to enjoy my life. It comes in waves; one minute I'm fine, and the next minute I feel so hopeless and miserable. The funk is hard to get out of, and I just wish it would be consistent. I wish I could be either one or the other, as strange as that may sound. There seems to be no reason behind it either, although I'll admit that my new job is a bit stressful. I'm still in training, and I keep feeling like I'm not doing well. Everyone says not to worry and that it's a very steep learning curve for my new position, but I still worry regardless. I'm really tired of being anxious all the time; it makes it very hard to get into a productive or positive mindset. ",depression
Alone.,"I know I am not alone, but I feel alone. My husband is sleeping next to me but I feel like I am million of miles away.  I'm probably all up in my vagina with my emotions as I'm on so much medication dir to this horrid cold. I just feel alone. I feel like I've no one to talk to. I feel like I am losing it. ",depression
Music when I am depressed,"In my ""normal"" life, I have a big problem with emotions.  It seems like the only way I can feel anything is through music. I listen to uptempo music to feel ""up""; Heavy Metal and Death Metal when I am supposed to feel anger.  
It seems I play these a lot more than is good for me.  Although in a way they make me feel like I am not alone and someone can relate to me.

ready to open up a little,"hey,
i joined this group a few days ago because some of my friends and family saw the self-inflictment cuts that i have upon myself (even if i do them in places to conceal them because all i really want is the pain and i dont care if that is either on my arms or legs. 
i have been really exhausted these last few weeks because i havent been able to sleep well at all and ive just been miserable all of the time (even if i do smile and laugh sometimes, my insides are burning with the will to just go back home and cut myself). because of this, despite what i wished for, i have not been very regular here. i have tried to take a read at what you all write but i havent been very successful, and i have been even less so at expressing what im feeling. so for this, im sorry, i will try and be better, since last time just saying what i felt helped me greatly  
i have been really miserable for a few minths now but i think that i havent been depressed for more than a month and a half. i know that it may seem pathetic to complain about it since there are people here who have been suffering for much longer than i have and therefore deserve to be helped more than i. 
however, i started to cut some time ago so as to feel something. at first, i could control my urges and would take a knife out one time every two or three weeks, however it got worse and i have become addicted to it  it just takes all of the pain away for a while  however, this stopped happening not long ago
i can be miserable, cut myself, and contunue to be in a terrible state  which was nothing that i had felt like  i stared to cut myself every timeni would feel sad and even kept a knife in my draw as well as some desinfectant so as to be able to hae access to it at all times  
one day however, i found that i no longer had the knife and saw it downstairs  my parents, whom i still live with, have not confronted me about it, even if they know that i have cut myself before  i dont think that they can deal with thinking that i have started again  because of this, the fact that my grandma died last year and would dissaprove of me doing this, my sister and my friends, i really want to be able to stop doing everything, because it really has been taking a toll on my life, especially my writing, which i used to do nearly all the time and my numbers went down when i started to feel terrible and cut  
the other day i needed to cut myself, so i got some razor blades  i had cut myself with these before, but not so deep, and this made me realise (the last two times that i have done so) that it might help me stop, for the cuts are much deeper and i only have the force and the will to do one, and then i feel a little better  
because of the fact that i am not yet of age and live with my parents, i have not gone to a doctor or someone who would be able to prescribe me something that might help  i dont know if i should risk it  
thank you for taking the time to read this, just writing it made the rock on my heart loosen up a little bit  i hope that you will tell me whether what my temporary solution is alright or whether it will just make everythign worse  i will frequent this page some more so as to do my best to help you all too  
thanks

I don't know what to do anymore,"I've been having problems at school. I've been getting bullied a bit. It's nothing physical, but it's mental torture for me.
It happens in the hallways. I will just be walking to my class and someone will whisper in my ear ""Fat"" or ""Ugly"" or they will make pig noises. I've told my parents and they help me feel better but I don't know what else to do because I have no idea who these people are. They are just random people in the halls.
I am trying to be positive and hope that it will stop, but it's getting worse. I don't know if I should tell the counselor because I don't know who is making fun of me and I don't know what she could do to stop it other than some Anti-Bullying posters and Anti-Bullying assemblies because those are a bunch of crap.
I feel more depressed at school, to begin with, and I don't need bullying added to it. I don't want to be looking over my shoulder, wondering who is going to make fun of me next. I swear I can hear the insults in my head.",depression
Darkness is creeping back in,"The depression is starting to cover me again. There has not been any trigger or reason for it but the wee bit of hope that I had that I might not kill myself anytime soon is starting to fade away. I am losing interest in everything, even the one or two things that got me out of bed yesterday means absolutely nothing to me now. Even though I loved volunteering yesterday, today it holds no meaning to me. I might just quit and run away, again.",depression
Loosing it again,"I'm starting to lose my shit again. I'm doing what I can to try to not focus on my emotional pain and to think of my kids and remember that life isn't just about one person. But, damn, I miss my wife. 
She went out again with some guy she has been seeing for the last month. It is getting too much for me to handle. But I know if I freak out and get upset, she'll end it with him and our life will go back to the way it has been, which is struggle after struggle with no end in sight and with her being miserable. That's not fair to her. I try to think of her, the kids and their future. I try to let go and show I love her as much as I claim by allowing her to go and to be happy. But I'm not happy. I miss her, I miss everything. And because I cannot quit focusing on it, I'm starting to spiral and sleep is already eluding me. 
Here's the thing. I know she still loves and cares for me. Our life would be so much different if I were healthy. But I'm not. And the strain of taking care of me for the last 7 years has taken its toll on her. I get that. But I know if she starts to get serious with this guy, our relationship will change into something I won't recognize. I don't want that. So I am being selfish by not wanting to let her go. I know this. I want her to be happy. But I want to be happy too. It is an impossible situation where maybe neither one of us can win. I just got out of the hospital because of this shit, I let it overwhelm me. I am trying my best to refocus the anger inside and try to tackle it differently. But my head keeps coming back around to how miserable I am without her. I cannot make one person the focal point of my happiness. But she is a source of it, and I like how I feel when I am around her, I don't want to give that up. And now you guys can see the bad spiral I am in. I cannot seem to get my head out of it.
Since the knives were removed from the house, I'm wondering how bad it would kill my stomach to down all the tylenol and advil I have. I am sick of fighting when I don't seem to have anything to fight for. My kids will be taken care of. My wife is moving on. I don't get along with my family enough to even try to stick around for them. Man, I thought I had a better handle on this, but once again, I'm going down.",depression
So now what?,"Its been almost a year since I joined DS, and everyone has been so nice and helpful. Yet I can’t get out of my own way. I feel like I’m trapped in this bubble lately and if I keep everything outside of it I’ll get by. Barely get by, but still at least make it till tomorrow. I know that bubble is gonna pop and everything is gonna come crashing down. A year and I’ve done nothing to change my situation. I did try meds but the doctor that prescribed them isn’t my regular doctor. I go to him every few months for my ulcers. I just couldn’t make it past the first week on them. I see my regular doctor and she is somewhat dismissive about my depression. Maybe I’m reading into her wrong since I have high blood pressure borderline diabetes and early stages of glaucoma and some bad discs in my back, so I guess priorities right. I always understood depression was a real thing, you know growing up in the 80’s and 90’s people where dismissive about things like this. I’m not saying I’m saintly for believing this to be a real problem for people, but I will say I never thought it was like this. I guess my question is now what? I know I’m depressed and have anxiety, even if only for a year but now what. What do I do now. I know I need to see a therapist of some sort, maybe need a change in meds. But how do I do that when it take all my effort just to get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes I feel like a child that can’t help themselves and I feel worse than before. Lucky I have the attitude of not letting the world have its way with me, but everyday I feel that spirit slip away but by bit. ",depression

When you don't belong....,"Here is an idea of the things I've gone through. Parents divorced when I was 13, my mom had cheated on my dad with his brother. They both got married a few years later and pretty much cast me aside. My father's had no time for me anymore and my mother got married and left the state. My mother got divorced again and my father has been having a hard time in his own marriage. Everyone I've ever trusted, has lied to me. My first girlfriend was raped, my second cheated on me. I've had 4 girlfriends before. My current girlfriend's family, does not like me and most of them have never even given me a chance to even meet me. She has broken my trust because she doesn't know how to open up.
Because of her lies, and my past, it is a hard for me to continue trusting her. She sees this as a red flag. She also puts A LOT of emphasis on the validity her family gives her and most of her decsions are influcenced by her family. I recognize my faults and I am constantly trying to work on them, but nothing is ever good enough. She is the perfect child, and I am the broken guy who no one wants around. What could I do to get her family to give me a chance instead of casting me aside like every other situation in my life.",depression
I suffer from Depression and Anxiety,"I have been on sertaline for depression and anxiety off and on over the past 10 years; this time I have been on it since October 2013. I feel like my depression and anxiety is being managed with the sertaline but I honestly go back and forth as to whether or not I need it. I have tried going off of it a couple times over the past 5 1/2 years and I taper off but seem to not do well with either the withdrawal syptoms coming off the medication or I can't manage without them so then I go back on it. I am not exaclty needing any advice one way or another; I just wanted to share this struggle with my internal dialogue as to whether or not I truly need the sertaline that and I am not sure the long term effects of being on it.
Also, I wanted to share that right now I am taking a course for Group Counseling for my Marriage and Family Masters degree and I needed to be part of a group which could be either an in-person or online group. Because of my busy schedule right now I felt that an online group would be better.
I look forward to interacting with all of you.",depression
I'm spiralling again,I'm falling back into depression again after being fine for almost a year. I know it's caused by added stress in my life but it's taking an awful toll on me. I've barely got the motivation to even go to bed even though all I want to do is sleep. I'm feeling so incredibly sad and empty and I've gone back to binge eating which has an even worse effect on me now because of health issues I'm having. I've had some scary self destructive thoughts and urges today and I'm scared for myself. I don't want to be super derpessed again like I was around this time last year. I hate this I feel like I can't win. I just want to be normal and happy but I can't. ,depression
Not my morning,This is so not my morning. I had a doctor appointment that I forgot about and I burned my finger on the pan when I was making eggs. I slept horribly last night and I am so freaking tired. I just want to go home and sleep the day away instead of being at school.,depression
Afraid,"So my anxiety has gotten worse, I am now getting panic attacks every time I go into a bath room, for no reason at all. Last night it got so bad that my fiance had to almost drag my on to my feet and hold me and still I was shaking and crying. 
And then there's my mom who snapped at me for going on a trip for my anniversary. She said that we (me and my fiance) shouldn't have gone and we should have stayed home and given her the money that we used for the trip to pay for rent when she said that we didn't have to pay rent for this month. I can't do anything thing outside of the house with out her yelling at me for never being home even tho I'm almost always home making sure the kitchen is clean picking up after the others in the house shoveling snow ECT.  It's to the point where I fear the fiance might try standing up for me and get kicked out, like my sister's bf and if I don't break up with him I'll get kicked out and disowned. And as shitty as my family is its all I have.
More and more I just want to pack a bag and disappear fall off the face of the earth.",depression

I need to see my psychologist asap. I don't want to wait 5 more days. I can't handle it. I don't want to hurt myself but I feel like I have to to shut myself up. I just want to sleep but I'm afraid to sleep because I think more and because I think mlre I get worse. I din't know what to do.

A little introduction about myself,"My depression is a bit different when compared to others. I have no particular reason for being depressed and it is more of a general lack of enthusiasm and hope. I am 25 with a master's degree in computer science. I have lived in 2 different countries. I quit my job in California and moved back home(India) because I tried to kill myself due to have absolutely no hope in life(I had a steady relationship and everyone in my life was extremely supportive, the job was good aswell, I was just so exhausted and bored with life). My parents, relatives and friends are extremely supportive even though I am not working (haven't been working for the past 6 months). I have absolutely no goals in life and I cannot work in a place where I am not into it 100%. I have ADD and doing something that bores me is hellish for me. I doubt that I will ever be interested in anything. I am volunteering in a government school as a teacher at the moment. I love kids and the person that I describe myself to be is not the one that I seem to be. I am seen laughing, playing childish pranks and joking pretty much all the time so it is impossible for anyone to know that my only wish is to die. Honestly, I am not sure why I am even sharing this. I just need a platform where I don't hide all the time.
Oh and I do have a therapist and psychiatrist. I have changed 3 so far and the current ones are splendid. They understand everything that I am going through and they try to help me. I have MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and a mix of cluster B personality disorders. They have helped me understand myself and they give excellent advice. They have helped me come out from a phase where I was actively thinking about killing myself. Now I just passively wish to die while I carry on with my so called life. I tried my best to come out of it but as time passes, the more I am conviced that my situation is chronic and I won't live to see 30.",depression
New / Introduction,"I was on DS about 11 years ago, with a different account and pretty much a different life. I have been struggling with depression off and on through the years, and it is recently come to a head. I've found myself in an isolated work/life situation, with very little to no personal support, and certainly no outside friends or family to speak of. 
Over the last 11 years, life has done what it does, and has left me with an immediate (and extended family) of two (my dad and his sister). I have connected with my birth mother's family (both birth parents are deceased). Check out my first journal post for the full summary of the last 11 years.
Back in September, just after Labor Day, I was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) from a tick bite in mid-June (yes, I kept going with it for just over 2 months with it before seeing a doc). Since June I have struggled physically in ways that I never imagined. Now I am to a point where I need support, someone to talk me off the ledge every now and then; I'm isolated from my friends and family and don't have the physical strength to visit them or do the things that used to keep me sane.",depression
I'm so tired,"I am so freaking tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I am tired. I wake up during the night about 5+ times which doesn't help at all. I've tried so many things. I've tried medicine, hot baths, lavender spray for my pillows, relaxation techniques, etc, but it doesn't help. I have depression and I know depression can increase fatigue but something should be helping me get the restful sleep I need and my doctors aren't concerned about it. I cannot keep living like this.",depression
No one can understand,"I'm leaving  my parents house soon.all my parents see is my mistakes and tries to pull me down  if I didn't really did anything wrong .Everything that goes wrong in the family  is my fault .
For more information , I'm 19 years old I'm saving money to leave home .My family there disrespectful they treat me like im there maid i don't understand  them .there so mean and than they'll become so nice to you suddenly  .it's so weird. Ive been cleaning the house for 3 years  by myslef and now at the same time working part time . And cooking for the family .my parents get mad when I don't cook but there's no food in the refrigerator.  They make me responsible for there problems .I have 3 brothers 1 move out .   My brothers they belittle me just like my parents. And my parents won't  do anything about it .
My brother that's living at the house still is 24years old and 14 years old .the one who left is 23 years  old which he is also a mean brother.My brothers try to make my day miserable and does things on purpose . My parents is never content with what I do for the family .They try to make me feel guilty to do every single thing they say. My dad usually acts like his going to do something bad to me when I take my stand and don't do what they say.  
I live with my parents and brothers and I don't have car I dont know how to drive .I have a part time job I have to ride with my brother to work we both work at the same place which make things worse . I don't have a family member that could help me .most of my relatives are all the same mean and disrespectful.

New here,"Hey everyone! I don't know if I am in the right area or doing the right thing by even writing on here, but I thought I would try. I have been struggling lately (a few months) with myself. I have never felt so bad looking in a mirror, and seeing all these flaws (not just physical). I have good days but bad days as well. I have always been the type of person that others can depend on and trust. I check up on people when I know they're not ok. Nobody checks on me though. My fiance tries, but due to me being in school we are doing long distance so that isn't helpful either. I have so many negative thoughts about myself I eventually just break down. I can't fully express how I feel to anyone because I don't feel like they understand. There are just so many things weighing in my mind that it has pushed me towards thinking of harming or not eating. I struggle so much with myself that somedays I don't want to see anyone or get out of bed. Anyways, that's me and I would love feedback if you have any. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this.",depression

Been awhile,"It has been a very long time since I posted on this site. I've had ups and downs the past year or so. But I think I need to try to be a part of this community. I often feel useless and worthless, but maybe despite not being my old, ready to rumble-tough-working guy, I still have some value. And that might be in helping others who are also having a hell of a time coping with life.
I actually just got out of the hospital. I tried to kill myself, but obviously that didn't quite go as planned. Which is a good thing. However, a silver lining, I spoke to so many doctors and they are expediting my application to get into a special program. And they may have found a couple clues as to what my progressive disease may end up being. I may never be normal or walk again, but getting answers sounds pretty damn good, especially at this pretty low point in my life.
So, anyway, I'm back. And hopefully I will stick around a bit longer than last time and maybe actually contribute. Who knows, I may even help someone else who could really use it one day.",depression

depression,"Its been a very long time since I've to the depression website.  I'm 64 years old.  I've suffered from major depression for most of my life.
I currently live in what is called a room and board home.  Now that is different from a board and care home.  Board and care has over sight, greater care and on site supervision.  Room and board provides meals and a bed and that is it.  Supposedly its for higher functioning individuals with mental health issues.  They are not licensed.  They are not regulated.  Unfortunately they don't function the way they are supposed too.  Persons who have more severe mental health issues are placed here, some with violent tendencies.  The police have been to the home where I live more times than I care to count and they don't really want to deal with the problems at all and nothing is ever done.  I've been assaulted twice and threatened numerous.  The landlords don't do anything about it either.  Now I'm very depressed because landlords keep bringing in people who's behavior is very unpredictable.  I've been in other homes that have the same problems.  Its really a racket for making money.  The diet is horrible.  The question of where to go is frustrating.  There is currently a resident who everyone is afraid of.  I'm the focus of most of his anger.  He is also a meth use.  I saw with a glass meth pipe.  The landlord says we have no concrete proof of that.  He is schizophrenic and I can't imagine that meth is doing him any good.  So....I'm very depressed about this and I really don't feel like I have many options.  This is just a really bad situation that I can't really see any way out of.  I have a therapist and she gave list of other room and boards, two of which I know are bad places too.  I have no place to go.  I've considered being hospitalized just to get away from this hell hole for a few days.",depression

My family is simply awful,"My family is awful. My life is awful.  I think about killing myself every day. it just gets worse.  i don't even know what the point of writing here is.  i write the same thing over and over again.  nothing helps. drugs, therapy, staying busy, work, .. my mental state is alwasy bad. i am always alone.  as i get older i realize taht no one in my family ever cared about me, including my mother who i thought did.  she's as selfish and uncaring as the rest of them.  never stood up for me. still doesn't.  and then i go out in the world and find NO ONE.  NO ONE to connect with, no one who voluntarily wants to spend any time with me.  i don't even get along with therapists.  what's the efin point?  really.  i try. i try really hard.  i do the things i'm supposed to do and nothing works.  seems like the meanest people sometimes do the best. my sister is a sociopath and no one even cares.  i'm the only one it bothers.  that is completely crazy to me.  i have to go to the effin store and use a high interest credit card to buy groceries cuz, yea, I'm out of money again.  god, this is the only place i have to go to talk to people who are nice.  after all these years.  either i must really really suck, or the world must really really suck.  also, i am sorry i post here so much.  i'm sure i'm a pest to some.  i don't have anywhere else to go. hope your day is going better than mine.",depression

New to the group,"Hi,
I am new to the group.  This is my first support group of any kind.  It was more difficult than I had anticipated.  Any assistance is appreciated.  I thought the on-line experience would be easier for two reasons: 1. finding the right fit for me (I was wrong); I hope I have found it here 2. that with it being on-line the pressure of being judged would be less.  I was wrong about that as well.  I feel just as much pressure about that.  
A little about myself.  I am a 48-year-old white female that lives in the midwest.  I am the mother of step-mother of 1; mother of three; grand mother of three.  I am on my second marriage.  I take care of my 85-year-old mother-in-law and my mother (that I was close to) passed away at the age of 63 of cancer 10/19/16.  I spiraled downward while taking care of her and everyone except for me.
I am a people person and try to help by listening and with humor through everything.
Again, any help in this is appreciated.  Some days I am great, other days it takes all my energy to crawl out of bed to face another day.
Thank you.

Relationship Probs.,"Hey D.S. family, hope all is well as can be expected. So I think my relationship is over! We're kind of like living like roommates. He's not good at being the support person for someone with mental illness. He thinks he understands, but he doesn't. He doesn't know anyone else with mental illness except me. We live together and this is thea worst I've been in our almost 6 year relationship. He works crazy amounts of hours, so he's not around me a lot of the time, but when he is around me, sometimes it's terrible. Sometimes because depression is so terrible, your up, your down, your thoughts are all over the place, your moods and emotions are all over the place. I understand that it can be tough for anyone, but I don't think we're good living together. I think maybe it's time I move on and just get my own place, but of course I'm struggling with that as I'm on disability and places are so expensive. I have even been looking at different alternatives to getting an apartment and so forth,  but if we did decide to stay in a relationship, we'll have to work really hard at it. I still think it will be better if I move out anyway.  I don't always understand his way of thinking. He'll say something like rude or judgemental and trigger me and then 5-10 minutes later, be trying to cuddle with me in bed like it's all good and nothing was ever said. That's not the way it works especially when you're depressed. You can't just brush harsh things off that easily. Well I can't atleast. Thanks for reading this guys. Have a good one. Hugs to all!",depression
First post,"Just joined the site.  I think it's the first time joining any support group.  I've looked into it for years but ever gotten around joining one.  Just too depressed and lack of energy to do anything.  But I guess it's a start .

Feeling useless,"I'm new to this and finally figured out how to post.  So....
It's going on 4 years now sense I had surgery that didn't go right. I came out completely numb in my whole left leg...I had to learn how to walk all over again. Then never made a full recovery. I am now disabled and cannot work. I  lost my house and car and everything now bearly making it cause disability don't give me much. I am so depressed cause I feel I can't do much for my kids. I have always been independent and to get it taken away it sucks. 

Today I broke down and cried. I hate not being able to work I want to do something but there's nothing. Also I got so upset that I said out loud when crying that I wished I could just get my leg cut off.

Same feelings different year,"When you start to feel better then you begin to hear the voices in your head and you believe them... that is what is happening right now. I was feeling good for the first time in awhile and just got slapped in the face. All that is running in my mind right now is:
""YOU ARE UGLY
YOU ARE FAT
NO ONE WANTS YOU
YOU WILL NEVER BE BEAUTIFUL""

I am not sure if this is just a new normal for me or if it is due to everyone coming to me for help, all while I am in a deep hole looking up and screaming for help from the inside. I have never felt beautiful and always felt no one wants me. I have never been the hot chick, the dateable one. I have always been the pal, the sister, the one nobody wants ever. Maybe I should just embrace this as a new normal and move on with life. IDK!",depression

"hello! New, also experience with amitriptyline?","Hello! I'm new to the group, in college and am a father. 
I was curious what anyone's experience is with amitriptyline. My friend/roommate, has recently been put on this medication again. She generally does well to keep her depression manageable, but she is trying to improve the day to day stuff that she struggles with. I'm aware when she's on medications and what they typically are. They are trying to correctly diagnose her depression and she is still trying to figure out what medication works best for her symptoms. She works full time has a son and has alot going for her. We talk about life and goals and everything and she has alot of stuff that she wants to acomplish.

Hi,im new. idk what to do,depression
Hi all just joined,"I have had depression since i was 18 since then things have gotten alot worse with my age i now have anxiety and panic attacks too...also have emphyesema and other physical problems too. 
I was homeless for 9months but recently got a houseshare with one person and we really are two different people and don't always get on. I didnt realise at the time of signing that he is friends with the landlord before he started renting from them and his ex partner witnessed the signing of the tenancy at the time i was also unaware of and so i feel that no matter what i say or do its going to go one way for me and not the way i would hope 
I have no family or friends to talk to as i have moved 365miles away to be near mum who is the only person who would offer me 3 nights a week sleep at her house dispite me having 3 grown up children and so called friends i had nowhere else to go so feel awful that i can no longer see my grandchildren and miss them dearly 
I feel so lonely and isolated and im aware that im killing myself quicker with the amount of smoking im doing but im so depressed i did take an overdose in october too",depression
Just don't get it,Just need to get this out and will take any advice. I have suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for about 9 years now.  In this elapsed time I have had it under better control because I had a better understanding of what was going on. Lately I feel like my anxiety has turned into a bit of a depression...I'm not really sure how to explain it. I can feel fine when I am out or with people but and the end of the day deep down I feel just no desire or able to be happy. It's sad like I should be able to be happy but can not find joy in much anymore. Anyone relate or have advice to just try and be in a better place? ,depression

Ivcannot tell others around me where I am at.
Not the right people.
I have texted with a couple friends.
But I need more support.
I hope I cana get some through this group.
Depression can take over my thoughts and I see my situation and world as a negative experience.
I think I am a loser and have made many poor decisions in my life.
I try to give myself a break and tell myself that I had it rough and I have done better than expected.
I take meds, exercise, and try to eat well.
I need a weekly suport group in person maybe.
I wish this was England where they have free support for people with depression.
I wonder what resources are out there in Fort Myers Florida.
I cannot pay for therapy right now.

Back step,Hey everyone for the past year I have not been on here because I was doing great. I went to group therphy it helped a lot. My boss was great if I couldn't make it in back in time to get my truck and go to my meeting I was to be dropped off and he would come pick me up from my meeting. Honestly who's boss would that?. So I was ok during the holidays. But it's been this past few weeks I'm down again and thinking self harm and suicide thoughts. As in what if I would of jumped that day. With a few things going on here I have not talked to my councilor in a month. Next week I'm going to stop by and get a meeting. All I do is sleep again and I'm tired of being tired. Me and my dog been walking to keep my busy and it feels like the house couldn't get more cleaner. I'm just tired of being in this funk and blah. I did have a hiccup in September I self harmed. I wasn't to go and get the knife I like to cut but I have not. Not sure if it's missing my Dad that's getting to me or is it something else? I have my mind is screwed up.

It's been some time,"Hello. I haven't posted on here in almost a year. I joined this site in a time where my depression was at its peak. However I'm glad to say that a few days after I last posted, I finally got medical help. I found out I have PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) and was quickly put on birth control which helped drastically. So I'm happy to say I'm in a much better place. I'm still living with extreme guilt though. Not a day goes by that I don't look at my scars and feel hatred for myself for making the decision to cut my skin. I still hurt myself on impulse sometimes but I haven't cut in awhile which is good. I'm seeing a really good psychologist that is helping me through all the guilt and even the urges I still get. However, at the moment I'm honestly not doing too great. I've been experiencing major health problems and have been in and out of the hospital for the past 2 and a half weeks. I'm in constant pain, I can't sleep, I can't eat and all this has been stripping me of motivation and has made me a little unstable. Just yesterday I had a meltdown in my sister's car which led to me hitting myself in the head until she pried my hands away from me. I'm currently experimenting with treatments with my doctor so hopefully this will all be over soon. I'll be sure to post here more often. I've been neglecting my outlets lately.",depression
Birthday Blues,"I havent posted here for sometime, but, yesterday I suddenly realised that instead of being 55 I am actually now 56, and in a weeks time 57 it will be my birthday.  In a way I am dreading it.  We used to be able to afford to go away for my birthday in Britain but a resort where the weather doesnt matter.  We cant afford that anymore.  I also realised yesterday that going by my parents death they both died in their early 70's that I dont have much time left.  I know anyone can die at any time, or get knocked over and die.  But that isnt helping me at the moment.  If we were away my birthday it would just pass by fairly easily.  This year its on a Sunday, which doesnt help, not that we will see anyone, it would be better on a Monday or Wednesday, when my disabled daughter (non visible disabilities) would not be at home for most of the day, I know I have presents, but the rest of the day is just going to be empty, its too cold to go out, and we couldnt afford it anyway.  Inside I feel so upset, but I am going to have to act happy, or at least normal for the majority of the day.  Anyone have any suggestions that could help!",depression
New day...,"Today, I tried to tell myself that things were going to be better, and I wasn't going to let all y insecurities take over.

I didn't want to talk to anyone, but I continued to smile and tell myself that I was okay.

Longest year ever,ive been dealing with this stuff for a year now and I’m no closer to getting help then I was a year ago. As a matter of fact I seem further from help. I don’t know what to do anymore. Everything is piled up and it’s too much to deal with. Every one around me is only looking out for themselves. People say they’re your friends people call themselves family. That and $3 will get you on the bus. I’m just at a crossroads I guess. I don’t know anymore ,depression
Unhappy,"I am new to this site, but I really just need someone to talk to... Every day I wake up just hating myself... Every day, I compare myself to someone wishing I was skinner, prettier, had more friends, etc. My best friend lives 5 hours away from me and I get so jealous when other people hang out with her, or she always comments back on a facebook post how that person is her number 1 supporter, and she couldn't do it without them. It makes me ad because I have always been there and supported her, and it upsets me that she says things like that. I probably shouldn't let it get to me, but it does. 
My insecurities get the best of me, and I am not sure how to deal or cope with anything. I am a full time college student, and there just ins't enough time in the day to have time for myself and to remind myself that I am okay. I hate waking up every morning dreading the day, dreading the time I have to look at myself in the mirror, dreading the time I have to talk to someone.. Even though, I tell people that I am fine, deep down inside I am not fine..
 ",depression
So Tired of Life,"I erased all my social media because I was sick of trying to be the person on social media everyone wants to be; the person who seems to have everything put together in life. I was so worried about the amount of followers I had not as much as the amount of likes I got on each photo. As if the amount of followers you have ornlikes you get on each post defines who you are. I was also getting tired of seeing all my friends and peers around me already so successful in their lives. I’m nearly 20 and one of the very few people in my friend group who has a boyfriend or is engaged already. I’m still a baby, so I shouldn’t worry too much about that yet, but I live in a super LDS (Mormon) state so there is a lot of pressure to already have a significant other or be engaged.  I took a break from the university I attend, and now I don’t know what I’m going to study. I know what my mom wants me to study, but I don’t want to study that field because she wants me to and would take the credit for being right that I originally wanted to go into that career. It is something I’ve been wanting to study, but had originally been in a different major, but she told me to not be in that major because it’s not a good field for me. I want to stick with the original major just because she said that. It’s my life not hers, and that makes me mad that she’s telling me what I should do for the rest of my life. She’s only happy when I tell her that I’m doing everything she wants me to do. I’m no parent, but that’s not how to be a kind, loving, supportive parent. The school thing is very stressful. 

I wake up everyday and go to work. I have a very boring job that works perfectly with my schooling and pays well, but it makes me very depressed sometimes. After I get off from work, I go to my cold apartment bedroom, and often cry while listening to my music in the pitch dark. Then repeat this almost every day. 

I grew up very religiously, but now my family doesn’t practice religion very much anymore. This has been hard as it’s something I’ve needed in my life especially the past few years as they’ve been some very critical years so far in my life. It’s hard when I feel all alone but am often told there is someone always listening to my prayers if I’m willing to pray and open my heart to be able to listen back. I pray and have great things happen to me, but I pray other times and nothing happens or things seem to have gotten worse. Sure, you could say god has better timing for me or god has answered my prayers, or it could just be coincidental. I’m not shutting out the idea of a god, but I don’t know for myself, and that’s so hard. All my friends tell me their stories about how much god has helped them and how much love they have for god and because I don’t have the same experiences or feelings, I feel like I am sinning. I feel like I am sinning if I look into other religions as I’ve been told my religion is the correct and only correct religion and church to belong to so it’s scary thinking about even attending or looking into other religions. 

My parents divorced only a few months ago, and that’s been hard for my entire family as there are still little kids at home. The entire year of 2018 I had multiple friends and extended family members pass away. More than one of these passings was caused due to a friend taking their own life. For years, I have thought out and planned on how I would take my own life, and I won’t lie, I’ve told people I don’t want to live before, because it’s true. As twisted as this may seem, I feel as if I get them comfortable to hearing me speak this way of myself, that when I become brave enough, it will be less hard. 
How ive seen taking my own life, I have nothing to live for; we all die anyway. I might not ever graduate college and I’m probably wasting my time. I am too big and ugly for anyone to want to Mary me, so I won’t ever get married. I don’t even know if that’s what I want, but I don’t like being alone. Won’t ever have kids. I really hate myself. I wish I would lose weight. I wish I would dress nicer and wear makeup. I wish I could afford it. I really wish I wasn’t living, because I’m scared of the future that I don’t even have. 
I know people say that someone who wants to take their own life away doesn’t want to actually die, rather take their pain away. I actually want to die. I’m so anxious about everything that I don’t live my life to the fullest. I don’t let myself enjoy things as much  I’ve tried to allow myself, I just can’t. I’m worried of how I’d die naturally that I’d rather just take my own life when, and where I’d like to. I haven’t because I know it will be painful, and more painful if I’m not successful at it. I have to make sure I’d be successful at it, but as much of a failure that I am, I fear I’d fail at that, and not be able to succeed how I wish. I think about it daily, I’d be sad to not see my friends or family, but I see them now and I still hurt inside anyway, so this way, I’d be gone. I also don’t know where my spirit would go afterwards if it goes anywhere. I’m just in the same spot in my life everyday. Most everyone thinks I’m so happy, but really, I think because I’ve been extremely open about not wanting to live and how depressed I actually am that people disregard it and think it’s for attention. Nobody believes me because of how often and many people who would like to suffer with a mental illness to receive attention from others. So when people who really suffer are open about it, sometimes others overlook them because they don’t know what to believe. It’s hard to know that some people I’m sure think I want attention like some others, but I don’t. I just want to not be the broken mess I am anymore. That’s all I want. 
Im scared to talk to my mom, because she deals with people close to my age who are going through the same things.

Last year when my family found out I was cutting, they all changed how they acted around my like I was a fragile piece of glass. My younger sister worries a lot about me and I feel like I stress her out whatever I do. If I leave a family event early, she thinks I’m going to hurt myself. I’ve told her not to worry, but I worry for myself sometimes. I just don’t want to be here anymore and I feel my time here is almost up.

hey,"hey, I am new here. I decided today to join because yesterday my friends and my sister saw some of my self-inflicted scars and cuts and they made me promise that I would no longer do them again. however, here I find myself because I cannot do this. I have done my best not to think of it all day, but I am feeling terrible and I feel as if I need to cut myself, for it has always helped in the past. 
anyways, I don't really want to bother you all with this, just wondering if anyone had any tips to think of something else and maybe take it off my mind. 
I'm really grateful.",depression
Coming off meds after over a decade,"Hello all:
A long-time member here, but I haven't been on in quite a while. I'm looking for a little feedback/advice on my current situation:
For well over a decade, I have been on a combination of Wellbutrin (bupropion) and Celexa (citalopram), which has more or less been working, depending on how you define ""work"". Late November my PCP has taken me off the Celexa, in order for me to take hydroxyzine for anxiety (drug interaction). I thought I was doing pretty well, since it has been a couple of months now, but just in the past couple of weeks I have been doing a lot of crying. Before, it was very difficult for me to cry at all. Little things will remind me of lost loved ones, or other triggers, and I'll well up with tears and go into a crying jag. A couple of days ago I was crying to the point of me literally collapsing. It's all too much for me.
So now I'm wondering if I should be back on the Celexa, or perhaps start a new med. I was prescribed the hydroxyzine for anxiety, at my request, so that I would not longer be on benzodiazepenes. I don't know which way to turn.
If anyone has had similar experiences, or would simply like to chime in, I'd like to hear from you. I'm unable to see a psychiatrist/psychologist because of insurance, so my PCP has just been prescribing the meds that I was already on before I started seeing him. It's only because of the interaction between Celexa and hydroxyzine that I have made this change.
If you've read this far, thank you for taking the time. I appreciate any feedback.

Paxil,"Is there anyone else who has had stomach issues when starting Paxil? I started on it last week and I've been nauseous with diarrhea ever since. Never had an issue with any other SSRI's. I'm just starting back on meds after being off for a year. Paxil is one of the few meds I haven't been on in the decades I've taken them. Already talked to the pharmacist and have a call in to my P-Doc. 
Was on Prozac many years, then it stopped working, same with Celexa. Others weren't effective and Wellbutrin gave me side effects so bad that I had to be weaned off of it.

****trigger warning***,"***********trigger warning*************
It has been a long time since I have been triggered like this. I have done very well when it comes to self injury. I have not cut since I found out of I was pregnant with Aiden, almost 3 years ago.
There has been some close calls, but I have always been able to prevent myself from going back on my word to my husband.
Tonight I went to go switch out the laundry and on the dryer was a blade, like the blades I use to use. I picked it up, and touched it, and so many things flash before my eyes.
I still remember how it feels, the pain, and then the huge release afterwards.
I didn't hurt myself, I put the blade down. But I would be lying if I said its not something that is on my mind, or its not something that I'm thinking about.
Addiction last forever, even in recovery. Its something that I will always struggle with, and I hope I will always have the strength to put the blade down.",depression
How do I support my very very depressed boyfriend,"Hello everyone I hope you are having a good night. I would love your thoughts on this...My partner is at the tail end of a series of extremely stressful life circumstances and events which have spanned the past few years. A 27 year marriage breakdown, depression anxiety, chronic back pain and PTSD from childhood and toxic workplace. He has gone from an executive level job to unemployed. He feel detached from his kids and is yet to settle properties with his estranged wife so housing stability is in the air. We are booked to go overseas on a holiday in 10 weeks for 1 month. It is his lifelong dream. However right now he is self isolating and isolating himself from me, he is extremly fragile and negative. We cant spend more than a few hours together and he wants to go home to be by himself whereas I just want to be with him eventhough his negativity brings me down! He keeps trying to sabotage our relationship by running away. He admits to that. I listen to him, stand up for him, give him thoughtful gifts, show him affection, make spending time with him my first priority. He does everything he can for me. Right now he has backed off again preffering to be by himself. He keeps doing this so I just let him be. I still msg him every day to check in but if he wants to be alone I let him be alone. I love him but I dont know if this is going to work out. Eventhough when circumstances are improving, his depression and anxiety doesnt.",depression

A Period period,"Let’s get visceral about viscera. I’m talking about the raw and bloody truth here. Periods SUCK! Almost as much as my knowledge on human anatomy and the English language. But seriously, I know I hate the whole sexist excuse of blaming a woman’s natural emotions on her lunar cycles. Even so, I find that around that time of the month I’m seriously SAD! Like moderate depression becomes so severe I can’t do much more than lie in bed and hate myself and my pained body sad. Recognizing that it’s emotions driven by my bitchy little ovaries doesn’t keep those emotions from being a hindrance either. Am I the only one who finds their functioning depression become not so functioning depression when Aunt Flo comes around? Is there anything to do about it?",depression
Sadness Vs. Depression,"I heard something on the radio awhile back that i wanted to share.  There was a program on grief and a therapist or somebody was talking about feeling badly.  She said that depression is a medical illness and is actually not that common.  The treatment for it is medication and therapy.  She said that most people are actually sad about something or multiple things and the treatment for that is human connection.
I thought that was very well put.  I guess it can be a fine line but I know that most of the time I have felt really bad, it's usually due to loneliness and lack of connection even if I am not aware of it at the time.  And then if someone can't find that connection they can start feeling worse and worse and then, for instance, might go to the doctor and be put on meds for depression which can actually mess with their heads even more.  And of course doctors aren't going to take the time to differentiate between sadness and depression, it's just easier for them to had out a med.
I wish the world was friendlier.  People on here seem much friendlier and more compassionate than the people in the real world.  Why is that?  Is it because here we are anonymous for the most part and so can let our guard down?  Or is it because we aren't actually presenting our real selves?  Just have some free time today and am rambling.  ",depression

My Job,"I left work crying last night, because I hate it there. I hate how negative the whole place is and how absolutely everyone trash talks everyone else behind their backs. I hate that we are always slammed with work and not enough bodies to finish everything, to the point where we can't get meds to the facilities in time. I hate that some people get promoted because they sleep with one of the pharmacists. I hate the egos that abound there. Fortunately for me, next week I will be starting in a different department there, with a pay increase to boot. But it can't come fast enough. I was so tired and burnt out and I literally left home in tears. I was still crying when I got home. Still crying as I took a bath (one of the only things that gives me peace and solace). I feel like people think I'm stupid there.. or maybe that's only me thinking that. Realistically, I realize that it was not my fault the deliveries were late, and that people are going to be petty and negative wherever I go. I think it's mainly that I am in such close proximity to them and their negativity that I soak that shit up and it has a very bad effect on me. Which means moving to a different department will be a very good thing for me. As for last night, I can try and apologize to the nice coworker that I got mad at. Or maybe give her some space at first and then apologize to her. I don't want to go into work today, but calling out sick when I'm not is not my style. I've thought of looking for a new job, but I just applied for benefits through my current workplace. Also, my plan was to stick it out for a few years (or until they fire me, whichever comes first). I've job-hopped so many times lately that this time, I need to stay. And it's the devil I know, and they know me. They appreciate me in their way. After all, if they didn't, they wouldn't be giving me a pay raise. Again, I'm trying... but when I come home crying and binge on chocolate peanut butter to make myself feel better (and I don't typically have a sweet tooth), that's a red flag to me. And this wasn't the first time either.",depression
Starting to feel overhelmed again,"Never tried one of these sites before but I feel like I really need to talk to somebody or just let it out.
First of I guess im gonna explain about it. Alot of things happened in the last few years so im gonna try and make it as short as possible sorry if it ends up long..




My girlfriend or rather ex girlfriend left me in september for another guy. She said it to me on cellphone after she ignored me for 2 whole weeks and getting mad at me each time I managed to contact her because I was really worried. It wasnt going that well its true but I think she cheated on me since literally right AFTER she broke up she was already with another guy. It affects me so much because shes my first girlfriend and the only person that appreciated me for who I am. To me she was truly very important... We went through alot and alot of things happened before we were even together...
Iv'e pretty much always been alone. Im from another country so many people were racist and mocking me about it. I ended up being with a group of ""friends"" a few years ago but I regret not leaving them earlier. They spent their whole free time at school watching girls asses so they can go and try to go out with them so they can fuck them... They were talking about it constantly. They also bullied a blind guy once which I really regret not defending him... I was scared of being alone at that time. She loved me at that time and I was constantly angry against everyone because I didn't like anyone at school in fact I hated almost everyone. So because of all my rage I released it on her when she was just trying to be nice to me so we stopped talking a while later... Then the next year I broke my right knee tendon really badly. After a 3 month break I got back to school and everyone kept leaving me behind since I was slower with my injury. It was at that point that I made up my mind and went on my own. I also got heartbroken by a girl that I loved but decided to give another chance to his ex. Then I learned that the girl that loved me was dating one of the perverted fucks of my old group. I was surprised and shocked. After I got heartbroken I changed alot. I understood what she must have felt and regretted it so much... I knew what the guy she was with was aiming for. He was always talking about these things so I knew it for sure. I wanted to talk to her again but I was afraid that shed hate me. But when we started talking again I learned that he...did things to her... or rather made her do things that she didn't even want to. That broke my heart even more because I had started having feelings for her. He broke up with her not long after and I kept telling her what kind of guy he was but she simply couldn't listen. She was blinded by her false love for him. She told me that he would only stay with her if she became his fuckfriend... I was nearly gonna beat the shit out of him but luckily I managed to convince her. And after our 2 years relation she left me like I explained earlier... I started feeling like before. Constantly alone, stressed out for no reason and can't stop thinking. I spent alot of nights just lying on my bed listening to music while watching the ceilling just thinking.  I took morphine and drank alot. And often cut my whole arm... I started thinking of committing suicide at some point... I had no motivation and didn't appreciate myself. I keep messing everything up... No mather how hard I try to be appreciated and no matter how nice I am  to others they simply don't care. At school they were mocking me each time they saw me. Throwing stuff at me in class. Writing shit about me on desks. Each time I talked about everything with someone they always said oh I understand you it will pass and just abandonned me like that. I feel like I am wasting my youth. At home we are having money problems and sometimes we don't even have food for a whole week. Currently I changed school to an adult school. At least the people there are better. But I keep feeling the same and can't stop thinking about her ! I changed schools to avoid all this and yet I keep feeling this way I simply can't handle all these feelings and thoughts anymore... I don't want alot of friends. But i'm just tired of constantly being alone and ashamed of myself. My fucking face. The few times someone said that im pretty to me its like an insult... Who should you believe. A few people or the whole world huh ? Im sick of feeling like this...
So thats it... Im even more ashamed of myself because I know there is worse than what im living... But these feelings just end up taking over you...",depression

Am I a horrible person?,"So I've struggled with depression and anxiety for the best part of 6 years now. I've came a long way since my failed suicide attempts and hospitalisation. But right now as I type this I have no job, my driving license has been revoked but the main thing that's bothering me now is that I feel I'm living a lie with my current gf. My marriage broke up this time last year and after months of crying myself to sleep I eventually found someone. Fast forward a few months and she became pregnant with my child. The thing is I feel so terribly guilty as I struggle to sleep at night thinking about my wife (I'm still technically married) and how much I still miss her. She had originally wanted a break but after a few months it became clear she didn't want me no more. I've struggled with this for ages now. My anxious mind now keeps playing tricks with me and I ask myself am I still in love with my wife? Do I love my gf? I know the most important thing in all of this our unborn child which I will love with all my heart of that I've no doubt but is it fair on my gf just to keep 'going through the motions'. I question myself all the time and still have suicidal thoughts from time to time. I've lost all confidence in myself and I've been putting off getting a job as my anxiety hits turbo when I think of having to work again. I KNOW suicide isn't an option I really don't wanna go down that path again but I'm struggling to make my own decisions am I being selfish for having feelings still? I'm due to see my psychiatrist again in a couple of weeks so I'll be sure to speak it over with him. Thanks for reading, much love cheers.",depression
Crisis Text Line,"Lately, I have had moments later in the evening when I get really depressed and then it escalates to the point of feeling like I'm gonna end up in the hospital.  A lot of it has to do either with being single, the winter weather and darkness, or just happens.  I use crisis text line because I can text instead of talk to someone over the phone.  But the last three times I TRIED using it, I had over an HOUR WAIT to talk to someone.  I don't know how I made it through it because I was at my limit of what I can take and after a while I gave up and texted ""stop"" to end it.  I dont know what's going on right now with the text line!? Is it not active or something?  Of course, I was able to calm down after an hour but still, I would've been in serious trouble if I didn't.  It's a good thing my therapist I see in person will allow me to make appointments besides my weekly one, for when things like this pop up. ",depression

Never being enough/happy,"Hey guys,
So recently in my life I've felt like no matter what I do there is always someone doing more or someone happier than me. I have always had this thought in the back of my mind but it's only until recently has it been effecting me mentally. Currently I am going to college and I don't see how this life of studying and test taking will really lead to a happy life. I can see how college can lead to a successful life, but happiness seems to be absent from the equation of my life decicons.

New Prescription,"Hello Everyone,
I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a long time now and finally decided to do something about it.  I made an appointment to consult a physician and went in for the appointment yesterday.  The doctor gave me a few referal to see specialists for other health related issues, as well as psychiatry.  It is going to be a 6 week wait for a visit with a psychiatrist, so the doctor prescribed me an antidepressant while I wait to be seen.
I have been taking Cymbalta for the last two days and I feel weird.  I feel a little depersonalized, nasueas, and wired.  I called the doctors office to ask if this is normal and if I should continue taking the medicine, but I didn't recieve a call back.  If anyone has any insight I would appreciate the feedback.  I am not asking for medical advice, I understand I need to speak to a professional.  I would just like to here from anyone that may have some experience that could give me some insights.  Thanks.",depression
Can't stop crying....,"Have been feeling more and more depressed the past several days. Feeling physically unwell for months(won't go into detail) and still don't know what's going on. Had lab work, etc, cardiologist sent me for stress test to make sure it was not another blocked artery..... PCP recommmended an endocrinologist but can't get in to see one until the beginning of March!! As I've said before I'm so damn frustrated because most days I don't feel up to doing anything or going anywhere. Don't get to see friends very often, especially since I moved last summer. Feel more isolated. Feel like my whole personality has changed. I used to be bubbly and outgoing and I'm not anymore. 
Yes, I have a therapist I see on a regular basis, with calls inbetween if needed. Hadn't been on antidepressants in over a year; for a while didn't need them but went yesterday for new prescription. Will be starting Paxil today. Hope it works because I can't stand feeling like this anymore. I'm limited as to what I can take. Was on Prozac for years and did great until it stopped working, as well as the same with Celexa. Tried other meds, including Zoloft and Effexor which didn't work. Wellbutrin gave me really bad side effects. Can't do any of the newer drugs because of cost(I'm on Medicare) and because of potential interactions with other prescriptions I'm on.
I've been crying off and on the last few days because I'm just so tired and tired of feeling so lousy. I want to be able to get out and do things, go places, but most days just can't.

Not good enough...,"I've been having a very hard time with guys... been treated not so nicely.. I had one who I have no recollection of talking to say my personality is terrible, and that I wouldn't find anyone to date me.. also that I was flaky and dumb.. I was going to meet another guy for dinner, but I texted to ask him if we could change it cause I couldn't afford it at the moment and I would have to wait till I got paid next time.. Than he says something that really got me too.. he told me he wasnt really intrested anyways, and that's why he hadn't texted me since yesterday.. and also said he could see why the other guy didnt want to date me.. I know its probably dumb to get upset over because I dont know them but hearing those things really really hurt and honestly felt my self esteem and confidence go down the drain... It made me feel worthless and that nobody would ever want me around.. I can't explain how these comments made me feel but it made me want to end things right there because they made me believe I wasnt good enough... its really affected me especially the words, and thinking that's what people really thing of me...

It's just another day!!!!,"Hi
I'm new to this site but not new to depression. I have spent some time reading many of your posts and the pain you are feeling, especially this time of year. But can I humbly please say...It's just another day. 
I know that many hurt from loss or loneliness and can i start by honestly saying Happy New Year! I myself spent mine alone in the litreal middle of nowhere staring at a Oil well. I had a bit of hope that at 11:58 when i pulled up to the well another truck was there and i thought I'd at LEAST get to say 'Happy New Year' to SOMEONE, but the guy just got in his truck and drove away! But it did make me think why it was so important just to say it and just to hear it. That little shake of myself probably really helped. Instead of saying i am alone, i have no one while others i know do, remebering New Years past and wondering about tommorrow and if it can get worse. I just shrugged and said it's just another day. 
But also i saw the incredible value of communication. I was still depressed but that little bit pulled me through and got me to realize i needed help to improve this year so that my chances of having a better 2020 New year are better. So I got up, called a therapist and made an appointment, then found this sight to start communicating with others. I read many of your posts and replied where i felt i could speak. Many others, just reading gave me a better understanding I am not alone and GOOD PEOPLE, yes, you are good people who need a little help at times and are compassionate enough to give it. 
So I want to create a new holiday for us...Happy 'It's just another day' and on this holliday, Janurary 2nd. the tradition is to just tell a joke to someone and get a laugh. so my joke is..
What did the fish say when he hit the wall.....Damn!
Please feel free to post your joke... i really like to laugh",depression
My solace,"I love the rain so much, it gives me a sense of solace.  Does anyone else feel the same or have something else that gives them peace when they are feeling stressed or uneasy?  I dont know what it is but I've always found instant comfort in the sound of raindrops hitting outside, or just water in general for some reason and it's been that way since I can remember.   I love the feel of warm water like feeling my feet under the faucet of a hot bath, or just standing in a hot shower.  Does anyone else have something they do that's self therapeutic like that to relieve anxiety and stress?  ",depression
The worst epidemic of all- 'free' time,"Our ancestors used to get up before the sun and go to bed long after it went down. Used to walk up hill (Both ways!) in the snow and rain combined together. Worked thier fingers to the bone then to the palm and finally to the wrist. Slept six-in-a-single-bed with one blanket at the bottom of the lake and ate gravel for breakfast!!!(Monty python lol) It's true, ask anyone over 50.
But in all honesty we now live in a life that for the first time we have a new epidemic hurting us. Time to ourselves and not knowing what to do with it. for some this can cause anxiety of such freedom, yes i said freedom. i another post i quotes a great in Kirkegaard 'Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom'. think of it, for many the anxiety is caused by actually having to make a difficult choice and a lock up in fear of it. In depression it's that free time we reflect back on ourselves and through rose colored glasses criticize what we see. looking at life like a video game where we 'win' it and realize were no better off than we were before and how useless that last 3 days have been (never did that before). 
For the first time in history has a society had actually TIME. Not hunting the mamoth and running away if your spear missed. Not toiling the fields so your family could eat at night. Not learning a valuable trade handed down from your mother or father to knit or sew, to repair a broken toy or fix a flat tire. And this same society is trying to find ways to give us MORE TIME by creating computers to do our jobs...but taking our income so we have even less with the more it gives us.
It is a society geared toward someone elses idea of success. a success that gives them more money to 'spend' on that free time. but for many of us here this society cannot understand us and the damage it causes by giving more time and less life. And we cry out to friends, family, and loved ones to help but they don't see blood or broken bone and don't understand the pain we feel. Our affliction then shackel us in a solitary confinment with all this time staring us in the face witha scowl.
But there is hope and it's behind the eyes reading this. For this 'time' is only a illusion and once we see the paper tiger has no teeth we can overcome. the cell door is shut but it cannot lock, you heros will have to show your strength to stand and walk out. I cannot tell you how to stand but that you CAN stand. so if you have time to spare start first of all by finding something to help you stand and show your time isn't free but precious

What’s it going to take before someone listens...?,"i feel like I’m shouting from the rooftop IM NOT OK HELP ME. But no one is listening no one cares no ones gives a fuck. I tell them the horrid stories I’ve been through and no one does anything what is fucking wrong with people? Why does no one fucking care?

is it just me? Am I actually the problem here? Maybe I should just end my misery so I don’t have to feel this shitty and alone all the time.",depression
College App & parents problem,"

I’m currently senior in high school, on my 6th year living in USA, and having difficult time applying for college because of my citizenship status and my parents aren’t willing to help me at all.
my parents wants me to finish my high school education here then go to college in my home country Japan because the current visa will expire this year.
Mean while I want to get a new visa and stay here. I personally feel like The education, getting jobs, diversity, people here are better and suit my personality better. Although I told my parents many times that I really love the environment here and I want to continue staying here for college, they keep saying no because they can’t afford it and I’m not special enough that any of the college would want time or even get a job. I do understand that there are many risks for applying for colleges in country that I don’t have my citizenship, i don’t even know if I get any financial supports because I’m not eligible for FAFSA. For that reason I’ve been trying my best to talk to my parents, and do my best to make myself for a better status to apply. 
However, I think the biggest problem here is that my parents are not willing to communicate with me at all. They are DEFINITELY NOT the peaceful people to talk to. Means they are extremely bad tempered, they can easily get angry and violent, even without any proper reason. I have been always scared of them since I was little even though I can talk back to them a little but I can’t argue them because many times I tried, the more I got hurt. Even when I just Disagreed with them because I simply had a different idea and wanted to know their perspective, I’m not allowed to disagree with them, they told me. So when I try to talk to them about college, all they do is just tell me that I can’t, I just have to go back to my home country(which I NEVER wanted), I used up all their money, I’m dumb and worth nothing. I do admit some of the things they say is true; but these aren’t the helping the situation. I feel like they don’t even try to help me if there’s any other way, or even give me any help to find out what I can do Disregarding which country.
The current conclusion is im going to continue working on my application only the part that I can take care of(getting family infos, essay and supplements), and convince my parents to get me student visa(I think that’s they only way), and if I still couldn’t apply then I will take a gap year or semester just give more time to figure this out.
I don’t just want to stay here to get myself a student loans slowly killing me. When I just moved here 6years ago, It took me some effort to get use to and to open my mind to the new environment. And most importantly I made numerous valuable experiences and sacrifices. I don’t want to lose them all now and I want to continue learning in this country. And I don’t even want to live with my parents anymore because they probably only care about if I go to famous colleges or how much money I make, or thinks it’s ok to hurt me physically or emotionally or don’t accept my opinions just because they are superior. I don’t respect/even want people like them to be my parents, I always feel simply disappointed and upset whenever my friends talking about their proud/happy family stories.
I feel just fears. I have no clue what to do. I don’t know if I should just give up my dream and just do what my parents say(because it’s the “correct way” according to them) and don’t risk it, or fight for it and be responsible for all the risk I take.
Thank you for reading my post, I know I wrote unnecessarily dramatic stories here but it did take me a lot to come out. If anyone is familiar with foreign citizenship, international admission process for colleges, I would really appreciate it if you can help me. Thank you.",depression
Perinatal post partum depression,"Not sure if there is a perinatal depression support group but hopefully I can find some help here. I have always had anxiety, PTSD, depression but it had never been severe until 2 years after having my first daughter. She just turned 4 and I felt like I was just barely managing it when I found out I was pregnant again. I feel very alone as my family has never been close or supportive of me and ive never felt this anxious and depressed before. I was taking xanax but when I found out I was pregnant switched to buspar. Can't tell if it's helping or not. I feel like I could barely take care of one and feel stupid and I'll prepared to take care of another. Any kind words or relatable advice would be helpful.

The Queen of Sheba,"Hi, I am sorry but i just wanted to show you a picture of a very powerful woman that I am working on. This Is Makeda, The Queen of Sheba as you know her from the Bible. I Really enjoy the works of Solomon in the Bible and researched her. She was the warrior-queen of the lands we now know as Yemen and Etheopia. The stories say she came out of the desert and forged a great kingdom to the south. It was said her wisdom rivaled that of Solomon himself and the stories of thier 'debates' are wonderful. Her ancestrial line was boasted all the way down to 1970 as direct decendants of her blood and her kingdom followed in the line of both Jew and Gentile as many fled to this land after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem around 70 AD.
Like many of you, she came from nowhere and from nothing, yet by her hand and heart built herself into a queen of great stature and a empire that lasted longer than Rome. 'Blessed is those of pure heart, for they shall see God' Who says there arent great women in the Bible.

Help,"It is my first day back at school after Christmas break. The break was really...eventful to say the least. In one of my previous posts, I talked about how my older brother scared me due to things I found on his laptop. Well, on Christmas Eve, my anger and anxiety got the best of me and I yelled at my brother and I ended up slapping him across the face.
Well, so far, my first day back has been stressful. I had homework that I forgot to catch up on because of my anxiety and also family gatherings. My teachers are expecting a lot from me and I can't seem to live up to those expectations. I've had to email teachers and give a vague explanation of things that have been going on.

Extreme emptyness,"Alex Manadragon:
There's nothing left to fill my nearly empty life.  My extended family all have lives, jobs, homes, and relationships of their own so I never see them anymore, my mother is finally going through a midlife crisis and is becoming forgetful; it looks similar to onset dementia and she may have carcinomas.  My father is becoming more annoying, impatient, and grumpier with time and his mother had Alzheimer's so he may be developing it as well.  If my mother is prone to cancer, like her extended family, and my father is prone to Alzheimer's then I may develop those later in life.  My father is becoming forgetful too.  My mother and father no longer like each other, they literally have nothing but children in common.  I've never had any true friends throughout my entire life, I have remained lonely and have appeared awkward to many as I have ASD and clinical depression.  Cute things make me cry, I envy every furry because they have amazing fursuits, are laid more often, have friends and enjoy each other's company especially at conventions and meetups, they get around and travel more while I'm stuck local to my state.  I see people in relationships all around me and it upsets me to the point where I feel like I slip into a catatonic state.  Also, I envy their artwork, no matter the artist, because it always looks perfected, is higher quality, and more expensive unlike mine.  I feel like I'm the wrong species as I feel like I can't handle human problems and responsibilities along with not fitting in anywhere.  I can't afford, have, nor take care of pets I would like to have to comfort me.  I also envy furries because having lots of excellent artwork and fursuits prove they get, keep, and have jobs far easier especially higher paying jobs and better education, which I can't afford nor have the will to carry out.  I can't get jack dittly squat from job applications and interviews.  I'm stuck with my 18 hours/week minimum wage job.  They are less likely to hire depressed, autistic people anyway.  My hobbies are too expensive so I either use money to survive but be bored or use it to have fun but be homeless and starving.  My youngest sister has hit puberty and is going through problems herself such as the onset of the feeling of arousal, periods, depression, mood swings, detachment.  My oldest sister is secluded and we don't communicate much, she prefers the internet.  I've tried making online friends but they never feel real as I can never see them nor meet them to hang out with them.  They are only digital, not physical.  I'm stuck in the middle of all of this.  I feel over self-conscious so I see myself as desperate, needy, whiny, petty, insensitive, which people in the past have called me.  Why am I?  I don't know.",depression

Holiday Blues,"Hi Everyone,
I am just reaching out for some love and support. This is my first winter and holiday season single in about 6 years. As much as I am trying to focus on me and what makes me feel good, it's been a lot harder than I could prepare myself for. As I mentioned in a few previous posts, my ex ended things quite suddenly with me in April. While it has been 8 months, it still feels so incredibly fresh. I have been on Lexapro for about 5 weeks now, and I think it is helping but this past week, I feel the anxiety and sadness rushing back. Work is a bit slower, and I have had too much time to think about everything. I am trying to put myself out there by volunteering and reaching out to people that I don't have the strongest friendship with, but I enjoy being around, but it feels like a lot of effort. Sometimes I wonder if people want to hang out, and if they would ever reach out to me if I didn't initiate the plans. 
I am doing my best to put myself out there, to continue working out and eating healthy, but today I feel so down and in my head. Looking for someone to remind me that things will be okay, and that I will find love again. Being single and alone is truly so hard to learn how to do after so many years of having that best friend to share everything with.",depression

Third, on the 23, 24 AND Christmas, I had panic attacks and self harm urges. I didn't know why the urges happened but they did. Something I'll have to make sure to tell Meredith about. After all, therapists can't help you unless they know what's going on in your life.

Love and depression,"Hi.  New here. A little about me in a brief version. I've had depression since age 14. At least that's when I first remember it.  have 2 sons college and high school, I am single.  I haven't dated in 4 years by choice.  I was making some not so smart choices and decided to take time for myself. I learned a lot about myself in the past 4 years. I also learned to love myself and hold myself in high regards.  
This year I've been trying different meds because Paxil was causing muscle aches really badly. So now I'm on the lowest dose of Lexapro for 2 months and no more pain. I feel like meds only take the edge off the sadness that depression brings.  
I decided during the summer that I was ready to date in hopes of finding love again. I've turned many men down in recent years, marriage proposals, you name it, because I just wasn't interested in them. Well I met someone and he just does it for me.  He tells me he cares so damn much for me however he seems to have a lot going on in his life right now so I don't get to see him often but he likes to text constantly. He calls when he doesn't hear from me to find out if all is ok.  I back off because it hurts to care for someone so much and you don't get the time in person to get to know them better, to help the relationship grow.
So my heart hurts and I feel sadness.  This is not the feeling I was hoping for when I meet someone I want to be with. I know I deserve to be one of his top priorities and if I'm not I'm willing to walk away. But why does it hurt so bad?  I want a love that brings joy not sadness.  
Is this part of my depression?
There's lots I left out so let me know if you need more info and I will feel in the blanks.

Lowest point in my life.,"So here it is Christmas day and I am in a hotel as the police have sent me away from my brother and his girl friend as we had a massive argument.

Dilemma...,"I need your advice. So I've had this wonderful boyfriend for more than two years. Boyfriend now but we started out as pen pals. Back then I was just looking for a friend and he became that to me and more.
My mum is really concerned for a number of reasons which she pointed out to me and now I'm having some doubts. I normally manage to excuse them in my head but today I decided to try to look at it objectively.
For starters he's blind. But he still seems so capable and I think he can do whatever he puts his mind to. Except drive, but that's cool.
But then... His mom is old and he lives with her and they're kinda looking afrer each other. I know I'll seem heartless but I don't want to have to be a caregiver when I get married. And I'll seem mean if I insist she can't stay with us.
Then his brother has a mental problem that means he can't stay on his own. So basically they're taking care of him too. So that will be caregiver times 2 (See? I already sound heartless just for having the thought).
Then I'm a continent away. My whole family is here and I don't wanna leave them. But I go to him, I feel like I won't have a support system behind me. Strange land, new people, different culture, and am all alone and I'm prone to depression (self-diagnosed) and I think I'd find it hard to cope. But to ask him to come here... Where I live it can be hard for a blind person to get around and get a job and stuff.
There's this time when I was in a bit of a financial bind and I really really needed some cash. And he wasn't the first person that came to mind. But when I exhausted all other options that's when I asked him for help. He said okay. I can have it to you in two days. Two days became five then a week and then a month... And he kept saying itsi cause he's blind he can't figure out how to do the transaction. Which might be true but I also think it was an excuse. And I don't like being lied to. And I feel like if it ever came to a point where I don't have food in the house or can't pay rent that month or something and I need help (and I always pay back) he wouldn't care.
So now I feel like I'm gonna have to make all these sacrifices and I am trying to think of any sacrifice he'll be making for me and I can't think of any. But on the other hand if I break things off... What if it's a mistake and I lose my best friend?
I'm sorry this was so long. I tend to ramble. Thanks for reading if you've gotten to the end. Any advice would be helpful. And please be honest (but not mean) as this is really stressing me and I want to make the right decision regarding the way forward.",depression

making changes,"Sometimes it's really hard to make changes, and I think when getting depressed that at times it's difficult to change patterns, especially relational patterns.  It took me decades to realize that a relationshp with my family was not going to work out.  It's weird, now that christmas is here, not to be spending it with them, who knows if if I will hear from them or not.  It took a few hospital stays and a suicide attempt to realize that it was now I who was ruining my life, rather than them, because I was allowing them to viciously abuse me.
It's paradoxical to come to the realization, that unless you are a minor, when you are being abused, the reality is that just by sticking around and even attempting to play the game at all, you are now, amazingly, abusing yourself.  It's impossible to see this at the time, due to being in the spinning vortex of chaos, but in retrospect it becomes clear.  This is not to imply to anyone who is being abused that they are doing it to themselves or that it's deserved, but at least in terms of myself I now see it differently.  I think, like the crab in hot water, we are conditioned from childhood, if we were abused in childhood, that this is it and it's the only way it is.  It's no wonder people stay.  After all, childhood is a time of intense programming, right?  Who is more impressionable and easy to control than a child. Therefore it follows that if from say the age of 3 or 4, you are physically and emotionally wracked with this kind of treatment it seems damn near impossible to change.  Note that I said ""near impossible,"" not ""impossible.""  You would think that you'd walk away from abuse as an adult since you know so much about it, but the sick irony is that an unhealed past lets us stay trapped there. So, when running into similar personalities, there is either fight or flight, or just plain old freeze, which has been a default for me.
Not now.
I made a few changes, and while they are seemingly small, I actually think they are pretty big. For instance, my doctor was acting like a jerk, ok, an asshole, and making the visits very difficult. After leaving the office crying a few times, I thought, ""Why do I keep going to this doctor? Am I afraid of him? Yes, I am. I'm afraid of his anger and the fact that he seems like he is ""right"" all the time.  Well, screw this. There are other doctors. I called the office and while they didn't like it and perhaps thought I was a bit cray because I was emotional, I explained that I am the patient and I'm dependent on the  doctor for renewal of prescriptions, that I can't function without it, so therefore it should not be an ordeal to get what I need, and could I be switched to someone who is a better fit. They probably didn't like it but they switched me.  I'm getting along with the new person much better.  It was awkward when I ran into him at the office, but guess what life goes on.  
The same with being uncomfortable with a group of friends.  I did not know why I was uncomfortable, I just knew that I was.  I supposed that I could have analyzed it relentlessly, like I did when I was trying to control the alcoholic in my life, but that only gets you so far. ""What's the hook?"" I asked myself. The hook was that I was afraid to be alone, just like I feared that when cutting ties with the family. I dealt with severe mistreatment due to the fear of being alone (which is not to be underestimated).  And I just realized that it was similar here.  I just said, ""same thing, different situation, different day,"" I will walk-even if just for now.
This I think is much better in the long run. You can analyze how to change the lightbulb all damn day or just change the**** lightbulb.  And it's a whole lot less depressing than getting endlessly stuck.

should I?,"I mean i think i should because this time I actually took time to write a note.  It's short, but get a few of the reasons why out of the way.  They always say that a note leaves more than it answeres, but how do you get around that?  You don't.  I wrote what i wanted and now i can go out.  What really is the best way or easiest?  There is no best or easiest way.  I do have a gun now.  I was able to save up 500$.  Who knew these damn things were so expensive?!  Especially, when you know a guy who brags about the new gun he bought every few weeks.  I bought a 380(Three-Eighty) is what the guy behind the cunter kept calling it.  Surprisingly easy to buy one in the states.  i thought it was weeks of background checks and other stuff, but nope.  10-20min later I was walking out with it.  I wanted to do it in the parking lot since i bought bullets on the way out, but figured why cause them the issue of cleaning me up.  After i arrived home it didn't make any sense about where I did it...then outdoors would probably be best as it would be easier to clean up.  I thought about doing it at a national park sonce Colorado is FULL of them, but cant choose which one since they're all so beautiful... also not wanting some random ranger finding me, but probably better them than some random hiker.  I guess i'll go browse a few more parks...maybe some that are more remote.",depression

When...,You know when the world seems to be crashing around you in slow motion. It sucks when you can't seem to do anything to stop it. To reverse it. To slow it down. To fix it. When you see your family that doesn't see you. Or when you see people you wish you could save. But turns out you just can't find some of the people that need it most before it's too late. When the ones that seem to have it the best cry themselves to sleep. Or when the laughter is the only thing hilding back their tears. I knew someone like that. He was everything to me. But he threw it away. When the ones you love most don't love themselves enough. The missed calls you assumed were telemarketers. When you realized you were focusing so much on yourself and the things that don't truly matter instead of him. When you are thinking so much about how lost and alone you feel you miss the pain and fear that was in his eyes. His eyes...the ones I didn't see when I neede too but now I can't see them at all. When you think there is nothing you can do...then you realized there were so many things. Things that you miss. When you finally understand that the one time you don't get up to see why it's ringing...the one time it matters. You couldn't have known they say but I should've known. I should've recongnized the specific ringtone he picked...he picked because for some strange reason it reminded him of the beach. Just a simple ring but an important and beutiful one. When you realize too late that telemarketers don't call at a time like that. When you realize that they don't call twice in a row before stopping...they call once. When you can't look people in the eye anymore because you know the truth. You know that something could have been done. Three steps...1...2...3...and there my one was. When you know that you were three steps away yet you layed still waiting for it to stop ringing. When you kow you are waiting for the person to give up...and that is just what happend...indirectly what I wanted. I wanted to sleep my troubles away. When you know that your short sleep created an indefinent one. You know what you did..or in better terms what you failed to do. When you realize you confirmed his false truth that no one cared. When that's all you ever did...when that is all you ever do...when that is all you ever will do. But now he will never know. When you realize that you will live your life knowing you killed him. I did. He needed me and I did nothing. I couldn't have known? Well that is where your wrong. I could have but did I know? No. When you realize you have killed the one you love most. When you are tired but are afraid to sleep. Afraid to let someone else down. Who really gave up the person that did so cause he thought no one cared or the person that proved him right?,depression
Why don't I die instead ?,"My life seriously has zero purpose. I hear all these stories about people dying that are mothers, fathers, grandparents, teachers, doctors, etc. Basically people with a purpose. People that are important. I have nothing absolutely nothing. Why do they die instead of me ? Give me the cancer or kill me in the car accident instead of them. My entire life has been  depression episodes. I'm tired of struggling. If I can't just be normal i would rather not be alive at all. U kno? Just save one of their lives and take mine so all my pain n suffering can end by natural causes since I could never commit suicide, natural causes would be the only way to end this all. ",depression

Wasting Time,"I just spent the last 45 minutes wasting time on YouTube. It sounds simple enough... I love checking out new music videos, and every now and then a 20-30 min. video of behind the scenes or music/concert shorts. Tonight, I just watched videos of nothing. They served no purpose, no value, and I couldn't believe how much time went by. I work a very technical job. We work with a lot of clients, and sometimes we are working up until the last minute in stressful situations. I think today was one of those days where I wanted to come home and unwind, not think, and just relax. I feel like I just wasted so much time. It's such a small concern, and I know there are bigger problems out there. But I just wish I could spend my time in a better way. I do some freelance work outside, but sometimes on a night like tonight, I just veg out. Just needed to vent a little bit and get past the fog.",depression
Not being able to see or be apart of my child.,"About 6 years ago I left my daughter's mother.  Ever since then I have been only allowed to see her at most 8 times.

Not exactly sure how to handle my emotions about all of this",depression
GOD is unfair!!!!!!!,"
I will try and be brief….as possible….
I have battled depression ALL of my life!!!! (now 51…) Been on EVERY anti depressant under the sun…(I have Chronic Depression) been to 21 different mental health…”so-called professionals”…who did nothing but charge me mega $$$$$$ and use their stupid CBT techniques…(CBT is insane! It takes AWAY from your issues instead of helping them! Their theory is:  “Well…you are burning up=literally---no help available…but it is drizzling rain—so focus on that…) I have been Inpatient twice---due to two suicide attempts…
 I hate life and I hate myself! Always have on both counts!
 One main issue is:  I tried for ages to build a nice body—I worked out…ate right---had a trainer….even did steroids (which messed me up more) and NEVER could “get there”!!! Google of Greg Valentino or Ronnie Coleman….this is “the look” I so wanted….but could not get!
 Since a child…I have ALWAYS wanted to look like someone else…ANYONE else but ME! I always see other guys who have “the look” and I have crap! I am ashamed to take my clothes off and shower….and even more ashamed to be seen in public with clothes on!!!! It is a disgrace and an embarrassment to have been born like this! My face is also riddled with acne scars….
 
 You know…all other guys…. …have muscles…thick hair-----they party thru college (I worked my way thru) and when they get out..Boom! They get opportunities slung at them! The crap that comes so easily for others never even happened for me…in spite of all my wasted effort, time, and energy!!!
 Every female I have been in a relationship with…I felt inadequate/insecure/unworthy…and when we would go out and I would see a guy who has “the look” I could sense she wanted him……Face is acne scar ridden----But I know my lot in life is to make others feel good about who they are
 Please I do not want to hear personality matters---tried that----I have learned to accept being alone---just cannot accept why life gave me such a raw deal……..
Please no bs about ""well I have other gifts"" NO I do not! 

Besides--I have had to suffer thru with this body---why could I not ever make it acceptable? Why do other guys attain what I NEVER could!!!!!! Heck I do not/never did want a million bucks or to be rich and famous---just self esteem filled-----but as I said, no such luck.......
My only thing that keeps me going--is I am 51 now---so my ""sentence"" here on Earth is at least 80% over---hopefully more!!! It will be completely over when I've reached my limit (fyi see my last journal post----)",depression
Depressed and miserable,"Hello, I am new here...
With my Depression, everyday is a struggle for me. From the moment I wake up, throughout the whole day and night.
I feel like my life is going downhill, and not much to look forward to in the future when ill-health and loneliness will take hold.
I am a single mom with 2 kids, son is 23 and daughter 21 years old. It has always been the three of us, and we are close with each other. I know that sooner or later, I will be an Empty Nester, and when that time comes, I will be devastated and miserable.
I can't do much about all of these, and am sad and lonely all the time. I feel I have lost all interest in things that I used to enjoy.
Can I get some advice from anyone, as to how I can be happy and motivated again?",depression
In this horrible rut again,"I'm 52 years old. Almost 4 weeks ago I woke up with awful vertigo. Room was spinning. Really really scared the crap out of me.  Turned out that I have BPPV, nothing serious. They treated it with physical therapy, and it's pretty much resolved. 
BUT the fear and anxiety about what the hell it was triggered me and now I'm in this awful rut of extreme morning anxiety and depression every day. This is my 4th major depression (MD).
I'm on the highest dose of Zoloft. My Psych gave me Buspar a few days ago but I haven't taken it yet.  I use a low dose of Valium each morning just to deal with the anxiety (I know the risks with it).
Previous episodes of depression were triggered by pregnancy, Prednisone, and I'm not sure what triggered the 3rd episode  
My question is has anyone else had a MD episode triggered by a really frightening event???",depression
Mail carrying blues,"I'm a mail carrier.  We are used to dealing with all kinds of sh*t, believe me.  The most recent, tho, is pretty weird and bad.  The new head postmaster general is making changes to undermine our organization and our ability to get your mail to you in a timely way, not to mention putting the carriers in harms way.  One way he is doing the latter is to change our start time to 8:30 a.m.  This is an outrageouly late start time for us.  Usually we start at around 7 to 7:30 a.m. because it takes time to get our mail, get out of the office, get the mail to you, etc.  Most of the routes are very long.  This is especially bad in summer because we can't ""beat the heat"" as well because we are starting later and in the winter it is bad because we are out there longer in the dark.
It's very depressing to have your boss forcing you into harm's way, making your job harder and making customer service worse.  I gripe a lot about my job, it is hard and a lot of the managers suck but I do take pride in my job.  Been doing it a long time.  I do care if people get their mail and get it in a timely way.  We deliver checks, birthday cards, meds, voter's ballots, tons and tons of packages, not to mention a friendly word to the lonely people out there who wait for their mail as the one of the highlights of their day.  Lots of dogs love us or love to hate us too.
This makes me really sad.  I don't think the postal service will ever fall completely, at least not in the near future because we are so tightly woven into the fabric of the American life.  But it sucks to have to deal with this kind of crappy corruption.  The mail carriers and clerks and mail handlers work really hard and we don't deserve to be treated like this.  We do all kind of dangerous and hard things on a daily basis just to get our jobs done and we deserve respect.  I think most Americal people understand what's going on but I wanted to write about this anyway.  
This new postmaster general is really corrupt so if you get your mail late or it's delayed, it's most likely his fault.  Yea, we make mistakes but I've never known a postal employee who was purposely trying to undermine service to the American people like this guy is.  It's shameful.  
There, I've said my peice.  I probably won't be with this job much longer anyway but I needed to get this out there.
Thanks for listening to my rant.",depression
I always feel fake,"been going through a lot of websites lately trying to find some type of support group because im in another one of my lows. With covid and everything I cant see my therapist in person. I can zoom but since i barely talk to her during our sessions to begin with because my anxiety, i havent brought myself to talk to her again yet. My meds seems to be wearing off, as if im getting too used to them. Too bad im maxed out on them looks like im going to have to move onto another one, so great. Last few days ive been pretty out of control feeling numb yet having outbursts of anger then crying for hours. Its been awhile since ive had these outbursts for an extended amount of time all at once. But anyway I just feel like such a fake person, I lie to everyione about how i feel because i dont actually know the answer either. In front of my friends im so happy, beyond happy. But the moment i hit my bed I feel so exahusted from all the lies and fake attitude I snap. Hate feeling like crap yet numb all day, somtimes i wish I got one of those bad diseases because someone who wants to live more then me dosent deserve to have it. Idk just something i feel guilty for but anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far sorry my grammar is a mess I dont sleep much unless I take my sleeping pills which also sucks cause i dont like starting another day over again just to feel the exact same. Any tips to just get my mind off things like a cool craft but not something too hard my motivation and willingness to get outta bed always overpowers.  ",depression
Vent: character development?,Idk what I’m honestly doing writing on here but hey I’m here anyways the last couple years have sucked and I haven’t handled them the best I’ve had manic breaks and went through yet another experience to give me ptsd I’ve been through dozens of horrible relationships experimented with my sexuality realizing I am a trans queer man but my mental health still has a stronger hold on me which I think I’ve been in denial over but idk if it’s good or bad that I’ve realized everything that went on but yeah character development  I guess lol ,depression
Battling my demons,I am a 20 yer old female. I never really believed I was depressed. I was always the happy friend of the group but here lately I haven't been myself. I reached out to my boyfriend and I let him in on my past. He knew I had had a rough life growing up. I lost my sister at the age of 16 due to addiction I gained my neice as a child. So it's always been hard to find someone to accept that part of me. I pushed everything down inside of me and just put a smile on my face and called it a day but I would come home and just lay around. My boyfriend has seen it all take a toll on me. He's been noticing a chane in me that I am not as outgoing as I used to be when we first met when we were 15. He's always held me when I get down on myself. We have been having problems because I don't open up to any one about how I am feeling. He is helping me through everything and trying but I just always push people away. I haven't told my parents how I am feeling because I am afraid. He's always been by my side and he's helping me seek professional help to try and help me and he wants me to tell my parents how I am feeling but I can't bring myself to do it. He hasn't left my side even if I have been ugly or rude towards him. He's never left my sie since I was 15. I have a cat as a coping mechanism and he went and got us a dog so I could sleep at night but I am up all hours of the night just laying in bed next to him staring at our celing. I am trying to get better but I am afriad talking to someone will just make it worse. I am just wondering if it ever gets better? He wants us to move to flordia and start all over for the both of us. We have both been batteling these demons together and we are both working on building to get better together. ,depression
Struggling with Opinions,"This may not be related to Depression, but I don't know where else to put. I feel like I need to vent about this. I am struggling with the part about opinions. I will think of an example. For example, if you explain what you don't like about cats, that's an opinion, right? Okay. What about talking bad about cats, is that an opinion? If that's yes, then I don't get it. I mean if you explain what you don't like about cats, then no need to talk bad about cats. That's called an opinion. I guess I am confused because if it is okay for you to talk bad about cats since you say that is an opinion. Does this mean it's okay for people to talk bad about my deceased mother because it's their ""opinion"" too? No way. That's not an opinion. I don't allow anyone to talk bad about my mother because she is NOT here and she is NOT here to defend herself. Can you see where I am coming from now??  ",depression
Lost,"I feel so utterly lost. I've pushed everyone away and stopped answering phone calls and texts. I know people are concerned, but I can't seem to care. I'm so depressed I was put on medication about 2 weeks ago, but I don't feel any different at the moment. Maybe it takes longer to work, I don't know. I am trying to get out of the depression episode I know to other they probably don't see it, but I really am. I don't want to be like this forever, but I know that's exactly what this is just an episode and it will pass like they always do, but it's hard to see the light when your the one stuck in it. I know my anixity/depression is something I'll never be truly ""cured"" of I will have to learn how to live with this and I guess this is just one of those bumps in the road. ",depression
Anxiety or Depression,"I am curious as to how to determine how much depression, how much anxiety.... and how to go about dealing with medication?
I have been on antidepressants for years and did increase my dosage for winter months (SAD--- way too dismal and bleak after New Year with short dark days and negative let downs of post holiday joys) Plus my husband just died the end of January. Obviously I am still on it .  I did recently spend some time with another man who did seem to notice that my mood is actually pretty good and positive... but I do have moments I am not clear on what to expect and tend to spaz and get overwhelmed... Said he sees more anxiety. 
I know they usually wean you off the anti Ds.... I  am wondering if anyone knows if I could go to a very low dose... and how is anxiety dealt with?  Meds when felt needed? Or always as a precaution?I would appreciate any feedback...

Freaked out.,"So, I was journaling just now. And I am horrified, but in a moment of frustration I wrote, ""why not just accept that will inevitably kill myself some day,"" .
Like that actually came from my brain.
My immediate reaction was like--WTF. And then this angry dertermination screamed back NO. I WILL NOT GO OUT THAT WAY. I REFUSE TO GO OUT THAT WAY.
No matter how horrible it gets, I refuse to let that be my legacy.
And, the infuriating thing is, life isn't even that bad! Its actually pretty good. Like, I'm just frustrated, and depressed, and angry. But if my mind goes to this fucked up place over the pretty shit I'm experiencing, then something is seriously wrong. I need to call my psych dr...I'm going to do that 1st thing tomorrow, because this is not good.
But, now I feel horrible. Like...how could I think that? Like...what the fuck, man? What the actual fuck?  Why did I even put that on paper? Why did that even come from my brain?
What kind of horrible person would even begin to think that? I've been given this wonderful gift of life. This gift that I waited for, and longed for for such a long time. And, now, my fucked up brain throws that ridiculous, disrespectful bullshit in there? Like...no. Just no. I'm not going to accept that as an acceptable thought.  Not going to even being to entertain the idea that that is ok. 
I'm horrified and ashamed that that was even a passing thought, even if it was written in a moment of depression or frustration. Like...thar is not ok.
Just...not ok...",bipolar-disorder
Learning,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar. For years I have had anxiety and panic attacks. These I have been treated for and maintained pretty well until the last couple years. My mom passed away 3 years ago and my panic attacks got worse, I started on and off medications. Things got better , and then about 6 months ago I took a turn for the worst. I have had the worst mood swings and terrible panic attacks. Medications aren't helping and I have been super depressed. That's when they diagnosed me with bipolar. So this is all new to me and I am learning how to cope with my behaviors better. ",bipolar-disorder
Covid 19 Exposure. What am I supposed to do now?," 
So my manager texted me last night letting me know that 3 people from my dept tested positive for covid 19. I haven’t had any interaction with any of them since the 3rd, I think.  But we touch and share everything in that dept. Touch Computers, carts, totes. So it’s hard to say that if I have been exposed on that level or not. I’m concerned, but I haven’t developed any symptoms yet, so I’m hoping that I’m ok. But then again, I won’t really know until the 17th, because that will have been 2 weeks from my possible exposure and they said it takes 2 weeks to develop symptoms in some people. I probably wouldn’t be worried at all if I wasn’t immune compromised. My 2017 kidney transplant, and the antirejection medications I’m on kinda keep my immune system relatively low. So if I get it there could be very negative repercussions. Like, I don't care if I get sick. I don't even care if I have to be on a resperator. As long as I don't lose my kidney because of this, I don't care about what happens to me. Which is probably not the right attitude to have, but that is honestly how I feel. But I also feel pretty confident that I won’t, and I’m really hoping that isn’t just wishful thinking on my part. I’m going to be monitoring myself for symptoms, none the less. And taking my temperature every day. I already contacted my nephrologist to just give him a heads up about being exposed. Told him I would let him know if anything changed. But I still nervous. Especially because I’m supposed to be starting a new job on next Thursday. Am I supposed to tell them I’ve possibly been exposed? Am I supposed to stay home? I already put in my 2 week’s notice at my current job. I can’t just take it back, and if I did if I’m supposed to self-quarantine I’m just going to have to be out of work with them also. I don’t know the protocol. And I desperately don’t want to risk losing this new job. I just am not sure what I’m supposed to do at this point...",bipolar-disorder

I don't know if I can be civil right now...,"So I left wrk at 9 today. Stayed 4 hrs out of my 12 hr shift. I just...I just didn't want to stay. Its not that I couldn't, but the idea if spending 8 more hrs in that building, of being polite and acting normal  was just...unbearable. The only thought going thru my brain for those 4 hrs was ""fuck this"". So I left early. Used my unpaid time off and said ""fuck you.""
I never do that shit. Even at my previous job, where I had plenty of pto, I never called off. Even days where I wanted to. Even of days where I was injured, or sick. Even on really bad days, where we were short people, and I was so anxious about meeting dead lines I would physically shake.
And now? I just don't give a fuck. These companies don't care about me.  I'm just a replaceable cog. Doesn't matter how hard I wrk, how good I am at my job, how responsible I am. Doesn't matter that I never call off and go above and beyond. It doesn't matter. Nothing I do matters. So I'm done giving 110% for them. Fuck them.
 I know I'm manic. I've been manic for the last month. Thanks in large part to my now ex psych dr, who refused to prescribe me a med my insurance would actually cover.i spent over a fucking month and a half calling her, then calling insurance, then setting up appointments with her to discuss diff meds, then calling my insurance. 
I finally said ""fuck you"" and went to another dr. He prescribed me zyprexa, that I started taking on Monday.
But I know I'm manic, and I know I have been manic. I teeter between feeling pretty good, to really restless, to super angry. Today is an angry day.
I came home feeling restless, and angry. Feeling like there is no fucking point to life. Like...what's the point of doing anything? We live, and we die. Why does it matter what we do in between? What's the meaning to all of stupidity, and hate and suffering? Whats the meaning of all this beauty and joy and adventure? Why does any of it matter?
My kindness doesn't cancel out cruelty. And my act of kindness may matter to another person, but they are just like me--a insignificant speck of dust in this vast universe. So why do my actions matter at all? Like what's the fucking point if we are all going to die anyway? If we will all eventually be forgotten? Like, what the fuck is existence if nothing matters? 
 i've actually closed myself in my room. I need to go help my mother with dinner, but I'm so irritable and angry that I just want to sit here. I'm so angry I don't even want to eat anything. I don't want to hear anyone's voice.  I want to get fucking drunk, so that I'll stop feeling so coherent and angry. I won't get drunk of course, but by god it would be great to get plastered. Or even tipsy. Just to feel something other than this volitale sense of nihilism. Everything just feels so futile. Fuck. 
Well, I've got to be a helpful and responsible adult. Got to go pretend that everything is alright,  and bite my tongue till it bleeds to keep the snarky comments to myself. Maybe I'll wait till everyone goes to bed, get drunk and call off tomorrow. That would be a ""real responsible""  thing to do. Cause everyone knows I'm the responsible one . The one wo has a good head on her shoulders and would never do something like that. We have to maintain that perfect image, don't we? Cause god forbid I actually ACT on my feelings. Especially when it is much more convenient for everyone around me when I stuff them.",bipolar-disorder

Depression,"So after the whirlwind of emotions last night, I'm feeling pretty depressed. I called off wrk, because I ended up talking to one of my friends till 1 am, and didn't get to sleep till 2. And there was no way I was going to wrk a 12 hr day on 2 hrs of sleep.
My sister suggested I come down to CO for a while, just for a change of scenery. Which sounds like a great idea. It would be great to hang with her, and just relax without all this underlying pressure to conform to expectations. But as of now, because of all my call outs, I only have 29 hrs of UTO. And since I'm new, I have no PTO saves up. So I can't go.
Honestly, I should've gone to work today. But...I just don't care. I can't make myself care, and this is both a blessing and a curse. I cared so much at my last job that I made myself sick.
And I'm just at a point where I honestly don't care about the company or my coworkers. It helps that it isnt as much of a ""one person doesn't show up and everything falls apart"" place. It is much more independent, and there isn't nearly as much co dependence between depts. And I'm new enough that I don't have any kind of personal relationship with my coworkers, so I don't really give a fuck about them or how rough I make their day by not showing up.
I just want to stop bouncing between these extremes. I know that is the nature of bipolar, and I will prob not start to feel better for another 1-2 months, but this intensity is exhausting. 
I have been hanging out with a friend today. But it isn't just us, so I'm trying to tolerate everyone talking about whatever. Thought it would help my depression to get out. It hasn't really helped. It has been a nice distraction I suppose, but i still feel just as melancholy. I expected to just kind of chill, and maybe talk about some of the things we discussed last night. That hasn't been the case, and I'm kinda dissapointed. 
I think I prefer the intense ""fuck it all"" feeling, as opposed to being depressed. Not like I enjoy either one, but at least in the ""fuck it"" mode I'm not depressed, I'm just unreasonably angry. I've got to  go home home in a few hrs. Every time I think of going back to that house I get depressed. It's not like the house is depressing. I just...don't want to have to act like I feel fine.
I didn't get drunk last night, so that's a pretty big accomplishment. I was really close to giving in and just getting wasted. My friend just kinda talked to me, and after a while I was sleepy enough to sleep. 
Don't really know what I'm trying to say. Guess I just want to express how much feeling depressed sucks, and how dissapointed in the day I am.
I think I need to find a therapist that offers DBT. I think it would help me. I'm going to put it in my calander to look for one on monday. Well, I should probably stop being antisocial and rejoin the group. Maybe this day won't be a total bust...",bipolar-disorder
Bipolar I and comorbitiy,"I was diagnosed with bipolar I in 2002 and have been medicated ever since then. It was bad back then and I had to go inpatient for like 10 days and then do outpaitent hospitalization after that in 2003. For 17 years I never went to another hospital ever again...until COVID hit and then along with comorbity issues in combination with a discussion of early adulthood trauma overwhelmed my coping skills and sent me back to an outpatient hospitalization program again where I could actually see people in person rather than over a computer screen, which to me was insufficient for my medical needs.

Would love some input on mania,"I was diagnosed with BP about 15 years ago, but of course, it went back farther than that. I was misdiagnosed for quite a while before they landed on a correct reason for my ""craziness"". I never hit an obvious manic period until my late 20s. Before that, they thought I was just chronically depressed. 
I think the reason they missed it for so long was because I had, what is now called, ""dysphoric mania"", which is a combination of mania and depression all at the same time. In my opinion, it's kind of a waste of mania because you feel no highs or euphoria. If I'm going to be manic I want to feel the goddam exhilaration of it. All joking aside, dysphoric mania is very misunderstood and easily missed. I'm just now starting to get it.
Until recently, I would have said I had not been manic for the past ten years. Ten years ago was my last full blown manic episode. There was no mistaking it. My energy was through the roof, needed very little sleep, started three businesses, wrote and published a very controversial novel, was married at the time and had three other affairs going on simultaniously. And that was all within the space of one year. 800 mg of Lamictal a day didn't even phase it, and that's no exaggeration.
My first manic episode was in my 20s. I worked at least 12 hours a day, seven days a week, had a real estate business on the side where I was buying and refurbishing houses, mostly historic ones, was trying to rescue a crack addicted lover, and I was caring for a son with cerebral palsy. I slept about three hours a night, when I could, and no one could begin to keep up with me.
Those are two examples that were obvious mania and they went on for years. Everything in between I considered depression, but I don't believe it always was. I think I have had dysphoric mania for much of the past ten years. I have mostly isolated, been very pensive, brooding but also easily agitated, and quick to anger, especially dealing with social issues, and there are a bunch of them right now. My creativity has not been what it was when I was full blown manic. My attention span is short, and I am not as focused as before. I'm successful in my job but restless as hell. My only real joy is riding my Harley. I was raised in a religious family and have a strong faith but I struggle with consistency there too. I think I would call all of that dysphoric mania.
I feel like I am in crisis. I've kicked up my doctor's visits and counseling to every two weeks because I have this feeling of impending doom, like something is on the verge of happening. The restlessness is too intense. I am not suicidal but I fixate alot on death. When Anthony Bourdain killed himself the first thing I did was bought an autographed picture. And I have all of Hemingways books, not to read but just ""have"" because he was Bipolar and killed himself. He feels like a brother.
My question is this. If any of you have experienced dysphoric mania, what meds have worked for you? I'm about out of options, having tried so many cocktails of medicines. I know I shouldn't but some days I resort to alcohol to just be able to come out of it for a couple of hours.",bipolar-disorder
"Medications, Fear and Sadness. A great Combo...","I’m really sad today. I finally managed to talk to my psych dr on Tuesday. A lot of good that did. She was over an hr late, and so rushed I felt like I didn’t get a chance to address anything with her. And she wants me to stop two of my meds cold turkey. And I’m on an antidepressant, and I don’t think that’s a good idea. So I’m weaning myself off of that one. Or trying to. I’m not going to have some god awful side effects because she was so rushed she couldn’t give me coherent instructions. I tried to talk to her about what was going on, but she kept interrupting me. And then we got to a point where I actually did get a word in edge wise, and she asked me if I had experienced any trauma. And I’m like….well, yeah. Who the hell hasn’t? It’s not something I want to go into. But her response was, “everything leads back to trauma.” And I just don’t believe that. We are complex beings, and I refuse to be defined by what happened to me, and to simply accept that everything that is wrong or is encouraging this latest depressive episode is purely related to trauma is ridiculously narrow minded.
I actually went for a second opinion about 4 weeks ago. He is the PA that originally helped stabilize me when I first moved here. He did a really good job helping me then, so I decided to see him again. He suggested I lower the Wellbutrin, and up the lamotrigine. So I did. I tried to talk to her about that too, but once again, I felt like I couldn’t get word in. She is usually great, but this experience has me questioning her ability to treat me. Especially because I told her I was struggling so much and she just seemed to breeze over it. Once I get my new insurance I’m going to go back to him. Maybe I can get her notes and see if he has any insight on what her treatment plans were.
 But she also suggested I start taking Latuda. Which is fine, but I can’t get anyone to prior authorize it for me. I’ve been trying to get it for over a week now. And when they prescribed it a month ago, I spent two weeks trying to get it prior authorized and I still couldn’t get it. It makes me not want to even try it, because I know how difficult it is to get a prior auth. And if that is going to be the case every fucking month? No thank you. I’d rather try something that I can actually fucking get. See, this is pissing me off just talking about it. But now I’m worried because I’ve stopped the abilify at her recommendation, and am on a lowered dose of Wellbutrin and can’t get another antidepressant. I’m going to try an call her again on Monday and try to set up an appointment for later in the week maybe to see if I can address any of my concerns or if she recommends a different medication that I can actually fucking get. I just can’t let my depression get bad again. I can’t afford that. Not right now. Not with job interviews and other stressors. I can’t afford to go into the hospital again. Not that I think I am anywhere near that point, but if I don’t get some kind of help soon, I very well could be. So I’m just desperately hoping I can see her again soon, and we can work something else out. But I am scared. Scared to feel like this, and scared to be adjusting my medications with such uncertainty. I’d ask people to pray for me, but I’m not sure I believe in that anymore. Or not sure I believe it does any good. I just need help. And I am trying to ask for it. But it is just taking so terribly long and progressing in such a convoluted way that I’m afraid. On the days I work I don’t have time to think about this, or be afraid or worried. But on my days off, it’s like it eats me alive. Today is one of my days off, so it is really bothering me, and making me fearful. I just want help. Please…someone help me….  ",bipolar-disorder
Wanting to Weep,"I wish I could identify why I want to cry all the time. I feel like I am always on the verge of tears, but I can’t seem to figure out why. I’ve been depressed before, and I know I am struggling, but it has never manifested like this. I don’t cry of course, because that would be a waste of time. Especially because nothing productive has ever come out of crying. But I don’t like it. I don’t like this sensation that sits behind my eyes, this constant companion to my daily life. I’ve contemplated watching sad things just to get myself to cry, hoping that that might help. But I hate crying. So making myself cry just doesn’t feel productive, or useful. And it doesn’t help that I live with my parents, so there is no way for me to cry in privacy, unless I wait until everyone is asleep. And crying in my room while everyone is sleeping just feels pathetic. I have no reason to feel like this. And I can’t identify the problem, so I can’t fix it.
 The only other time I felt like this was when I was hospitalized for the last time. But then I actually did cry. Couldn’t stop crying. The weekend Dr ended up prescribing me a Xanax because I was so distressed about why I couldn’t stop.  It stopped me of course. Kinda stopped all forward momentum on the crying front. The week day doctor wasn’t happy that they had prescribed me Xanax. She said “maybe you needed to cry,” and she was probably right. But I just so didn’t want to feel that way that I took whatever they gave me. And maybe I need to cry now. But crying is just so absolutely useless. I don’t know. Maybe I will feel better afterwards, but I doubt it. Especially since this is a daily thing. I wake up wanting to cry, and go to bed wanting to cry. I go through my day constantly feeling on the verge of tears. Which is odd, because I don’t feel emotionally raw. I just feel…sad. Very sad. Like, things can happen, and what not, and I can control myself. I don’t burst into tears when something frustrating or bad happens. There isn’t this emotional volatility that I usually associate with feeling this way. It is just this constant desire to cry. And it is a physical sensation. Not just an emotional one. I can feel tears behind my eyes every day. Like that feeling you get right before you can’t hold it in anymore, or that feeling you get when you are trying desperately to maintain composure. But nothing has happened to make me feel this way. And this is so fricken frustrating. I don’t want to feel this way, but without being able to identify why, I don’t know how to make it stop. ",bipolar-disorder

"Stigma, Friendship and Honesty","I wish I could stop being ashamed of my bipolar disorder. I know all the rhetoric. All the “ it’s the same as any other disease,” and all the reasons I shouldn’t be ashamed.  But I am. I can’t talk about it to anyone in my life other than my mother. And I don’t want to burden her now, because she has so many other things to worry about.  But then again,  I don’t want to burden her in general. I really wanted to talk to her today, though. But I decided to journal instead.  
I was just thinking, and I have been thinking, about how no one in my life, other than my family, knows that I have it. Well, that’s not entirely true. My friends in Colorado all knew. Largely because I ended up in the hospital so many times. But I wasn’t ashamed with them. Or I at least felt like they understood. Or if they didn’t understand they never made me feel awkward about it.
Even being here for 6 years, I still haven’t made any friends that I feel like I can share that with. And the one person I made friends with actually said something well…I guess you’d call it insensitive. She said something about how people need to be medicated, or about how people who are doing this or that needed to be on medication. I don’t remember the actual comment. But it was disparaging. Not in an intense way, just in a kind of like, “oh I shouldn’t say anything to her about my bipolar” kinda way. I mean, she did kind of give me an out. She said asked me if I was “one of those people” who were on medication. I said no, because I didn’t want to make things awkward, and because I don’t want her to think less of me.  She wasn’t being malicious, and had no intent to hurt me. It just informed me about how she wasn’t someone I could share this with. We more hang out to do fun things, and just get out of the house. We talk, but it really isn’t anything of consequence.
And sure, I have other friends. But I still don’t feel comfortable talking about this stuff with him. He’s offered an ear to listen, but I guess I don’t want him to think less of me either. I know that it is possible he wouldn’t, but seems to be so put together, and so…confident about his life. Sure, he’s told me some of his money struggles and other things. And I’ve opened up to him about my relationship woes. But this heavy stuff—I can’t share this stuff. Or at least I feel like I can’t.
 I know it all boils down to the fact that I worry too much about what people think. But I like these people, and I don’t want their opinions of me to change. There is nothing saying it would, but I just have this certainty that they would view me differently. And I can’t really know that until I try it, but I’m not willing to risk the two friends I have to be that vulnerable. I mean, in the long run does it really matter if they think less of me? In the grand scheme of life, with all its ups, downs, and in-betweens it doesn’t. But at this point in my life, it matters to me. I don’t want people I like to know this about me because I feel like it would change the way they view me. And I don’t want to be viewed as weak, or unbalanced, or crazy, or your any other negative thing that is associated with bipolar disorder. I especially don’t want someone to not believe me, or belittle me. I want to be viewed as me. Not as my illness.
And there is a little voice in my head that says “real” friends wouldn’t do that. But “real” friends have done that. And I don’t even know if I consider these people that type of friend. I haven’t exactly tested the waters in that regard. But keeping this to myself all the time sucks. I feel like I'm not being genuine by hiding this all the time. But I don't know how to bring it up. Or if I even want to. But it bothers me. It bothers me that I feel like I have to hide this part of myself, when it is a very real portion of who I am. I am not my illness, but it has shaped me in different ways. Shaped me into the person I am today. So denying it--hiding it--feels...untruthful. Feel like I'm denying part of who I am. And I get tired of trying to keep up the facade. Or of trying to avoid that area of my life, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep it out of conversations. I'm starting to want to share it. I'm resisting, but it is a part of me that wants to be know. A part of me that I don't deserve to feel shame about. Perhaps thats what it boils down to. I shouldn't feel shame about this part of my life, this part of my story. But I do. And therein lies the problem. I just want to be honest. Honesty with myself. Honest about myself. And honest with other people. I wish that wasn't so difficult, or terrifying...
Thanks for reading. If nothing else, I suppose I can be honest here. So maybe thats a start.",bipolar-disorder
Hi! I'm new. So let me spill my guts.,"Howdy! So....not really sure where to start. I was diagnosed with bipolar 3 way back in high school. I've been dancing this demented waltz with it ever since. I've been having a rough go of it for a while...like....aybe 6 months? I’ve finally contacted two psychiatrists. I have appointments set up in may for both of them. I’m trying to get a second opinion. My first psych always attributes things to situational depression. Which is very real, and something I have, at times, struggled with. But my situation isn’t negative. I don’t hate my life, or anyone in it. Sure, it can be a little lonely, and work is super stressful, but there should be nothing that is causing this amount of…disquiet. Like, I’m thinking about self injury again. Like nearly every day. It will pop into my brain at least twice a day, which isn’t that bad, but it certainly isn’t good either. Especially when I haven’t felt this way in like…5 years?? I had a slip up on Sunday the 19th. And I felt absolutely awful afterwards. I felt vindictive when I did it. Like, “take that!” It doesn’t make sense that it was directed at me, but it felt so much like a “F you” that I did it. It was stupid, and afterwards I just felt…numb. This kind of depressive blanket wrapped itself around my chest, and I honestly felt like I just wanted to keep doing it to punish myself for doing it in the first place, but I was at least able to recognize that circular logic and stop myself. But the desire hasn’t waned after that first time.  Its like once that door has been opened, its difficult to shut. I know how to distract myself, and methods and techniques to use to avoid participating in the behavior, but god damn…in the moment none of those seems as satisfying, or as judicially significant as the act itself. And the day afterwards I was terrified someone would find out. At the same time I wanted to talk about it so bad I felt like I was going to burst. But I bit my tongue, and chose to stay silent until the desire to share it worked its way out of my system. But it was then, that night, that I realized, really, truly realized that this isn’t getting better and I need help. I made an appt with a therapist the next day, and have finally been able to set up some psych appts. So I’m trying. And I even thought about looking up support groups in my area before I realized that the covid 19 thing has kinda nixed that. I’m trying to find decent online ones, but it is so easy to get bogged down by all the negativity that’s out there that it can sometimes be more harmful than good. I also had a really bad experience when I tried to chat online about it once. To be fair, I was 16, and no 16 year olds know how to deal with this shit. I had someone tell me it didn’t exist, and that everyone had mood swings. I basically said, “F you” and left that chat as quickly as I could. I haven’t really ever given it a chance since then. But considering I can’t actually attend one in person, I suppose I could try this ones…so there it is. It is so much easier to post to a faceless forum than it is to talk about this in real life. At least here, I hope I won’t be judged or shamed too terribly. I get enough of that from myself. I don’t need it from other people. So here's to hoping no one is a judgmental jerk.

But lynnis still not talking to me due to a very petty reason despite my apology and I fixed the error. i dont want to ride with lynn much less be in the same room as her. I could always drive myself but I would prefer to carpool. Should I stick it out and ride with Lynn who isnt speaking to me, or do youthink its better to drive myself?

She searched for my body!,"So I'm not in communication with my family. I moved out on my 18th birthday. At 30 years old I had a family meeting to get answers. Long story short. This family is not against incest and will allow incest to continue. It is ignored. Pedophiles are protected and even invited to Thanksgiving dinner. So once in a blue moon like since my family meeting at age 30. My biological mothers words were I was molested and I don't treat my mother the way you treat me. I was molested by my father and his brother for years and contracted an STD at 3. So I'm very estranged from my biological family. My last conversation with my granny was  year and a half ago. I called her in desperation because I was in fear for my life due to domestic violence. I knew she wouldn't help. She told me to boil hot water throw it on him or move out and leave a letter. I said goodbye and let her know I was going to myrtle beach. I had no intentions of speaking to her. My EX LAUGHED SO HARD. He said ""your granny literally calls you to see if your alive"" and he's right. Before this final call with granny I called her outside of the police station because he assaulted me and bit me and like an idiot I called her. I'm so stupid like she doesn't love me. Even though she says it with her mouth. When I told her about him biting me she started laughing at me knowing I was waiting for police she laughed and said ""was he hungry"" needless to say I said bye. I year and a half later she leaves a note on my door. Saying I found you. I call her confirm I'm alive not dead. I also confronted her about laughing at me. I got cops taking pictures and you laugh. She says she was ""joking"" after counseling and domestic violence group. Her saying she is joking is verbal abuse. My ex would slap my face and say it was a mosquitoe I was joking. My ex assaulted me because I was sleeping. My granny said she felt sick in her stomach when I said I was going on a vacation almost a year and half ago. So she called the cops twice to do a wellness check! Like what the hake!!!!!!! I told her I forgive her but I refuse to talk to her about my escape from death and relive it. A year and half later she's ask me are you safe I prayed for you. Do you have furniture? I Love you? I said I will only talk to you about Jesus. You guys. I spoke to her about Jesus and gave her scriptures. But she's being fake. I'm going to call records to see if she called the police. Because if she did it helps his next victim. I told her I forgive her. She called my me again Friday trying to find out how I survive. I want to send her another text. Because she has made my heart explode. My heart is in particles. I told her I forgive her and to prepare for the 2nd coming of Jesus. But I do not want a relationship with her. I told her you would have never found my body. She said but I would of found him. I said only because my counselor asked for his address and I told you that and you said oh yeah let me get the address too. I saw her when I was 30. I'll be 35 September. For my mental well-being her lack of remorse no apology. I'm appalled she even calls me. I don't want a relationship with her. I forgive her but I want to text her to stay out my life. Your looking for a dead body. But didn't offer a floor to sleep on. But I get it. We're estranged just blood. As Christian I forgive her. But I don't want her in my life at all. Knowing she hadn't seen me in 4 years you wouldn't have found my body. It hurts like a knife when your just a body to your blood relatives.",bipolar-disorder
Having a tough time holding it together,"I’ve been struggling a while now. My moods have been all over the place and I’ve been having a fair amount of emotional outbursts and can't seem to ever focus. I've been growing more concerned because I can feel a manic phase coming. I've been slipping for a few weeks with my anorexia recovery and I don't think a manic episode will help. I've contacted my psychiatrist but it's taking some time to make an appointment.

Time is relentless,"After writing that journal last night about losing my two sons, I went to sleep. It was a fitful night and when I woke up there was such a sinking feeling in my stomach. I remembered a Blue Spruce that I planted in the front yard of my first house, many years ago. The little thing was straggly as hell, about two feet tall, struggled to make it through its first northern winter. I never thought it would survive.
A while back, I drove by the old place to reflect on my life in those early years as a young man. I hit the brakes as I drove past. That pitiful little tree had turned into a magnificent thing, over thirty feet tall and glorious... stunning! Made me realize that the passing of time is relentless. It moves forward with or without us. It gave me such mixed feelings. The seeds we plant have an affect, whether we realize it or not. I felt sad for the sour things that I had planted along my path, and I felt proud for a few things that have flourshed, like my two other sons that survived their illnesses and have become glorius creatures, planting positive seeds all along their way that will flourish. I am proud of them and celebrate their lives today.",bipolar-disorder

Trying to back away from the edge...,"I'm new here... knew it was time to reach out to my BP brothers and sisters. It can be a very lonely place for folks who travel this road. I've been on it for a lifetime, and medicated for the last 15 years. The highs can be breathtaking but the lows... damn! Many of our kind (about a third, they estimate) end up being sucked into that vast hole of nothingness, never to return. It's such a slippery slope. And so precious few understand our plight. 
I'm just emerging from a year long trek through that dark place. I can finally breath again but it also scares me. I feel that familiar exhilaration and it beats the hell out of depression, but with it comes risks... exciting possibilities but horrific potential for damage. I am doing okay right now but I certainly feel that gravitational pull toward the edge. I'm not sure how to stay safe. I frantically adjust my meds but the allure is intoxicating! 
Sometimes, I think the contrast of depression makes the excitement all that much more irresistible when it comes around. I think of the Kurt Vonnegut quote: ""I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center."" 
That is also a slippery slope, as much so as depression only on the other extreme. So how do you safeguard from going over? Lamictal has worked best for me with respect to the depressive side but most of the other meds for the manic side take all the creative jucies right out of me, leaving me just to exist. That's not an option for me.
I was watching a Neil Young documentary today and an old song resonates... ""I'd rather burn out than fade away"". but at the same time I don't want to burn out too quickly and I don't want to damage anything around me.
How can I maneuver through this?",bipolar-disorder

Lynn aske me to put our names and the date of the party on the glasses. She told me which name to put on which color. Well she picked red for the bride anad i know the bride prefers blue so I changed three names and colors. I finished them and sent a pic to Lynn and she is livid. She said she picked the colors and let everyone but me pick the color of their glass. She called me disrespectful and said she will never let me help her again. I told her not even to start about disrespectful, she did not buy enough glasses for the whole 14 person bachelorette party, which is very disrespectgul because all of these people are important to my other sister, the bride. I apologized to her and went back and put the right names on the right color glasses. Lynn is very hot tempered and now is pissed at me. I amost dont care but she needs to get off her high horse and admit she makes mistakes too. I did apologize and i fixed the cups.

Babysitting advice?,"As I've written many times before, mom and I watch my nieces and nephews every other weekend while my sister who is a nurse works 12 hour shifts. The boys are 16 and 13, and the girls are 4 and 6. The girls are whiny and bratty but I love them. The 13 year old boy plays video games all day so I rarely see him. The 16 year old is why I am writing this. He has the maturity of a 5 years old. He needs constant supervision. He gets into boxes, bags, drawers, everything he knows he isn't supposed to. Yesterday he pooped in the pool and we all had to get out for the rest of the day so dad could disinfect it. My mother and dad were furious and called his mom at work and she was pissed. Then later on he took two boxes of pop rocks that I had bought for the gurls and popped them all over the patio which we put in last summer. Then I caught him trying to take the party poppers. He knows to ask before he takes anything. I was so mad at him! I do not want him to come over anymore because he takes things that aren't his. My sister Lynn was the same way would steal money jewelry anything she wanted then deny it when we caught her. She didn't stop stealing from us until she moved out and we changed the locks on the house so she couldn't get in. What would you do? Am I justified to not want the kid over?",bipolar-disorder
"Do I feel joy, ever?","Trying to pay attention when I laugh or smile during the day because my internal dialogue says I never feel joy. The last time I remember feeling joy is when I was able to help one of my clients through a very difficult day. I was with him when he passed and he had wanted to go for such a long time. I felt joy when my dad passed because he suffered from many maladies including depression and I knew he was dismally and amazingly at peace. So for today, with my grandchildren starting their first of seven days in our care, my focus is going to be on catching myself feeling positive or joyful. Please wish me well. ❤️",bipolar-disorder

Advice for the working gal/guy,"As I begin a new job, I'm wondering what is the best advice you have or have been given relating to the workplace?
mine is this:
my first job was at a local ice cream parlor. I don't remember why but my manager called me into her office one day and told me this ""perception is reality and reality is perception"" meaning the way you see your world is your reality and another persons reality is based on how they view the world. So just because I believe one thing, not everyone else does. It hit me hard and ten years later I remember those words often. ",bipolar-disorder

Granted, I don't know all the story as the media doesn't tell everything and the guy should have kept his mouth under control regardless of anyone who may or may not have egged him on.  As I said I don't know the whole situation.  There is no excuse for this behaviour.   We are all human and have faults but geez a psychiatrist... really?

Newbie,"Hello!I am new here and could really use a friend in the same boat. Im 27 and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last September and this is the first support group I've joined. I'm still having a hard time accepting my diagnosis, as in I'm constantly trying new things and expecting a cure only to be disappointed when I remember- duh there isn't one. I don't know one other person friend or family with bipolar and every time I try to talk about it I'm met with mild support and uncomfortable faces. I know they mean well, but it's made me stop talking about it. I feel like it could help to talk to others going through what I am going through. Anyways- I'm a good listener if anyone needs an ear!

ECT: On the Table?,"So bottom line, I had 2 recent hospitalizations, expressly for the purpose of tweaking my medications. When I say I've tried everything, I kid you not, I have. Not doing well, after all that. My caregiver (I live in a group home) got me in to see my pdoc and she recommended electro-convulsive therapy. I wouldn't even be considering it but the thing is, I'm starting to get desperate. My family and friends have always told me how intelligent I am, but I don't seem to be smart enough to find a cure for schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Anyway I wrote this just to say, I had pretty much made up my mind to give it a try, but my sister says no. (I'm 57 years old and she's 76). I'm very upset since my phone call with her about this, and probably will have a hard time sleeping tonight. It's kind of funny though, when you consider how old I am and my sister is still trying to run my life, like hers is so freaking great. Pardon me, but like I said, I'm upset. Would anyone care to weigh in? Thanks. (I love being a part of your group.)",bipolar-disorder
My waist trainer,All my life Mom told me to watch what I eat cause it will catch up to me. My metabolism used to be great. Five years ago I was a double zero. Now I where a large top and bottoms and I don't even know what size jeans I wear cause I haven't worn jeans in years. People often mistake me for being pregnant because my belly is so huge. So mom got me a waist trainer to help slim my belly down. Basically it's a girdle. Sitting is so hard because my midsection doesn't bend with this thing on. It's the Zyprexa that made me gain all this weight so this post is rIgor on topic. I hate it. The only thing good about gaining all this weight is that I can know shop in the misses department as opposed to juniors or children so my clothes now are more age appropriate and mom and I can share clothes now,bipolar-disorder

Therapy Processing Take Aways,"Some thoughts to process from therapy session: 
Anxiety and negative thinking are a toxic marriage with depression and fear based living as the elephant in the room that no one sees. 
Letting go of the need for control and perfection, is radical acceptance of my Humanness. Letting go of the need to force my opinion, wants or needs to be met by another person is freedom in mind body and soul.
I can/do smile behind a mask and people can 'see/feel my smile' through my eyes....the windows to the soul. At the same time, my mouth is covered so I use my eyes and ears more effectively, rather than speak a response.
The ebb and flow of my life, moods, energy are open more when I have human contact.
Atomic Habits...(book) start at """"""1%"""""" and then build to 2%....3 months to create a habit, so my Hope and Prayer is that by the time fall arrives, I'll have enough 1/2%'s to get me through the winter months with no more deep depression symptoms, rather more tools to use and healthier behaviors in place for a better mental and physical health.

One of the biggest challenges I have created in my life is isolation, the other is numbing away on the computer...creating in my life Overwhelmed and I Don't Know Where To Start....so I got this book from the library called Atomic Habits by James Clear.

I don not get it,"Ok I live in Arizona covid is real bad right now, hospitals are overwhelming. My friends who are nurses call me non stop because I listen to their horrible stories. I had covid and still am not right I worked on the covid floor. You can not breath no oxygen or a vent or meds will make you feel you are getting enough oxygen. You literally feel like you fucking drowning. I am sorry I'm being so damn blunt but people need to understand.  So saying all this I live on this big ranch style property with my friend Chris who lives mikes down the dirt road. It is a dairy/ orchard ranch but besides the point ....so tomorrow is Father's Day and I do want to say for all the fathers out there happy Father's Day. So what is going on is a fucking BBQ now when we have a BBQ ends up with fifty or more people.  A lot of people will wonder inside because it is supposed to be close to 110 so it is to damn hot outside and no heat doesn't kill covid. What the hell is wrong with people. I have to see my mother in the beginning of July who is turning 89 so I'm staying far away and I can't stand the sight of my mother. Like I said you wouldn't want this virus on your worst enemy. I'm so angry I'm shaking.  When I say my peace they just look at me like well don't come. I say nope I'm not but guess what if any of you get sick I will not be able to handle it.  They are my family and love them to death. There will be a couple of older fathers here and I say if you love them please I don't want that type of love.  I'm sure they think I'm just upset because I lost my father five years ago and yes he was my best friend and it is a very difficult day but if he was alive I would hug and kiss him through the window because I love him. That is what you do and they all think I, the crazy one.  It is like I live in a different world than these people.  Than as I'm leaving they asked if my kids would be there I laughed and asked if they heard one fucking thing I said.  I replied no I probably will go for a long day drive because they will be screaming wanting to go to the party and no explaining to a year old twins about social distancing. 
ok sorry I'm just so so frustrated I just don't get it. I thought we loved each other but I guess I'm a fool. What a joke.maybe I am alone in this world it sure feels like it.  All right after bitching I really do wish all the fathers out there a happy Father's Day. It might me different this year but it is different because you are loved and that is a great thing. Hope everyone has a great weekend and I apologize again for being so blunt. It is just not worth taking a chance with this disease. I write it because I really do care about people on this site.  Namaste Pema",bipolar-disorder

Long time peeps...,"My last post was in 2016 and I honestly feel as if it were yesterday ! I hope everyone here has been doing well. Hope everyone is safe and healthy with COVID-19 taking us by storm. 
Ive been through a lot since I last logged in. Firstly and worst of all, my sister, my best friend, died 2 days after my 28th birthday on 12-28-17. I was unfortunate enough to be the one who found her. Drug overdose. She was staying with me at the time, she had just gotten out of rehab. Was doing the best we ever saw her. And then in 2 short weeks of her being home, we lost her for good. She was 26 years old.
That has been a struggle very much so for me. We were 18 months apart. I feel a piece of me is missing and it feels odd to walk the earth without my buddy. My soul mate. I wont even continue with what else I've went through since the last you all heard from me. Im trying to stay positive. 
Im still not medicated for my BP and not for my PTSD either which I was diagnoised with since my sister's death.
But the good news is, Im working 6 days a week at a job I LOVE! Where I'm manager :) I got a new car last Saturday, I have a healthy routine and Im just taking things day by day. Thats all I can do right?

"Hey everyone, I am new here =)","I figured I should put up an introduction after joining. First, my health care providers are not quite sure what to classify me as, but, they are leaning pretty heavily on bipolar disorder. ""Regular"" medications are not working and we are starting a line of medication directed towards bipolar, they seem to help a small amount, I am calling that a small win but a win nonetheless. I struggle with mood regulation right now, it is straining my home life. I have some ""blips"", meaning, I see or hear things; acts up when I am feeling okay or really depressed/irritated. I am trying to learn more about the disorder and see if I can get my drastic mood changes under control. Thank you for reading.",bipolar-disorder
Anxiety,"I have anxiety through the roof today. 
I slept well and long.
When I got up the first thing  my husband wanted to talk to me about was health insurance.  We are going to have an $11,000 deductible. I am not sure if that is per person or per holder and spouse.  It would not be cheaper to get the copay insurance.  It would be almost $10,000 HIGHER per year for it.  
This anxiety isn't going anywhere today. I can't get it to budge.  Two of my friends are feeling the same way. Anxiety won't budge. I know at least I am not alone.
I am very overwhelmed.  I need a shirt that says ""I'm on strike and I may bite."" LOL I'm not really on strike just life is overwhelming right now.
I do have some Ativan but that won't help. IMO it would be like drinking to make things better.  That never works out well.  So Ativan is not a good option at this point.  
What is a good option is finding something to help with distraction.  So far none of my emotional regulatilon ideas are working at all.
I know sometimes all we can do is just sit and be uncomfortable with our feelings.  This may be one of those times.
That being said suggestions for dealing with this overwhelming amount of anxiety are welcomed.  
No drinking or drugs to ""help"" deal as that won't help.  Just ways naturally to deal is the way I am looking to go.

A pleasant surprise!,"I was laying on the couch just now and got up to check on my dog who was sitting at the door people watching. I peaked out and there were too packaged outside on our front stoop. I assumed they were for my sister as she always has her packages shipped to my house. But my name was on both packages. I haven't ordered anything recently. I opened them up and one is a cute mug with a ceramic cow in the center, the other is a cedar block frame with a cow on it. My closest friends and family know I love  cows. there was no note, card, or anything else to say who they're from. Just shipped from amazon. anyway, it was a pleasant surprise. I posted on Facebook to see if the sender will come forward. My birthday was in April and I asked for cow stuff so I'm thinking it's a late birthday gift. just wanted to share something positive in this angry world. ",bipolar-disorder
Mental Health Heart Shift,"One of the things I've found out about myself is that I lack self confidence, and can make ''fear based decisions'''especially where Big decisions need to be made for Huge Life Shifts. Also, living alone my thoughts can sometimes lead me into the wrong direction and hense make a wrong decision. Sometimes for me the Hardest Decisions like with my son, myself/health push me into emotional thinking, sometimes 'stinking thinking' and because I don't have someone to bounce off my thoughts and feelings except my therapist, well I stay in my head Way Too Much!
The past week, from the 7th to making the decision, in a Fear Based Thinking mode because I saw a tick nest, to an acceptance of offer that would break me financially on the 8th...continuing in fear based mode, sleepless nights, my mind and stomach in an uproar I ended the process last night and will not sell my house, I'm just not ready in mind, body and soul. Today I feel relief after letting my agent know and he said ""it's ok"", yes I might have to pay some stuff but in the long run a drop in the bucket compared to buying, getting a new mortgage and paying closing fees.
Next plan is to make my home a 'one level' living area with a portable washer and dryer in my kitchen to avoid having to walk down stairs. Make improvements slowly so I'll know in my heart I'm not doing a rush job and sticking someone else with problems to fix and probably get a better price for my house in a year with the improvements done.
Will I need help, yes and I've got my son to help me. As far as ticks go, well I can be Really Really careful. As for John and his future, well I think in the long run I'm making a good decision by Slowing Down and really looking at All Areas in his and my best interests.
Even last night, another sleepless night, I thought if this condo that I was going to purchase, has been on the market for over a year, is too small for a roommate if John wanted one...well how would he cope down the road if he wanted to sell it...a Nightmare for him for sure.
I guess I'm writing all this because I did a Manic Decision, and in the end, Thank God, came to my senses before I really took a deep dive. The last Manic Decision I made was in 2012, and I'm still paying off the debt today and have a balance of 2500.00 remaining to be paid. I am very grateful that I was able to push past the fear of telling someone No, not trying to make nice nice for someone else at my detriment...I've never been good at confrontation, and have lived a life of codependent behavior...Not Any More! So grateful right now that I can move forward after having ""recognized"" in myself a mental health challenge, I'll always be a work in progress...looking through the eyes of knowing there is a silver lining in the clouds.
Thank you all for your good wishes...ml",bipolar-disorder

Concerned for both my son and myself,"Hello all. As usual, I'm here when I need to type and air things out to people that I know have an understanding. I am BP2 and it has been well-managed for years. Part of my struggles are that depression is triggered easily if routine changes, and if life's problems pop up. I am now feeling very upset. I am feeling hopeless because of my son. He's 13 and is exhibiting signs of mood disorder. Irrational plans to leave in the middle of the night where he doesn't seem to recognize the danger, or feels that he could avoid the danger. He almost ran away from his mother's house last week having been triggered by her from something very minor. He's had an intake with a counseling agency, but we are needing med management for sure. 
I blame myself for passing on this awful burden to him. Maybe it's just teenage hormones, but I really don't think so. the worst part from last night is that he's only upset that he got caught. He doesn't feel remorse. His statement was that he wanted to do something dangerous and exciting. 
I'm upset with his poor choice (fortunately he was caught before he began to try to go through with the plan, but he was almost out the door) but I'm even more concerned for his mental health. Selfishly, I am also concerned about my own.

Upset,"Last night a weird friend of us, a man, called to talk (chat). My husband was sleeping so I talked to the man, and after he kept me on the phone for three hours (for his need to talk) he and I mentioned his son, and I said I thought about asking the son whether he knows how to repair an electrical problem I have which is not a major problem since I am looking for someone who can do the work at an inexpensive cost.
This person has history of offending people by his words. He has paranoid schisofrania problem but was able to hold a full time job and just recently retired. He and I talked back and forth, and he said to me, ""I will not help you find anyone."" I was surprised at first as to why. We continued the subject, and the conclusion was he was telling me I am a con and user who is looking for free labor. I was very offended but tried to keep my cool, and I told him he misunderstood about what kind of person I am and that I intend to pay the repair person a reasonable price that costs less than if I were to call an elecrical repair company.
He didn't use the words con and user but that was what he meant. He has a habit of throwing insults at people, and he offended me many times before. I felt I should have known he could do that last night and should not have let him use me as a free therapist for three hours just so that he could turn around and hurt me. I know he didn't intend to hurt me and is just a very strange charactor who often offends others with his mean words (meaning he couldn't help himself). This time I got assertive and told him (politely) that he is a selfish person (charactor) who does not trouble anyone and does not want anyone to trouble him. I didn't use the word selfish but what I said to him means he is selfish, and I am not, which is the difference between him and me.
He freaked out and started yelling at me telling me, ""Don't you talk about the difference between you and me. I DON'T CARE!"" I was terrified by his tone of voice and his upsetness and told him I didn't mean to say I am better than him in our differences (meaning me being kind and generous VS him being selfish and uncaring does not mean I am better than him as a human being). He calmed down and continued talking for a long time (using me as his free therapist) until my husband woke up, and I gave him the phone. My point is no-one should say to a friend ""I refuse to help you find a repair man because you are a con and user.""
I talked to my husband and dauther about it, and they agree that this man should not have said what he said to me (very inappropiate).
We know him since 1988 but didn't see him much during the past 14 years. His wife just passed away less than a year ago. I used to hang out with her but not during the past 14 years since they both were busy with the grandchildren, and we are in poor health and need a lot of rest. We know he is very strange and can get very offensive if we give him enough time to talk. I am so upset that I am ready to message his daughter and ask her to tell him he is no longer welcome to phone us (we never initiated phone conversations with him) but my daughter told me it will look very bad if I do that to a man who just lost his wife. I am a passive aggresive person and avoid conflicts.
The three of us agree that it will be okay if my husband and I will ignore his phone call when he calls again next time. He didn't call often. What upsets me is I feel I should have known better not to have any conversations with him knowing he has that weird mean charactor. It seemed that what set him off last night was the word ""charactor."" He got in arguments with people online before, and they verbally attacked him. I just want to vent and thank everyone for reading it. Any comment is welcome. I hope you all have a good day today. ",bipolar-disorder
Letters to me,"I just had an idea. Yesterday I was coloring and I just had the thought pop into my head that I am so loved. One therapist suggested I write a letter to myself for when I am depressed. I have two letters. But now I'm wondering, what if I ask my loved ones to write love letters to me for when I am depressed? Because when I am depressed I feel alone and unloved and like I am a burden to my family. What do you all think of me asking my family to write love letters to me?",bipolar-disorder
Existing and Numbing Coming to an End,"For the last couple of years I have not lived, rather been in survival mode with no joy, happiness, purpose or meaning in my life.
I've procrastinated, felt shame and disgust for myself for what I know I am capable of doing and just don't do.
For two years now I've been hemming and hawing about selling my house as it's just too much for me to take care of.
This quote really spoke to me and hope might do the same for anyone who reads that just doesn't feel like they can make a decision.
Well today I made a Whopper Decision. Contacted a real estate person and now will have two apts to see two condos. Just hope it's not mania, but relief and happiness that is making me move my lazy butt. I've done more  today than in the last week as far as self care and needed house cleaning. Will ? maybe start back writing in what do you want group to keep me on track.
To make all this real, I even told two of my neighbors and made plans with two guys to come and gut out my back yard and scrap/paint my basement.

Prozac,"I've been on this for 10+ years, thought it was doing me good because I felt more balanced. Less depressed for sure. In the last few weeks I think this Prozac is not the solution for me. I seem to actually have more of an issue with mania, like anxious all the time. My doctor prescribed me to double the dose and take a mood stablizer, but when I doubled the dose it seems like the anxiety grew to uncontrollable proportions and the feeling of high blood pressure. The MS is said to take some time to feel the effects. 
Has anyone else felt like they were dosing too far in one direction or the other depression vs. mania? How did you dial it in if that is even possible. This condition has very likely killed my marriage, and I don't want it to kill me either. I guess I'm glad the mania doesn't trigger violence, but it does trigger all kinds of other feelings that eventually eat at me so much I fall back into depression.",bipolar-disorder

"Ummmmm, Help..... please.........","They always say to start at the beginning, but I don't know where that is. My daughter and my niece are both Bipolar 1.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I turned 20, but that was in the late nineties.  I have been on and off of antidepressants my entire adult life.  I would go off of them with every pregnancy, up until the last one, when my OB/GYN decided it would cause more harm for me to be off of them, than to the baby if I stayed on the, (not really sure what that says about my mental state, but....). That was 10 years ago and I haven't been off since.  
My father died in 2013, I saw a psychiatrist, via telemedicine, who told me I was bipolar and prescribed a medication I turned out to be highly allergic to, we are talking tactic hallucinations.  So I chalked him up to be a quack and went back to my original diagnosis.  
Now, after a day of raging thoughts, fast talking, and borderline manic behaviors, I'm starting to wonder if maybe he wasn't so far off the mark.  The thing is, I'm scared to death of the stigma.  Everyone else in my family looks at my niece and my daughter and thinks they are an absolute mess.  They think that there is something wrong with them.  I obviously don't!  I see them for the wonderful adults they have both grow up to be, but I think I am the only one who views them in this manner.
I already am a family outcast, this is only going to make me even more of a black-sheep. ""Oh, well at least now we all know where those two got it from!""

It's a free YouTube segment on COVID-19 from NOVA. Its a great segment, that gives me hope in the new scientists. Posting this so that everyone that views it can be better educated on this virus. I don't think it will go away. There are some very stubborn people in the USA. They refuse to understand how serious this virus is. They won't wear masks. They won't stay out of crowds. 
Not to be mean, but some people have to learn the hard way. I took the advice of the US governemt and other goverments to heart. I have a bottle of isoproyal (sp) alcohol in the car. I have a mask (thanks to MayB) :-) Its a great mask, that I am using now. I have two masks actually. I have one that I got from the hospital when I went to pay bill. It's paper. I put that one on, if I am going in and out of a place really fast. 
The one that MayB made for me, I put on when I am in a store for an extended amount of time. That one you have to tie on. 
It's very important that people distance themselves for a while.

Change,"I came across this video of one of my favorite teachers, Carolyn Myss, she is a mystic and a medical intuitive. There are many different videos on utube with her talks and she has written many books.
In this talk she speaks to the change in our world, a rebuilding, similar to after WW2, of hope and prayer for others and ourselves. In addition, in the next video speaks to how our thoughts can create such pain and if we can be mindful, staying in the moment, similar to Carolyn's words...to pray...and we might have something happen or a thought to answer our prayer if we are in the moment and paying attention.
Continued Prayers For All's Highest Good, especially those in the medical field who are putting themselves in danger in trying to help and heal others. Kindness, much like the man who offered  Carolyn a part of his orange when the orange was all that he had to eat. Walking in faith and prayer and how our thoughts can take us from the path, and we step into the  chaos of the world around us. Freedom when taking in that we are not our thoughts.

Tolerance & Kindness,"They say that at times of crisis it brings out the very best and the very worst in people. Alot of countries are very divided at the moment and what I've seen in various places on the internet it's worse there.
Basically people are shouting in each others faces. They may be only a minority but they make alot of noise. Personally I'm trying to keep away from places like the BBC comments sections but the temptation to look and get outraged/ anxious/ sad is strong. I guess for a lot of us there is not much else to do.
This relates a little bit to the post about conspiracy theorists but I think it's wider than that.
Most people have their opinions and unless they are inviting others for contrary opinions they are unlikely to change their views.
Maybe the answer is to concentrate on what unites us rather than divides us. To be tolerant where we can, remembering anxiety causes people to act in varying ways as they try and work through it. And to be kind.
I know I've not been tolerant most of the time, and often unkind. I'm trying to change that.

My chlorpromazine is helping my mind slow down a little bit sometimes but its not really a high enough dose that controls me fully like in the past. My mind still buzzing alot and all the rest but its a little better. 
Im still unable to get access to a nhs psychatrist so i will have try manage. I have a private psycho  therapist now i pay for. Although i can not contact her between sessions she will try see me or bring a session forward earlier if really urgent.

conspiracy theorists friends,"I am ONLY looking for suggestions on how to handle this.
I AM NOT wanting to start a discussion OR a debate on conspiracy theories so please don't go there for the sake of the group.  Such discussions are often heated and cause bad vibes and I've seen groups blow up entirely both online and in ""real"" life so to speak.  Let's not go there.

I find myself in a spot I've never been so heavily in before. 
A LOT of my friends and some family (all people I've known for over 20 years) are conspiracy theorists about the pandemic. 
They also have theories regarding religion and the pandemic which I am more able to understand than the other things which are mostly political in nature.  For example: virus, lab, Bill Gates, George Soros, Trump etc.
I can't just say ""you may be right"" as that does NOT get me off the hook and only makes them dig their heels in deeper to discuss the subject.
I do not want to completely avoid these people but gosh almighty they are driving me nuts. 
Besides avoiding them I don't know how to deal with their barrage of conspiracy theories.  I think everyone has a theory about the pandemic natural or manmade being the basic two choices.  I don't need to hear any conspiracy theories nor do I need a constant barrage of ""Trump is evil"" or ""Cuomo is evii"". Frankly I don't give a shit.
You think what you think and I think what I think and no one will change anyones mind so there is no point in discussing it.
Maybe I should just say that to everyone who has a theory and feel like telling me what their theory is.

I recently had a stream of job interviews but none of them seem to be working out. I had a video conferencing interview that I was hopeful about but toward the last five minutes or so my dog started barking and I had a hard time hearing the interviewer. He already had an accent and then the barking made it even more difficult to understand him. He probably had difficult hearing me as well. The last portion of the interview involved a writing assignment through e-mail. I returned that but am feeling sad about the whole situation.

I force myself to eat because I know I need to but I have no appetite. I try everyday to sleep and I wake up from nightmares and the PTSD from bullying, neglect, and sexual abuse weighs on my tiny fragile soul more than anyone knows.

No one seems to understand what it feels like to feel so bad you can't even speak. To feel so broken that you chest aches at the thought of trauma.

I noticed something...,"This is something I noticed awhile back and thought of it, again, last night.  In my experience it seems to be easier to make an enemy than a friend.  I will explain why I think this.
In my experience, friendships can be hard to maintain.  This includes romantic relationships.  They are extremely fragile.  A friendship can end over the slightest thing.  Then the former friend is an enemy.
Then there are those times you meet someone and you have a great conversation so you think you're going to be friends.  This doesn't happen because you never see or hear from them again.  You don't become enemies, you're just an isolated acquaintance.
An enemy, however, is easy to make.  All you have to do is start trouble with someone.  I don't suggest doing this.  Enemies can be made intentionally or unintentionally.  The animosity towards your enemy can last a lifetime.  Friendships rarely last that long.  If it didn't end due a falling out,  they tend to fade away.
It's also rare for enemies to resolve their differences and become friends.  I tried this once and the person stabbed me in the back so they are an enemy for life.
You can be nice someone because you want to be friends but they reject you.  That is very hurtful.  This is one example of why it's so hard to make friends.
Maybe there is so much bullying in the world.  The bully at some point discovers how hard it is make friends but they want some kind of human connection.  They then turn to making enemies because it's much easier.  It's a terrible thing to do, though.
What do you think?",bipolar-disorder

Jobs not for bpr's,"I still don't understand why voc rehab keeps putting me into crap jobs.  I know I've been out of the game for a long time but what I've learned in college hasn't been forgotten.  
I'm working at a fast food place and it's a tough day.  I end up having a small meltdown.  I apologized for my behavior so I still have a job for now.  I know I will get fired sooner or later.  Dealing with the public really gets on my nerves.  I get treated like I'm stupid.

Annoying day rant,This is a bit of a rant just to get it off my chest.  It has been a very annoying day. I got up late.  I try to limit the news I do want to keep abreast of what our governor and president say.  They are always late to their press conferences GRRR and I was annoyed about that and dinner got started very late. I did record some of it but dinner was another fiasco.  I could not find the graham crackers or the vanilla (made a cheese cake). I can't eat much of it (dairy allergy) but others can.  Then I made a shepherd's pie and found the ingredients for that today.  I started to make it yesterday only to realize that we didn't get those in our grocery delivery order. By this time I am in a mood most foul. On top of that my bank may be charging me twice for something and I had to have a conversation with a friend who has radically different political views than I do and suffice to say it was not fun.  We are still friends though not tossing over 40 years of friendship for political crap. Alexa has stopped working on my tv and hubby had to try fix it. No such luck. I asked him to help with the cheese cake and he is so freaking slow. I just wanted to put my fist through a friggin wall. I have a headache on top of that. I have cabin fever pretty bad and can't even go outside because of the pollen and crap being so high. My phone is f'ed uip too. I am going to scream bloody murder and hit something not an animal or a human but something.  I better be careful though because with my luck I'd break my hand and I am no way in hell going to a hospital. If I could just go out and even sit on the patio it would be nice but I get sinus infections from the crap outside. Oh and when I go into the kitchen and the oven is on it is too hot for me and I get nauseated and feel like I will throw up.  Summer is going to be fun NOT!!!,bipolar-disorder

I was unkind,"Yesterday I posted in bp about the group What Do You Want and I made the request to not speak about the concerns of the day, illness and talking about feelings. That there are many other places which they can be vented. The unkindness came in the form of delete post. This I now realize is a form of control after reading in one of my daily books about change, it's called The Courage To Change. 
I've closed myself up into a protective hard turtle shell, pulling in my head and only coming out, well, rarely. Enclosed in my house, I have my cat who is not  a threat, just a comfort...and very silly at times. I do feel for those who are stuck in their homes, the challenges that are dealt with every day to keep some type of balance, with family and the challenges of bp.
My selfish request of no comments of feeling or the world issue of illness was wrong because I do want people to come to the group. I've been in a hole of lethargic depression lacking of caring and loss of hope anything good will come into my life. Recently due to illness my therapist and the agency closed down. I've been Blessed they do telephone therapy. The new therapist I'm working with noted I have the knowledge of what needs to be done, I've lost the mojo, sabatage myself by negative self talk. Living alone is not easy, especially when no one is around to see the mess I created around me over the last several months.
Finally with this new therapist I've gotten to the place of I can't stand my life, the mess of my home. I am the only one who can make the decision to change....when the pain of where you are is greater than the fear of where you are going that is when you will change....well I got to my bottom, once again after falling I'm trying by crawling to do the simple self care behaviors each day that many just do out of habit.
I am having a sort of crisis because I have both physical and mental challenges...neither have been 'doing the best I can' in self care. So I invite you to drop by, to post anything, where ever you are at in your life or mental health~~I hope we can support one another on the journey with many roads that twist and turn and find our way to a more positive way to live our lives.
I do hope you will give me a second chance.

Depressive episode strikes again!,"This time, the episode has lasted up to three weeks with no seeming end in sight although it always feels like that when I'm in a depressive episode. I feel completely drained. I've been barely eating and have stopped taking my medication for a couple days when I could not bring myself to get out of bed but now I am back on my medication and this is one of my better days. I feel so unmotivated and hopeless to do anything or practice self care when I feel so worthless. I want to stay strong and positive but I am finding it very difficult. I don't want to keep feeling this way, I don't want to have to keep wondering when my next episode is going to be. I feel so distressed for no real reason and I don't know how to talk about it or explain what I'm feeling or why I'm feeling it which is just plain frustarting. Could really use some encouragement or advice on how to deal with these intense lows. I have so much work to do but no energy or motivation to do it. I'm just tired and I don't know if I'm strong enough to keep going or even succeed that way that I want to in life. I feel bad for venting on here but I figure this is what the platform is for and I like the idea of support from people who go through it as well. I don't want to be a bother to anyone on here and I feel like I keep saying the same things over and over again so I'm sorry. Thank you to whoever took the time to read this.

Bipolar Disorder and pregnancy,"Hi everyone, 
I appreciate what everyone shared in response to my other posts. Since I posted last, I was inpatient for a week and I am now on medical leave from my job until my contract ends in the summer. I had completely ruled out becoming a parent a long time ago based on the advice of a pdoc, but I am wanting to hear from you women that have gone through pregnancies-were you able to cope without meds? How bad/good was it?
Also, I am just so tired of all of the side effects of my medication that sometimes I want to go off of all of it even if I don't become pregnant. However, everything I have heard suggests that that would be disastrous. I was doing so much better a few weeks after I got out of the hospital and now I am getting depressed again because I can't go anywhere or do anything. Any hope given would be greatly appreciated. ",bipolar-disorder

Bipolar and high blood pressure,"so apart from my bipolar meds I take blood pressure meds.
Right now my blood pressure is higher than it should be and I decided to look to see if there is a link between bipolar and high blood pressure.
As far as I can see there are at least three links!
1. People with bipolar are more likely to have high blood pressure..
2. On top of that some bipolar meds cause high blood pressure (e.g seroquel)
3. Some blood pressure meds can affect mood in people with bipolar

apart from 2. I didn't know any of this.

Right now I can't concentrate properly on the various medical journals and webpages ..anyone else know about this?

is bipolar overall linked with high blood pressure? does it increase in mania?

anyone know if the blood pressure meds shift you to manai or depression or just make it all generally worse?

I'm planning on talking to a GP if the blood pressure doesn't come down over the weekend..I expect they will tell me to increase the dosage of my losarten but I wouldn't expect them to know about all the linkages between bipolar and hypertension..

Topamax mania?,"Hi, I know topamax can be used as a mood stabilizer, for epilepsy and migraines. 
I have just been prescribed 25mg once at night for last 2 weeks for migraines.
Now though although I am not officially diagnosed with bipolar ( yet) I feel I could have it. I have deffinatley years ago had very high mania and the very low cycles. I have mood changes issues due to ptsd issues and aspergers but I also feel I could deffinatly be bipolar due to the mania I had even though it was 10 years ago now. I also have tried commit suicide in my lows. 
Anyway I've started this topamax and I'm starting to feel a really fast upwardness. But I'm almost a bit too much. Like I've noticed a few times I've been a bit to lively I've become inappropriate with things I've said or my actions. Which isnt me at all.  
Isnt it meant to control ur mood not change it? I mean I feel great. I was feeling low but now I'm good apart from physical illnesses stressing me. I'm actually really anxious but I'm good. I dont know. 
Also I keep going to sleep and waking up very confused. Unsure what's happened, like even unsure if I've been asleep or awake, or where I am or what's going on. I also wake up feeling very ill and very tired. Like a million times worse then when I went to sleep. It's horrible. 
Any ideas or advice?  I mean I'm going to have increase my dose because it's not working for me in terms of controlling migraines much. ",bipolar-disorder

So I get to my clients house and get an email to call the office so I did. Apparently the scheduling coordinator abruptly resigned. I would've texted her I was gonna be late but she is no longer available. So I called the office and talked to the president who kindly informed me that the old coordinator never should have been doing work business from her personal cell phone and my tardiness would not be tolerated.

Need your thoughts,"As lots of you know I am recovering from the virus I am waiting for the last test to clear me so I can get out of this personal hell. Ok I have been thinking since time practically stands still. I finished all my school work for the semester for vet school.  Clinicals are on hold but that won't be a problem since I work on a huge ranch. Ok back to my dilemma I was a floor nurse at the hospital but I was in really really bad shape mentally and practically was wheeled in the psych ward while I was working. Yes I needed to be in the hospital but the way it was handled was very very bad and to be honest it was traumatic. I was the talk of the hospital and not in a good way. When I think about that time I begin to go down a deep hole. Now about five days ago the hospital called asking if I would help them out with the patients with the virus.  At first I wanted to laugh in their damn facess but after awhile i realized it is the patients that matter not all the bull shit. So my question is should I help....as far as going in the deep hole I don't know if that will be a problem because you are so busy not enough time to think. Than it is the safety factor I did hear once you get sick you can't get it again but I don't know they are finding new things about virus every hour. I have signed up so they can take my plasma and give it to someone that is in bad shape. Again have to be cleared for that to happen. I know I was so much happier being a nurse than anything I have ever done in my life. I love being a nurse I don't even know if I will love being a vet only because I haven't done all my clinical yet so without being out in the field I really can't say. In the back of my mind I am nervous about the stress and what I does to my mind. I tend to just push and push through long shifts but when it is time to relax my mind well let just say it scares me. I can't go back to my old self that is my worst nightmare. Than there are my kids. Shit as you can read my head is like a damn ping pong ball. Please I would really like honest feedback back if you don't mind.

Questions About CBD oil.,"With Bipolar 2, I also have a lot of anxiety.  I'm taking meds. but it doesn't seem to do as much as it used to.  My Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner suggested 3 different meds.  We could switch and gave me a list of them and said to research them and pick the one I would like to try.  I don't remember what 2 of them were but one was Latuda.  I remember people complaining about that one on here.  All 3 of these meds were very expensive.  It doesn't look like those will be an option.  I'm not sure if they work on anxiety.  It was mostly for depression which seems to go hand and hand with anxiety.
I need something because this depression and anxiety is to painful and I'm really tired of dealing with it for so many years.  I keep hearing about reading about how.  CBD treats anxiety.  I live in Oregon so there are cannabis shops near where I live.
Should I consult a Dr. before I try CBD oil or can I try this on my own?  Are the many types of CBD oil?  How much do shop employees know about the products ?

Why did I buy a car?  Be like and idiot I wrecked Chevy during a hail storm.  The roads were clear when I left home.
I was really dreading buying a car for this reason.  I was afraid of getting a lemon.  I'll probably ask for my money back since it's less than 30 days.  Then I'll go elsewhere and probably get stuck with another lemon.  I got lucky with the Chevy.
I've really had a lot of suicide idealization lately.  Today I was ready to go dive of the bridge into the icy waters of the Clackamette river.  I feel so cursed.  Bad things keep happening to me.  I feel so incompetent that I can't pick out a decent car.  Of course, My work put me on furlough so less money.  I can't see my boyfriend or anyone else because of the virus.  I'm such a coward for not going down and diving into the river or hanging myself.  I've hated living for several decades now.  You'd think I be feed up enough to push me over the edge by now.  I think one of these days something will.",bipolar-disorder

First the butter I used, she wanted me to use the other butter but said the one i chose was ok. So why say anything if it doesnt matter?! Then i put too much milk in the eggs. I know how to make eggs, mom. Then I used a knife to spread the butter onto the pan, not touching the knife to the pan at all. She freaked out on me because it is a new pan and she didnt want me to scratch it. I'm not stupid, I know how to not scratch a pan. So I told her she could just do it herself and I walked out of the kitchen. I am a very even tempered person, but I cannot take constant criticisms that my mom throws at me. 
I am not able to move out financially and I like the company of my parents.
Any suggestions on confronting her about her constant criticisms?",bipolar-disorder

Its been awhile....,"I have been doing really well for a while now and I have been able to control my ups and downs. I have a whole new added stress that I am sure that most of you now have. Schooling my daughter. I am losing my mind for the last couple of weeks with this. The school that she goes to does not have thier shit together by any means of the word. She is in second grade they do not do have meetings like Zoom or anything unless it is thrown in last minute. I have reached out on multiple different occasions to the teacher and I swear she does not like me. So the answers that she gives me are not much for me to work with. Two weeks ago when this all began I asked what I thought was some pretty simple questions: Like what order do the classes go in and for about how long. She knows that she has ADHD and I told her that routine is key. The response I got back was there are lots of schedules online that can help you yo create a schedule which works for you at home. Which is great but not helpful. I asked twice as I struggled to create a schedule that might work. The next week she started to post schedules onto the forum that she is using for the class. She posts day and night on this damn thing. I am way past frustrated with this teacher and about to lose my shit on her and the principle. I understand that things are changing and this is new to everyone. Guidance would be greatly appreciated from this damn woman. She sent home all sorts of paperwork with little to no direction. I asked for deadlines and she told me that students work at different paces so she has not put deadlines on anything. On Friday I recieved a bag of all of her books with no directions nor have any been emailed out. With the math portion in the intial packet I recieved what seemed to be 6 months worth of math to figure out for myself that we have not been doing enough math. I am being used as a multi teacher. I am expected to do math, reading, wellness, writing, library, P.E., art, spanish, computers, keyboarding (cause apparently they are two different classes now), music, science, and social studies. All in a weeks time. Everything that came home had no instructions or almost no instructions. They keep throwing things at me left in right and at the last minute. I am not a teacher. I had to step back from my job to be able to take this all on. Nevermind the endless emails that I recieve everyday because they need to send pointless notifications. All this teacher has done so far is post youtube videos on this stupid class dojo. I went from being excited to be able to help my daughter to learn, to depressed and losing my mind and contemplating giving up on life. Work was my get away and be distracted by something else. I have now picked up being a maid for everyone in my house, chef for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Teacher who has no clue. Second grade has changed so much in 23 years. OH and by the way there is almost nothing online to help that you do not have to pay for.                    Anyone having the same struggles, or feeling the same way though this, or any advice. ",bipolar-disorder

I am awake, I dont want to sleep, I don't think I can sleep. But I have chills and some minor muscle cramps like my body is tired. I read about bipolar fatigue and remember fatigue is physical and it says it happens with depression, but I can't sleep and Im not depressed right now. I just don't understand if people who are manic/hypomanic can still physically feel drained?

Over this month!,"It has been such a rough month. I've gone through ST and SH then I've been extremely sick for going on 3 weeks with an upper respiratory infection and bronchitis. My OCD is acting up, I've been rubbing my feet together until they are raw and repeatedly checking my email for something that may come and I got locked out of my Facebook because I had two step authentication on it and I was only logged into my mobile app on my phone that broke and the authenticator app I had isn't linked anymore so I kept trying things over and over again expecting different results. I have no motivation to finish school this semester but I'm still making myself I just want to quit. Yet my psychiatrist says I'm doing a little better than I was a few months ago. What? How? I don't feel that way. Granted a few months ago I was dealing with depression and couldn't sleep and was having racing thoughts but I feel like things have gotten worse.

Manipulation/control,Ive been symptom free and on medication for a year without relapse. I live with a family member. We currently got into an argument. They blamed my mental illness. And said I let them see my doctor or I have to move out ASAP. I have suppressed my values/beliefs/opinions for the 3 years I have been here because my family member is very opinionated and I figured arguing wasn't worth it. The one time I say something based off of facts/ that touches my heart. We get into an argument. Then they blame my mental illness for having an opinion/standing up for what I believe in. Which has now triggered my mental illness. I have been researching for a couple of days how to handle this but it is really stressing me out. I have been ignoring them as much as possible and I want to move out ASAP. Which I am but it takes a little thought and preparation. I've talked to my therapist but only over the phone because of the virus. I can't see my doctor until may. Most of what I found on google dealing with manipulation always assumes the person with bipolar is the one being manipulative making me second guess myself even more. I know there's no point in letting them know how much this has effected me bc they will know they have that advantage and potentially use it against me. Has anyone dealt with anything like this??? What would you suggest I do? ,bipolar-disorder

Thankyou and update,First I want to say thankyou from the bottom of my heart. Seriously it means the world to me especially being quarantined like I am. I am very very lonely and depressed it is probably a good thing I don't have any sharp objects around here. To be honest being suicidal is not a good thing anytime but right now it's awful.  Well as far as my physical symptoms I am about the same my lungs sound like I smoked a cartoon of cigarettes even though I don't smoke. My body aches severely still and my fever is still runs 101-103. I will tell ya it is the worst flu I have ever had. I was talking to my Dr on the phone and he said I should feel better on Monday and told me to hang on and keep the faith. The whole situation just sucks. I miss my babies and everything that is near and dear to me. I'm having lots of dreams about my best friend that died Heidi not sure if it is my high fever but it seems so real. I could go on and on. Oh as for the planquinal the malaria drug that is supposed to help I am very familiar with the drug because it is a Med that is used for lupus. My friend called crying because she can't get her med refilled because it is on back order. Just another thing that just gets me so sad. I know I just have never wanted to die so bad before. I statutes to write letters to my friends but than I remembered how hard my friend Heidi fought to stay alive and I'm just ashamed of it all. I know how can I want to die when I have year old twins...my thinking and very easy to rationalize is they would be better off with someone else and being so young I don't think they would remember me. I shouldn't be writing this but it just goes on in my head. I just pray that the world will get better and it makes my so sad that the world is the way it is. Scary and so sad ..well just writing this much tired me out..thanks again from the bottom of my heart Namaste Pema ,bipolar-disorder

MENTAL Surge protector overload,"Colorful language used if that bothers you don't read.

I don't know about you but my mental health surge protector almost overloaded today. I had to vent to a friend via text that someone was going to pay if they didn't leave me the fuck alone.  Jan can we have the cuss box back?! LOL
They got the pont when I told them point blank they were getting on my fucking nerves and why.  Now they are both asleep and I have watched 3 movies skipped the boring parts as my attention span is that of a goldfish currently.
I want a haircut and a Jersey Mike's sub. On the upside I have food, water and rent will be paid which is a helluva lot more than some have now.  Both hubby and son's jobs are considered essential personnel but son is on vacation this week.  
I have been isolating for weeks now due to being sick before COVID 19 hit so this is really testing my limits in ways no one had forseen. I wanted to go to California to celebrate my birthday but now I am glad I didn't go. Hubby would have gladly driven me to the airport. 
I also got a stomach bug and could not keep anything down for a while which led to not being able to take meds for 3 days.  I got hypomanic as hell. I'm still somewhat there but it is getting less now that I am able to take meds again.
I have a lot of pent up energy which can not all be attributed to hypomania. I however, do feel very aggressive and that is not good.  Pollen is so high and it was 84 freaking degrees one day this week HOT. I hate the heat to the point the air conditioning is on most of the time. 
The sinus headaches are so bad SunCloud I know you can feel me on that one. UGH.
I was listeneing to Kevin Hines some on  YouTube a few days ago and I tend to agree with him.  This is physical distancing not social distancing because we can still communicate so many ways socially and not have to be around each other. Feel free to disagree but don't argue the matter please. I'm pissy mooded and not up for that. 
Going to go take a hot shower now and decide what to fix for dinner. I HATE COOKING.

Coronavirus Myths vs. Facts per CDC/WHO,"Just some information to clear up some of the silly things I've heard as of late...
Co-Vid 19 Myth vs. Fact per the CDC/WHO
Myth: Taking a hot bath will prevent me from getting the novel coronavirus 
False. While a hot bath may be a way to relax and ease stress related to the pandemic, it will not protect you from contracting the novel virus itself.
“Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C (97.7 °F to 98.6 °F) regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. “The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.”
Myth: I can get the coronavirus if a mosquito bites me 
Untrue. As the WHO states, “to date, there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.”   “The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.”
False.  From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
Myth: Using a hand dryer will kill the virus 
Yet another falsity, as is a similar myth that claims hair dryers can do the same. Washing your hands with warm water and soap will help protect you against the virus, as will using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.  Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly.
Myth: Spraying alcohol and/or chlorine on my body will protect me from the virus 
False. Spraying these products on your body will not protect you from the virus.
“Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth),” warns the WHO. “Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.”
Myth: Rinsing my nose with saline will protect me against the virus 
Though rinsing your nose with saline may help recovery from a common cold, doing so will not protect you against the novel virus.
“There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus,” states the WHO. 
Myth: Eating garlic will help protect me against the coronavirus 
Garlic is indeed a healthy food, as it contains antioxidants and can improve cholesterol levels, among other benefits. But unfortunately, consuming this food will not protect you from being infected with the virus.  “There is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus,” says the WHO.
Myth: Essential oils will protect me from getting COVID-19 
There is no evidence of this. In fact, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently sent a letter to an essential oil company urging them to stop saying their products protect against COVID-19.
Myth:  Does taking Ibuprofen worsen COVID-19 Symptoms
Ibuprofen does not increase symptoms of the coronavirus.  ""It's just not true. It is OK to take Tylenol, it is OK to take ibuprofen. There is no association with severity in symptoms or outcome to the virus.
Myth:  If you cannot hold your breath for 10 seconds, let it out and not cough, you have the Coronavirus
Once again that is a completely made up myth and not a barometer of medical testing or triage.  There is no evidence from the WHO or CDE that is used at a triage criteria.
Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.  And they do not kill the Coronavirus.  
Are Antibiotics effective in preventing and treating Co-Vid 19.
No, Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. 
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners.",bipolar-disorder

I think of so many people who are suffering because of Fear of what ""probably won't happen"" to them. In times past when there have been media bomb blasts of bad news for mental health a method to help reduce anxiety is to turn off the tv and the radio...and yes now the internet media.
My thought goes to the horrors of war, genecide, poverty, dirty water, hunger all over the world. There are many provisions being made for unemployment and help for All to get tested and medical treatment. The best thing you can do is to just wash your hands and keep them away from your eyes and mouth, and """"my perspective"""", to pray for Highest Good of all concerned.

Without the responsibility of my dogs, I don't know what I would do all day. Lay around probably. But they need care and I am grateful to have them. They keep me active which is so important for me both physically and emotionally. I need them maybe more than they need me. I just wanted to share that pets are extremely therapeutic for me even when they are a handful. I'd rather have all four of them than just one or two. They keep me going and keep me busy during the day until I go back to work tomorrow when mom will care for them while I am gone. I go three laps around the block in nice weather so they can get out and exercise. ",bipolar-disorder

Taking Medical Leave for the rest of the semester,"I'm taking a medical withdrawal for the rest of the semester. As a lot of you know I have been struggling with school. I thought the best thing for my mental health and my GPA was to medically withdrawal. I might get some of my money back (which would be nice). I will have to repeat all my classes in the fall (which will suck) but I just have to do what I have to do. 
Also, I feel that I will not be able to continue with online classes. My college is transferring all classes to online learning, due to the corona virus, and I have NEVER done well in an online setting. 
I will probably regret making this decision but I see no other alternatives. I could take summer courses but its about $1000 a credit. Which would make my math class a $4000 endeavor.     
I just don’t know how I’m going to tell my parents.

I’m getting round,Yesterday I looked at myself in the mirror. I am getting round.  I asked mom if she agreed and she noticed it a while ago she said. I don't know what to do. Probably eat netter and exercise. I want to eat all the time. I am trying to snack healthy. I should walk more and snack less. I hate that I am gaining weight. At least ten pounds I. The last couple of months. I know it's the zyprexa and the depression making me want to eat more. I am now in a size large clothes when I was a medium in the fall. I went shopping and went to the mediums but they are too tight. I haven't minded much as long as I have clothes that fit. But I am getting round which is depressing. In my early 20's I was a size 0.

Credit,So I have something really odd to talk about so I went to my bank they said that I was able 2 get a credit card from them but I am not really sure if a credit card would be such a good idea because of my diagnosis being bipolar would cause me to go on a spending binge if I got sick with Mania so I'm just seeing who out there thinks that maybe not getting a credit card if need be even though it might help with building credit would be a waste of time is it benefiting me but I'm happy to say that I have not had an episode for almost eight years any thoughts to this I think I'm doing the responsible thing,bipolar-disorder

Lamotrigine/ Lamictal?,"Hey everyone, 
I just started Lamotrigine, the generic of Lamictal. Has anyone been on this medication? I'm not sure how I feel when I'm on it. I started two weeks ago taking it twice a day and now its been upped to three times a day. This is the forth medication I am taking right now. I don't feel as low as I was, but I didn't skyrocket into mania which is nice. I have noticed an uptick in ST and random feelings of panic but I'm not sure if thats just because of school. I do feel better but I also gave up alcohol which can improve mood.

Just a BMW,"When I was training to be a life coach one of the tutors introduced me to the idea of giving clients a BMW. As in ""bitch, moan and whine"", allowing people to get stuff out of their systems before getting on with the more constructive part of the session.
Here's mine.
Winter here is turning to spring. Forget Corona Virus, politicians etc, in the real world nature is getting into gear for the year's big event. The birds to us sound like a joyous tapestry of sound, in fact it's a bunch of feathered louts shouting ""pick me, pick me!!"" and ""hey buddy, this is my patch move along!"". Occasionally this is interrupted by a low ""helllllooooooo ladies"" belch from a lone frog in the pond.
My own response to the light change is to start to go into a state of jittery confusion, running around in circles and yelping like a small dog watching Top Gear and isn't sure what the appropriate response should be.
I've got so many musical ideas, I write them down at night and when I get up I look at them in the morning I think, ""yeah, no"". I'm taking seroquel at night in a hope to air brake my way to normality but it just keeps coming back. My psychiatrist says keep doing what I'm doing but it eats up weeks of my life every year. 
Well that's my BMW.

Stopping back for perspective,"So about a year ago I meet a friends coworker who went with us on a cruise. We hit it off and started flying back and forth dating. Started to get expensive so I decided to take the leap of moving out there. I could have got my own place but she said it was no problem.
So things are going pretty good except for stress. I feel I'm understandably a little stressed about having left friends and family to move half way across the country. It started out as ""our"" house and quickly became ""her"" house. She owned it but I'm trying to get out the idea that things started having to be done her way and on her timetable. She would nitpick lots of stuff. One time I forgot about a salad I think and it went bad and I got this huge lecture about being wasteful which I was sorry for and was more than willing to pay for it if I already hadn't. 
So after a while I would start to get angry about all of this. Things rarely bother me until someone constantly makes things an issue. Did I mention I now work a 14 hr shift and commute 3.5 hrs round trip. And it's a physically intensive job. I got berated for not keeping up with dishes even though she worked from home most of the time for maybe 8 hrs. I would get intensely angry sometimes and walk off to cool off. That would piss her off because I needed to tell her what I was doing etc even though I was seeing red.
Anyways she recently broke up with me after around nine months of living together. I uprooted my life. Left my friends and family. Transferred job. Was gone 17-18 hrs a day for that job. All for her. I'm not saying I couldn't be an asshole when she would get upset with me about all the little stuff I didn't think mattered in the grand scheme of life. Was I in the wrong? Any suggestions on what I should have done? Could have done? Shouldn't have done? Etc",bipolar-disorder

Why can I be such an asshole sometimes,"You know how everyone can get grouchy when they don't get much sleep?  Well mount that 10 times.  I work nights and on 2/14 I had my appointment with my therapist at 1pm.  I work 12 hour shifts and left work at 730a and was asleep by 745a.  I had to get up at noon so I could get ready for my appointment.  I have tried going back to sleep once I'm awake but it never works.  I only toss and turn and barely get winks.  When I arrived to work that night I new this shift would not go well.  Needless to say, I was a zombie for 10 of the 12 hours.  The staff could tell that I was having an attitude but I wasn't able to make it any better no matter how much coffee I had.  Recently I read that on the manic side of bipolar, besides the euphoric feelings, anger and high agitation are very likely.  I think I was having a lot of anger and agitation mixed with sleep deprivation.  I do not want to continue to do this but I need to go to therapy as well.  What sucks is that those appointments cannot be scheduled any later than 2p.  If I do get 5 hours, I'll be ok but less than 4 and working 12 hours, I'm toast.  I am on medication but I need advice on how to keep from getting really ass-holic. ",bipolar-disorder

Trigger warning- not fair...suicide thoughts,"I'm very overwhelmed lately and feel like my family doesn't understand the choices I make for my husband when he's sick; he has MS.

My dad said I was being inconsiderate to everyone else. Then, my brother said it was sad I choose to stay home with my husband when he's sick and it's not mentally good for me. I'm warn out, I'm tired, I'm lacking the energy to do things. I've had to do it all lately because my husband has been ill for a few months; taking my son to speech therapy, doing the chores, school, work. Yet no one understands, they just judge. I'm dwelling on it but I know it's not good. Then this morning I had to talk to my husband again about hiss spending, he has bipolar as well and I'm just so stressed, my anxiety has been high, I'm having doubt in my abilities and I just want to escape life's stresses. 
I started having suicidal thoughts this morning of over dosing on a pill I know would kill me or do damage cuz the last time I had a suicide attempt in 2018 my Dr said well at least you didn't overdose on this...

Some kisses inspired clarity.,"Hi friends. I am always really worried about what I say to people who I know have suicidal thoughts because I am scared of somehow being the thing that pushes them over the edge, y'know? Tell me if you think I am right, wrong or out of line please. Just your friendly neighbourhood beeper geek here anyway :-D
Kisses, your post the other day got me thinking. According to this little black duck if “the anxiety is so high you can't even think straight” that is a different faster brain and body circuit (treatment of this is called “bottom up”) than our “language brain area” that is asking the questions (treatment from here is talk therapy even if you do it to ourselves and called “top down”).
Top down cannot contain bottom up when the body perceives that things are in danger of not being “safe and social” as opposed to fight, flight, fear or fawn. This is because we are wired for survival... we pay attention to our fast danger sense first, even when it is firing wrongly. What we can do top down is learn coping mechanisms but no matter how many I tried over the years they didn't work for me like they had for others or they only worked for a little while. Why? We are not wired to control bottom up reactions to things using top down methods. The top down brain isn't engaged till well after your anxiety has blended with and flooded you. Just in case that coiled rope is really a snake!
My opinion is you could do worse than get in touch and then stick with a mindful breathing professional. Your pick. Yoga person or one through a doctors referral probably. Somatic therapist might be an idea. Also you could learn a lot from a better understanding of the trauma informed approach and the polyvagal ladder.

Pdocs hit you with meds. That's the third type of treatment available.
The best approach is almost certainly the balanced and harmonious application of all three treatments. Make sure to take meds. Then when anxiety, worry, fear or panic hits bottom up by regulating your physiology and attention to change your perspective. Once stabilised and I can work top-down I personally dialogue inside and usually park my inner children and anxious parts and their issues in an imaginary sanctuary watched over by my inner champions until I talk to a tdoc. Then together we relate to and heal the inner wounds that cause anxiety. In most cases with desperate thinkers I think it should only be done with a professional to minimise the chance of re-injury. When we pick at our own scabs we usually don't heal effectively.
Firing questions at, wanting to get rid of and demanding answers from anxious frightened parts when we are not a trained person is picking at scabs and can re-traumatise us. It is likely you have wounds there the anxious parts are trying to protect you from or worse the anxious part is an open bleeding wound. As I said, I suggest you first learn bottom up somatic techniques like breathing control that will work for you. If you have tried before and failed get back on the bike. It's the right one. Be gentle and compassionate towards your anxiety. It is trying to protect you.
In one way I am astonished that none of your therapists has been able to get across to you properly yet that we are not our burdens. Like anxiety. This is true of many therapists and clients though.",bipolar-disorder

End Point,"I've been circling the drain for a long time now and received news yesterday that my last gambit at holding on, waiting for better, striving for hope has failed. There's a project I need to complete to meet my responsibilities to a friend, but right now I'm trying to set things up, make those end of life plans to make things easier for those I'll leave behind. I think I would have liked to have told people in my own time and in my own way. I reached out to my dad's therapist to ask her to leave appointments available to him after I'm gone and of course as a mental health professional she deemed I was in crisis and called my father who is bitter and angry and ""feels abandonned."" I really wish that could have been put off. This isn't about hurting him, it's about ending my long struggle with pain and confusion and despair and self-loathing. I've tried to explain that this is the best decision for someone who is draining him financially and emotionally. To ease the burden I represent in his life. I wish he would accept that. Instead I'll be plastering on ""happy face"" for the next while until it's time, but his distress is deeply upsetting me when really all I wanted was to make arrangements to be sure as few people are inconvienenced as possible and achieve some measure of peace. I've accepted my choice; it's not easy. But it is time. What I don't want is to spend this time being tormented by other people's anger, grief, hurt, what-have-you.
I don't need futile interventions. I need acceptance and to be able to say goodbye without being overwhelmed by other people's desires. This isn't crisis. This is acceptance and resignation. I have been struggling for so long and I'm just so tired. I hurt all the time. I'm sad and anxious all the time. The incidence of panic attacks has increased to the point where I feel I'm going to die horribly of a heart attack several times a day. That's not living.
When I was first diagnosed, a friend at the time dismissed my depressive cycles noting that she knew a man who lived with his bipolar and was a distinguished professor. She implied it was all very manageable and to get over myself. I have thought about that conversation many times over the years as I push myself to maintain some sort of stability. But I am so tired of fighting my mind. So tired of feeling overwhelmed. So very tired of seeing my efforts fail and plans come to naught. I am tired of being a burden on my family and the cause of my father's tears and my mother's scorn.
I have no answers, no solutions. I have no prospects and no purpose. I have tried. And, as with so many other things, I have failed. In some ways having decided on an end point is reassuring. And I hope to mitigate some damage before it's over. Death doesn't happen to the dying. It happens to the survivors. I think end-stage planning is kinder than presenting those survivors with a sudden shock and devestation. I just wish there could be greater acceptance of what I need to do. It's not easy saying goodbye. It's not easy letting go of those slight gimmers of hope - the wish that I could be better, that things could get better if I keep trying. At some point, I think you have to admit that you may have won some battles but you're fighting a losing war.
I have my own grieving to do - regret for missed opportunities and failed potential. It's part of the acceptance procress and is tiring in and of itself. I don't know, maybe I'm looking for some small measure of comfort and seeking peace in these last days. I'm trying to compartmentalise - address the practicalities as needed but also embrace my own sadness at what is my ultimate failure. I'd like to leave without being overwhelmed by hurt and guilt. I'd like to have a bit of assurance that it's okay.",bipolar-disorder

Feeling better today,"By some miracle, all theee dogs let me sleep till 11am. I woke to my sister and nephew coming into my room. They thought a visit would be nice. I've been cleaning and crafting. I hung some pictures in my rooom. I am running out of wall space. I stopped at the dollar store and on the way to the check out I walked through the garden aisle and they had ceramic cows so I bought a few and a llama and some unicorns for my fairy garden which actually looks more like a farm due to all the animals.  still having some suicidal thoughts though not nearly as heavy as they have been. I am gonna clean the kitchen and bathroom and walk my dogs. I'm about to leave to meet a good friend who is in town for a funeral. That will be nice. anyway, I took Librium this morning and maybe it has finally kicked  in after six doses. That is a relief. but today so far is a better day. ",bipolar-disorder
Madness,"I feel like I am stuck in a tornado and I am floating around in the twister. I hate the up and down. I just had a very manic week and now my mind is just freaking. I want to cry for no apparent reason, I have no appetite, I am irritable and it seems like this is when everyone wants to pick me apart. I have been with my husband for 15 years and he still does not seem to know my illness. I know my triggers or signs. He should as well. He gets angry with me for these ups and downs and it just confuses me in my head more because I think I am handling myself ok and he does not. He will not talk to me for long periods of time. I will tell him... I am feeling sad and confused. He wants to know about what... I do not know... it's just how I feel and he does not understand. I feel so alone in the world. Always taking care of everyone else even when I am manic or depressed. I am getting tired. Somedays I just want to be left alone to cry or laugh or scream.

Question Need new pdoc,"The situation is below.  The question is: 
If have any suggestions on finding an new pdoc I would appreciate a response.
I currently have no mental health provider. I have meds refills but am on no mood stabelizer. :( I've had my records sent to a provider and been refused as they said that my issues are not within their purview. 
I'd rather know this upfront and be refused rather than accepted as a patient when my issues are not within their purview.  
I went online and got my insurance information of accepted proivders.  I also got a recommendation for a couple of other providers to check out from the office that refused me.  
The problem is they (the office that refused me) want to stick me (read this as recommended a couple of pdocs) with someone who is experienced with eating disorders. 
I DO NOT WANT THEIR HELP WITH IT!!!
I've had ""HELP"" before and all it does is trigger my eating disorder to the extreme. 
I will NOT make FULL menus and log my food.
I can plan on dinners and have foods around that are not binge foods to have for lunch and dinner BUT if I try and log my food it triggers the disorder.
I've lost 44 pounds so far and am trying my best NOT to let this situation lead me to eating things I don't need to eat. 
I am also using the skills I have learned since being diagnosed bipolar 15 or so years ago to help with the anxiety and emotional regulation.  Read this as I haven't gone off on anyone yet LOL :).
If I can't laugh at it I'll cry over it so I CHOOSE HUMOR and to be easily amused with what goes on around me.
I don't want to go without meds. I just don't want to be stuck with someone who thinks they can treat my ED and the bipolar when all I want help with is the bipolar. Until I want help no one will be able to help me.  The only help I want is the Naltrexone for the ED. It helps cut down on the cravings so much.
They even tried to refer me to someone I'd already seen and vehimently dislike.  I would rather do without meds than see that person. NOT!!! I really, really dislike him as a person and a provider.  I won't go into it more than that. I'm choosing to see the humor in it though. 
The thing is not to get too worked up about this as it will only cause anxiety and emotional disregulation which will in turn lead to the ED. 
Right now I am choosing to deal with the stress of the situation by reading which is a healthy coping mechanism.
I hope that when I do get another provider (trying to be optomistic) I will be able to discontinue the Seroquel as I have found that influences my eating habits and my blood sugars.  My A1C went down after the Seroquel was cut in half. Now I have trouble with low glucose levels.",bipolar-disorder
New to group and just lost job,"What a title and way to start, huh? At least I have my sense of humor (for now). Have BP2 and before I was diagnosed I was in crisis (which I didn't really know at the time) got 2 strikes at work and then ended up in a psych ward b/c I was actively suicidal (2 years ago) that is where I was diagnosed with BP2. Have been on meds since then. No incidents last year, but just last week I got a 3rd strike and was let go. 
No savings, barely scraping by, moving back to my parents house 400 miles away. Earliest I can break my lease on my apartment is 60 days. So, every day - just do a little bit more to facilitate a move. Trying to sell virtually ALL my stuff to make a little money to live on. 
Trying to stay positive, taking deep breaths at times, keeping busy, (sometimes I sit and stare at a wall though). Practice forgiveness every day by repeating my mantras. Seeing my psychiatrist every 2 weeks (at least I have health insurance (for now)).
Just helps to type out the struggle I am having. Sometimes strangers can offer something friends and family cannot.

TW Death would be kinder,"I'm tired. My parents are pissed at me cause I slept all day. It's not my fault. I mean, I took melatonin at 4 so I could fall asleep. Better than the bottle of lithium I was contemplating taking. Got so bad today I called my pastor and told her I am actively suicidal at this point. She wants me to tell my parents but I can't bring myself too. Mom is stressed about school and dad is stressed about money. I don't want to worry them or burden them. I did tell my therapist so she is aware but I can't get in to see her till next Tuesday. I just don't know what to do. so pastor talked to me on the phone for fifteen minutes at four then checked in by text a few minutes ago. my dad actually threw a tablet at me tonight cause he was so mad. Why tell them how I feel? They're so sick of me being sick all the time. Death would be kinder. Pastor says if I'm not netter in a day to tell my parents. I will leave that to her though I think.

benadryl and hypomania,"yesterday went to clbhouse about 11am staye until 2 or 3 i was painting butterflies just kept printing and painting until 3am went to bed could not sleep got up did some more went back to bed 4am slept til 8am got dressed went to craft club did more butterflies 12pm to 3 pm

it really was getting bad did some more until 5pm decided to take nap took half a benadryl for itch and i slept wow took a 2 hr nap when i woke up i felt more relaxed starting to paint more but at a less driven rate taking snack breaks ate supper went out and smoked etc

my eyes were swollen and sore gritty and really tearing so i am wondering if the benadryl relaxes me and i find it does
does it make sense to use it as a tranquilizer and bring myself down with it
if i take a nap force myself or just stop i come down a little to a more managable state this seems to be the only thing that works

I have always tried to take difficult AP and IB or Honors classes and all of my classes this year are advanced and I wonder if I can even do it anymore, I have a lot of work to make for that I missed during my depressive episode where I could not even get up out of bed and I'm trying to keep a positive mindset and remember that this person did not have ill intentions and even encouraged me after I explained why I keep having these relapses.

Feeling okay and blessed,"Last night I realized I was mentally very restless heading towards mania. I was up late and looking on-line for any support I could find. I almost applied to a Asexual dating service. For I would like romance but nothing more. I haven't had romance in a long long time and I think I would like it. So I sort of frantically kept trying to look at different sites and determine the best course of action. And then I realized that no action is an action. In other words, I don't have to act on those feelings,however great they may be at times, I don't have to feel desperate or forsaken. So I closed my I-pad and went to sleep in less than 2 minutes. Thank you Father for always being with me in good times, in bad times. In great suffering I am able to hear your still quiet voice calming me down and being with me in this journey.

Med Side Effects,"Another issue I have been dealing with is side effects from medication. I have been on almost everything and right now I am on Depakote. Has anyone ever been on Depakote and dealt with extreme sleepiness and hot flashes? I've talked to two pharmacists and one says the hot flashes are caused by the Depakote and the other says they aren't (thinks they are due to the pill). A doctor I talked to thinks it is NOT due to the pill. They are really making me miserable whenever I am inside somewhere. It is winter here and I can't wear shoes with socks or boots or anything because I get so hot sometimes, even if I am doing nothing. I used to be cold all of the time. I also sleep all of the time and if I am not sleeping I am wanting to sleep. I went to bed around 9:30 on Friday night and slept pretty much all day until 5 pm yesterday, then went to bed again around 9:30/10:00. I know this can alo be due to depression, but I was really sleepy even when I wasn't depressed. I can only do this on weekends as I work during the week. However, it makes me feel lousy when I don't get anything done because I have slept all day. I also come home and sleep for an hour or more after work every day so that I can make it until bedtime, which is around 9:30. Has anyone had experience with this?

I had the tetanus shot in 2016 I just got a flu shot in September. I guess with me working at a hospital their going ape s@$&% with these vaccines and immunizations. The drug test tests for 
Cannabinoids, opiates, amphetamines,  cocaine, phencyclide, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, propoxyphene, methamphetamines,  oxycodone
So I listed all my meds, whats weird is I don't recall the pharmacy testing for  benzos,
My medication cocktail naltrexone 50 mg welbutrin 150 mg seroquel 50 mg, klonopin 1 mg, ambien 10 mg carbamazepine 200 mg lamictical 100, saxenda 3 mg, naproxen 500 mg, lomaira 8 mg
I never tell employers  I'm bipolar but I feel I have too. Because I'm on so many meds. I don't know what naltrexone is but. I know my doctor put me on it to match my welbutrin because its it's basically concrave diet pill. Since lowering seroquel from 800 mg to 25 mg I'm now at my orginal weight before starting seroquel in 2015 104 pounds. I started out at 206 in January 2019 the lower my pdoc lowered seroquel weight fell off literally. Then I went on mission to get off seroquel because I've always been thin. So with medication as an aid but really of my dedication to eating right and yoga. I dropped quickly. My endocrinologist and pdoc worked together. My endodocrinogist said she has never seen a patient do what I did. I literally eat like a rabit its like howvI was in 2015. When I was put on seroquel my belly was a bottomless pit that could never be full. I will never be fat again and never go beyond 25 mg of seroquel. So I don't know what half these drugs are on this list. But benzos????? So with what I take now I hate to tell them I'm BP plus I'm not sure what ambien and lomaira fall under.

I can happily say That I didn't expect to get to get better this soon, but I am glad Because I can see now everything that happened and I can start to. Learn more about manic episodes and how quick it can turn to that.

Bedtime?,I feel like anymore I live for bedtime. All day I count down the hours till 8 pm when I can take my meds and retreat to my bedroom. I take my meds and spend an hour reading or on my phone. It's only around 9-9:30 when I finally drift off to sleep. My puppy wakes me up around 5am to go outside then I go back to bed till 8:30-9am. I'm wondering what time do you go to bed? What is your bedtime routine and what time do you usually wake up?,bipolar-disorder
seamless blending finally,"finally learned the art of seamless blending thanks to my 2 new markers they are sets spectrum noir and chameleon markers they are a little pricey but that is how you get quality work sometimes you get what you pay for

i am not buying more until next month 1 set a month but they are excellent and i can now blend with my other markers as well

i also mix different brands so have a tremendous supply and do not really need any more

i am becoming an artist just like grandma moses which i hate to think of myself as a grandma but age is just a number anyway and my talents are nothing compared to hers

i am loving what i am doing and even though i may not be a true artist i am a good colorist now this is almost magical i am feeling and doing things that i never dreamed i could do or would i have learned to live bipolar this is progress the disorder does not rule the way i am living completely there are times when i have to put out a little more effort like getting up and dressed and going to craft club even the doctors but i am managing to do it

i may not eat or sleep or clean and do laundry and all the rest the way i want but i am doing it despite my ultra rapid moodswings i have to say that i am now proud of the way i am living with my disability i have made many friends here who care about me admire me and some who are jealous of my creative talent but i am able to hold my head up and feel good about who i am 

there is a parable in the bible about hiding your talents not using them and i can say that now i am using my gift to the fullest and for the first time in my life sharing them and it feels good",bipolar-disorder
Feeling hopeless,"Despite having a good mood most every day, the future still looks bleak. My fine year old niece just asked me when I'm gonna get my own house. I told her never. I feel this is true. I feel I will never have another relationship with a man. I feel I will never love again. I feel I will never get off of disability. I feel I will die by my own hand within the next ten years. My depression is situational not because my meds aren't working. My meds have me stable but the future continues to scare me and I don't know what to do. I've been having these thoughts for a while but I am generally able to push them away so I have told my therapist recently that suicidal thoughts still come. I'm so afraid my drug test is gonna come back positive for weed even though I haven't used since December. I have decided to give a full two weeeks notice at my current job so that means working two jobs for two weeks.  I am scared and nervous and stressed. My mom is also stressed so I don't want to tell her how I'm feeling. I can tell you all though and I know you will understand. It's hard. I know I am so blessed and so loved but it only makes me feel worse. Like I am taking for granted all that I have. map this is how I feel and I just wanted to share with you all. ",bipolar-disorder

stress,"think i have learned how to combat stress and calm myself down when becoming stressed
not sure how really but i find myself stopping and clearing my thoughts and not concentrating on anything helps me fight the emotions anger especially and lessen the irritability 
i find when i do this often during the day i itch less and so scratch less from the psoriasis this is great and the psoriasis is much much better it is clearing up i am using coal tar solution mixed with coconut oil and tea tree oil and now urea cream this combination actally works

the ability to lessen stress will help it to clear up i find that now i can just do nothing when something bothers me sometimes i smoke i go outside and walk around look at the sky shadows of the trees at night the moon my companion and i calm down it is like magic

i still am irritable at times when in a group then i remove myself and step outside but it is becoming easier i color and that helps i cannot meditate but i can blank out my mind and find some relief from the constant thinking my sleep is better not more but quality is better so i am feeling good about myself right about now

I don't have money to give my dad for my phone and car insurance so he is covering me thankfully. I had to borrow money from mom for gas also till next week. I feel like a deadbeat. Really it's not my fault. There was no way to plan ahead due to my current job not giving me enough hours to scrape by on. March should put me back on my feet at least with regular hours.

I'm blessed with good friends that accept me - but that feeling you don't want to talk to anyone and then you wish you could talk and just get it out - well, thats why I came back - I feel safe here and know you understand and care.   Thank all of you here, for reading this far and keeping this group a living good place to come.

So many changes,"Hey its been awhile since I posted. I'm doing ok. I've been extremely stressed since starting my new job at the hospital. I lost 15 pounds. I'm 100 pounds. All I can say is I made it and I'm stable at this job. I'm grateful  God has gotten me through at work. Its been 2 months that I been working at the hospital. I'm in the cardiology department and I literally had rings under my eyes. I'm a slow learner but I'm finally getting  it. I'm not a fan of my coworkers for reasons I'm not going to discuss. I got rid of the rings under my eyes. I'm finally getting to sleep more and soundly. However there are a handful of coworkers that have been a blessing. Its great working for a hospital. I don't want to learn about any other organ other than the damn heart. Its been SOOO much! I finally changed my number and bought a new phone. I still keep the location off on my tablet. It will be 5 months since I left my abusive ex. He last contacted me that I know of November 13th. I'm not sure if he has tried to contact me since. My concerns and fears are heightened because he said if he were to come after anyone he'd wait months or a year(s) that way no one would suspect he did it. So from what I've learned most victims of domestic violence when they leave its early on that a victim should be worried. I recently bought 2 rape alarms that are pretty loud and hurt my ears. It will be 5 months on the 23rd since I left.  I finished 12 sessions of therapy. I finished my book psychopath free. Now I'm reading the gift of fear. I'm on a dating site but I'm in no rush to date. Is it me or is this A LOT OF CHANGE!? New place, single again, new  job, new phone number,.... I'm exhausted ",bipolar-disorder

"TW, Sudden downturn.","Internet connection is intermittent at best with the raging of storm ciara but I would very much appreciate some support right now. I ended up cutting for the first time in many months on friday night out of the blue. It had been a fairly traumatic few weeks with a lot happening including the death of an old school friend and a friend's sister and some very frustrating hospital appointments. Friday though I had a gastroscopy done and every single person I met from the minute I got to the day clinic was unbelievably kind and nice to me throughout and even though the sedation did not kick in until long after they were finished it was all fine and I had a wonderful hour's sleep while there. I had dinner already prepating in the slow cooker so we could eat a delicious meal when we got home. Unfortunately, the only person I could get to take me to the hospital was wolfgang and he was in top 'mean mode' for the evening and I heaved a big sigh of relief when he went off to bed and he has now gone back home. hopefully I won't need help to get anywhere in the near future.
They found a lot of inflammation in my stomach and took biopsies of both that and the oesophagus so I have to wait for those results. They gave me a script for the stomach but I was too late for the pharmacy by the time we got home and they don't open again until monday. I am grateful though for at least a partial answer to some of my discomfort.
It was TJ's birthday on saturday (he would have been 63yrs old) and I would imagine that had a lot to do with my feeling so lost and alone right now.
I have lit a nice cosy fire now and am about to go have a roast pork dinner that I cooked last night so with any luck a nice evening will go a long way towards restoring my euiblibrium.
thanks in advance for even reading this far.

meta-analysis – light txt for BP depression.," Light therapy holds promise for people with bipolar disorder
Feb 3, 2020    |   For more information, contact Kerry Blackadar
Light therapy, consisting of daily exposure to bright, artificial light, is already a recognized line of treatment for people affected by seasonal and nonseasonal depressive disorder.
But much less is known about the potential benefits of light therapy for people with bipolar disorder, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.

Dr. Raymond Lam
In a meta-analysis recently published in The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, Dr. Raymond Lam — a professor in the department of psychiatry, director of the Mood Disorders Centre at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, and research scientist at the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute — took a closer look at the growing body of research in this area.
Lam and his colleagues found that, when it comes to reducing symptoms of bipolar depression, light therapy holds promise.
What impact does light therapy have on people with bipolar disorder?
We found seven published trials of light therapy compared to a placebo in people with bipolar depression. When we statistically combined the results of the studies, overall, there was significant improvement in depressive symptoms with bright light compared to placebo conditions.
We also found that bright light was well tolerated in the studies, with few people having to stop the study for side effects or other reasons. Importantly, light therapy did not cause a switch from depression to mania, as can happen with antidepressants in people with bipolar disorder.
How does light therapy work?
We don’t know exactly how light therapy works for seasonal and nonseasonal depression, and whether it is the same mechanism for bipolar depression.
What we do know is that light acts through the eyes to regulate the biological clock located in a tiny region of the brain, known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We also know that there are disturbances in the biological clock that affect circadian (daily) rhythms in people with bipolar disorder, including hormonal rhythms, sleep, cognition, and other behaviours. However, we don’t know if regulating circadian rhythms is the reason why light therapy works as an antidepressant.
Other studies have shown that light can affect the major neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, involved in mood and behaviour, such as serotonin and dopamine. So, light therapy may work similarly to antidepressants by directly acting on these neurotransmitters.
Why is it important to know how light therapy affects people with bipolar disorder?
There are fewer available treatments for bipolar depression compared to other types of depression, so it is important to find new effective treatments. Antidepressant medications are not clearly effective and they may worsen mood cycling in people with bipolar disorder. Also, many people with bipolar disorder must take other medications such as mood stabilizers. That’s why it is important to determine if a non-medication treatment, like light therapy, is effective, because it can be used without worrying about drug interactions.
What’s next?
Although we found positive results, we also found limitations in the previous studies. For example, only small numbers of people were studied, there were many different types and “doses” of light therapy used, the follow-up periods were very short, and most patients were taking other medications for bipolar disorder.
That’s why moving forward, we need more research with larger samples of patients to conclusively show that light therapy is effective for bipolar depression. We also need to determine the optimal conditions for light therapy, including what wavelength of light works best, how bright the light needs to be, and how long patients should use the light.
Since bipolar disorder is a chronic condition, we also need to further examine how light should be used for maintenance treatment to prevent future depressive episodes.

Thank you,"Just wanted to send a very very warm Thankyou for all your support.  I'm not doin well at all it just feels like I'm floating through the day it's hard to explain maybe more like my mind body and soul aren't connected not even close. Since Sat there has been a steady stream of friends coming by which is just exhausting. I try to disappear but someone always knows where I am unfortunately. I know there are just concerned but I just want peace. I'm not sure that is even possible. Luckily I do have friends that are watching my kids because I can't deal with everything I can't really take care of myself let alone babies. I don't feel safe to be alone but that is all I want right now. Yesterday I went to the store and ended up parking more on the sidewalk and didn't remember driving let alone how I got on the sidewalk. I just remember talking to police and they moved my car and drove me home. Today I'm not much better I'm supposed to see therapist tomorrow but I just don't want to go she probably would take a look at me and try to get me to go to hospital and right now I just don't care but hospital is the last place I want to be. As people who have been there for me that is the last place to get my head screwed on. I need place that is quiet and peaceful and that is not a hospital. I have been suicidal before but this is just like getting the air taken out of you.im just numb and that is a huge difference  I'm probably making no sense what else is new.

Why so codependent and frozen???,"I just need a place to ramble. Why must I be like this even when I'm trying so hard to grow? 

About me- 43 years old with cPTSD from child abuse and trauma, Bipolar I and GAD so already my brain is all mishmash.

I'm working on independence and not searching for a caregiver anymore. I want a partner in life not someone who fixes or completes me.

I've been single for about a year now and very cautious in my dating.

So anyway, I've been careful with not being too eager in new connections. I meet someone online, we've had two dates that went well. Communication has been good but he has also been busy. A family member passed away in between our two dates so he was out of state for two days. We've had a fair amount of texts once or twice a day all week but now....

He acknowledged last night he's been out of touch and that he would call today. I have received one text but it's now 9:30 pm and I haven't heard from him. 

So my mind is racing and I'm ""frozen"". 

Why hasn't he called (because his life is crazy busy right now and maybe he went out after work, we've only been on two dates).

Do we have plans this weekend? (I'm totally fine if we don't but I also want to know.)

My rational mind has all the correct thoughts but I just can't get rid of the feeling energy. I can't concentrate on chores or art or even tv. My brain just keeps ruminating. 

I'm also getting a little cranky.

The thing is, 2 dates!!! That's all. I ""think"" I like him but we are just learning each other. I definitely am not in love.... yet (?).

It's the attention though, I'm like an addict, waiting for the phone to ring to give me my attention fix...",bipolar-disorder

Quitting my job for the sake of my grades?,"Hey all!
After weeks of prodding and asking, I finally got my schedule for the semester (I work for my university). I was a little miffed when I got the schedule seeing that it was effective the very next day and I had to shift my whole schedule around (meetings with Profs. and TAs, study groups, recitations, club activities, and scheduled lunches with friends) In little over 4 hours. I had my whole next week figured out but this threw a huge wrench into everything. I'm working a lot more hours than last semester after specifically asking for fewer hours this semester. I just feel very frustrated and ignored.  
On top of that, I'm working so many hours at random intervals almost every day that I find it difficult to find time to do homework or study. I got a zero on a chemistry quiz and cried in front of the TA which was super embarrassing. School is the most important thing in my life and I don't see a point in having a job if it puts my education in jeopardy. But money is also important. I can live off my savings for a little, but I'm not sure how far it will take me. 
The question is do I ask (again) for a cut in hours or do I quit my job entirely? I don't like working there because it's not with my school (engineering) but with the science and education school. So I'm not learning relevant skills to my major and I feel like I'm wasting time whenever I am at work. 
But again MONEY IS NICE.

"No, I am NOT pregnant!!","Before I started meds, my body was great. Ok. Lie. I was a twig. At 5'2 and 90 lbs I looked anorexic. People always commented on how tiny I was and I had to shop in the juniors section. Since starting meds I have gained 60lbs and I now weigh 153. i am mostly happy with my body except for my belly. I look like I am 5 months pregnant. I know it's the zyprexa and I won't stop taking it because, well, it works. I used to be able to wear skin tight shirts and form fitting dresses but now with my belly I wear clothes that are a bit looser. I still wear tighter dresses but I am careful to suck in my belly. with summer approaching I want to wear cute clothes an itty bitty swimsuits. But I am so self conscious!! Ive actually had people ask me how far along I am or if this is my first baby. Especially when I tote my nieces around. It gets depressing. Are you comfortable in your body? How do you deal with the med weight gain?",bipolar-disorder
Learned Helplessness,"I think I have learned helplessness.  I heard the term awhile back. Here's the Oxford definition: a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness, arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed. It is thought to be one of the underlying causes of depression.
I have an appointment with my therapist this week so I'm going to ask her about this and what can be done about it.
This is probably why I haven't been able to move forward like I planned to do.  I just experience tremendous fear when I try to make a change about most things.

Changing my sleep habits,"As Oldercper mentioned, ""Sleep Hygene"" is important. Having a regular sleep schedule is important. My sleep has been all over the place, and it's not been benifical to me. 
I have higher anxiety, then depression. I have changed my eating habits though. I don't over eat very much. I really don't watch exacty what I eat though. I still have my fast food fix every so often (not every day). Alcohol (beer) I rarely have now. If I do, its only three beers. I mainly like the taste. I don't really get a buzz from three  beers. Also, I like the change of venue. A small, local bar not very crowded close to home. 
I don't try and drink too much coffee, I do like it in the morning though to get me started. 

Sleep habits though, are important. ",bipolar-disorder

First Week of School and its going... Good?,"Hey everyone, 
The 13th was started my first week at school. I'm doing well, I got an A on a review quiz for precalculus. But I can't shake the feeling that the other shoe is about to drop. I have this feeling that everything is going to fall apart. I also have this irrational fear that they are going to kick me out of the program despite my GPA (which is good). That they are going to figure out that I'm not good at school and send me packing. 
I received good grades last semester and got into all the classes I wanted to get into, but I still feel sad about school. It's like doing good is the bare minimum and that I should be excelling. 
Does anyone else feel this way? It's like I'm happy about something but also sad and anxious about it as well?

"Rainy, Rainy Oregon","I been very depressed for over a week now.  I have been crying a lot.  I just can't help it.  Experiencing fatigue and poor coordination.  Of course having a lot fear paranoia, etc.
Lately the weather has been very rainy and gray including today.  This isn't ordinary gray days.  I'm talking about extremely gloomy and dark clouds everywhere.  The clouds just hang there heavily and dark like my mood.  I'm probably batting S.A.D.  I'm taking D3.  I bought some Valarian root for anxiety.
I called in sick at work this morning because I was so sad an weepy.  I didn't want to breakdown and cry at work, again.  I hate calling in because I'm so afraid I'll get in trouble.  However it it seems like someone calls in sick everyday that I worked.  Maybe it was just my turn.  It my 1st time calling in at this job.  I'm going to go to work tomorrow.  It will probably take every ounce of strength I have.
I hate having bp.  It has robbed me of so much.  Mental health care here in America is so lousy.  There is a lot of awareness about mental disorders but it's still expensive in many cases.  For many it's hard to get decent care.  A lot of us have a very difficult time finding support as in friends and/or family that are there for them.  Here in Oregon there is only 1 hospital that has a psych ward.  Most of the mental hospitals have been shutdown.  I know a lot of them were like prisons but it was someplace to go.  With a few simple changes they could of been improved dramatically but nobody wanted to pay for improvements.
So now I suffer in varying degrees.  My future looks bleak and that's one of things that scares me.  The other thing that scares is being completely abandoned by everyone.  The thought of being completely rejected is terrible.
It's been a very difficult life for me.",bipolar-disorder

Sleep Hygiene & Re-gaining a Proper Sleep Schedule,"Lots of folks are posting about interupted or ""flip-flopped"" sleep schedules, so I thought I'd post this again.  Kat   :0)
One of the most important sleep hygiene practices is to spend an appropriate amount of time asleep in bed, not too little or too excessive. Sleep needs vary across ages and are especially impacted by lifestyle and health.  Good sleep hygiene practices include:
It can take time and repetition to “re-train” your body and brain into a good Sleep Hygiene cycle, it does not happen overnight.  So, don’t give up, be persistent.  Sleep Hygiene does work if you keep with it and make it a priority.
If you're sleep schedule is ""Upside Down"" and your sleeping during the day and not at night, you may have to suffer through a day of tiredness, to make yourself sleep at night.  Keep yourself busy with activities, go outside for Fresh Air to wake up your senses, get Sunlight.  Stay up until at least 8:00p.m., well into Dark, then the next night stay up later, continue until you get to a regular bed time and your waking at a normal time in the morning.
It takes work, but you can fix your Sleep Schedule and Hygiene.
Take care!",bipolar-disorder

Pissed off. Need advice.,"So my youngest sister Lynn video called me tonight. She received a letter addressed to me care of her at her address. I was intrigued. Who knows me but not my address. It was hand written. A letter from my biological father who I have not seen in 12 years nor spoken to. It said 
""Dear [kisses],I love you and miss you.
Love, Dad""
first off, I have been referring to this man by his first name for over a decade. He lost all rights to be called ""Dad"" by me. The man I call ""Dad"" is my stepfather. He picked up the pieces after I was left shattered by bio father. Bio father abused and neglected me and my siblings the entire time he was in my life. The last time I spoke to him I told him I didn't want him in my life. You'd think that would stop all contact. He sent me several letters over the years one I read one I left unopened and remained as ""return to sender"". I want to send him a letter detailing the abuse he put me through. That because of him I am terrified of getting close to men. That I have ptsd partly due to the abuse I suffered at his hands. HOW DARE HE CONTACT ME AFTER I MADE IT CLEAR TO HIM I DONT WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM!!! I am steamed right now. Lynn has a very good relationship with him. She doesn't remember the abuse and is vulnerable and easy to manipulate. She fell for the lies. On one hand I am so glad she doesn't remember the abuse. On the other I wish she remembered because she would know what a horrible human being this man is. so I'm wondering would you send a letter back again expressing your disdain and explain you remember the abuse, or leave it be?

You tell yourself he's got a care he went to school for all them years isn't  because he wants to  help and make people feel well. This is what I tell myself about my doctors. Well that is what I used to tell myself about my doctor's up until last night.  After I share this story I would like to hearback on what you will do I'm going to keep it short. I have been under my psychiatrist's care at this point six months. My first appointment session first to assess the bipolar that was out of control  to find medication to help get back in control.in the processed of trying to accomplish I'll coming in every 6 weeks tell him the side effects of medicines were working and just to switch to another one  understanding psych was trying to dealing with my bipolar. A friend give me an adderal God I love that. want to next appointment to psychiatrist I asked if he coud prescribed Adderall for me my poff script in my hand. I really didn't know anything about it I know it give you energy kind of remind me of a Flintstone vitamins  took it and move on I have about six weeks infested with you the adderal and loving it so much so I wasn't satisfied with the diagnosis two 30 mg twice a day so avoiding the voice of logic in my head I listen to my drug addicts voice in my head. Buy it time we reached end of August early October I am addicted and I am abusing my increase went from 2 to 30 mg the day to 180 to 200 a day but but increasingly this point wasn't making me run short because of the lack of attention that was given to my sessions so it's pretty easy to get more psychiatrist when writing out 3 months scripts which they would overlap each other making it easy to fill double prescriptions in one month.still not satisfied or feeling sick obviously looking at went  into his office told him my daughter ripped up and threw out my prescriptions he didn't even blink  wrote me three more. I know my brains a little fried from all of the Adderall abuse but I do know this much the psychiatrist responsibility when he prescribes anything to his patient is to refresh himself again with the patient's records and then visually and verbally do a quick assessment of your patient because he's on  adderal that's protocol. I know not even that was done just hand me the replacement s. It is January I was reading an article adderal who should be prescribed and who should not get adderal bipolar are not never allowed to be prescribed adderal and patient with history of alcohol and drug abuse red flag you don't give that patient at all. I think it was September the pharmacy must have called the psychiatrist to inform him that I was fillimg large amounts and in short time . I wish I was a fly on the wall in his office when he got that call if I close my eyes I can pretty much see this all going on the psychiatrist faces panic and thinking o shit. Once he did come up with a quick idea it was so pathetic I couldn't believe it myself keep in mind I'm in patient I've been abusing adderal l for a good eight months now his solution to the problem since he was the one that caused it by not being a psychiatrist watching out for the pacient. He got that phone call from the pharmacy informing him of the refills by me so frequentl .and this is how my psychiatrist show his concern getting that information about his patient he thought a solution to solve the problem was to just drop me from his care. So much for that idea that they become shink caus they care about people. Just laying in the hospital bed don't think for one minute I am not only my sharing this. It's just that I'm laying here alone really sick bring your wife up I can have in my head when I'm at the psychiatrist and he was going to become my shrink it was because he care I wanted me to get better and he would keep an eye on me for changes due to medicine or request morning medicine it would have only taken one second to open my record and he would have said and I cant give you at Adderall after taking 2 seconds to refresh my memory it's right here in your records you have history drug and alcohol abuse or more importantly than that you've been with me for 8 months while I'm treating you for bipolar and everybody knows you can't give bipolar people at all that's every people except for me I didn't know. Just to be clear The scenario 1 the bipolar disorder un medicated for this disorder shuffling along with PTSD and fightin to keep my sorority which I believe at that time I had about 18 months sober psychiatrist all of his certificates his  awardsw for all of that knowledge and training he has this beautiful relaxing office so professionally decorated. With the look on his face that saying I'm here cuz I care about your well-being.


The last 3 months or so September October November December I've been psychological and  physical  orin hell  me and under no care of a psychiatrist totally out of control abusing adderal in the amount of 150 to 200 milligrams 
a day  30 milligram tabs being in this  situation ex actively drinking verbally physically abusi hanging  on by string I cried so loud for help last night January 4th 8:30  admitted into the emergency room severe symptoms Adderall overdose. hearing voices heart racing sweating a nervous tick that I developed in my whole body I knew if I didn't get here there is a good possibility I was going to wind up in a coma or stroke. The thing that I gar waving the white flag just about a week ago I got help I was honest and I was holding on to the store that they will get me in a program I think drugs and alcohol abuse can under the care of a psychiatrist oh well care about my well-being and treat me for my PTSD my bipolar disorder and participate can you get dress mine road recovery. I don't know how long I'm going to be in the hospital doctor very concerned hoping I did not cause a stroke or go into a coma be watching very closely I feel very vulnerable brainit's buzzing I always used to think growing up with an alcoholic mother and being showing the ropes so young in life then I would die by my own hand. But neve cross my mind when I'm letting my guards down Italking about painful deep personal things it's because I'm such a fool I thought my psychiatrist would be the safe place
I do hold myself responsible and I seem to be getting my punishment and then some as I'm laying in this hospital bed migraine what damage I did a how long I'm going to be here when will treatment start but I definitely feel my psychiatrist it's definitely responsible for this all happening love to hear feedback.

Online dating sucks,"as a guy with BP it really sucks. last time I tried I got zero responses from the 70 women I messaged. Now I'm trying again, and it just feels shitty. I'm expected to read through every line of every profile of every woman I'm interested in, then write a personalized message that is thoughtful and interesting. meanwhile women put in almost zero effort. I have only ever gotten a handful of likes from people I have nothing in common with. absolutely zero messages. I guess it's nice that a few women clicked the like button, but typing out anything at all was too much work I suppose. I may not be a 10, but neither am I a 1. I don't go for women that are what one might consider out of my league. The one thing that I assume is holding me back is the fact that I say upfront that I'm disabled. I don't say why. I figure they can ask.

Money Anxiety etc.,"I've always been thrifty when it comes to money.  I don't think I'm cheap, I'm just into buying things I don't think I will use.  Also, I will buy a cheaper brand of something over a name brand usually.
I'm not sure why I became this way.  Maybe it was from hearing my parents discuss money issues.  There were some lean times in our family.  It's in many of the shows we watch.  There are people talking about money problems.
I'm extremely afraid of losing or running out of money.  Of course, becoming homeless is a huge fear of mine.
I wish we didn't have to depend on money so much to get goods and services.  I think the barter system is still a good idea.  I think most people can come up with something they can trade with.
I have many fears.  This is just a small sample.  I see my therapist tomorrow.  Hugs.

I have to find a therapist,"I had this one guy therapist. We did not connect really well. He was inside the office of my Pdoc. I only had three sessions with him. As a guy, I don't really like talking about my feelings with another guy. A fellow dude. Does that seem odd? I honestly would feel more comfotable talking about my feelings with a woman. 
No, I don't want to hit on my potential woman therapist. I feel that for me its eaiser to talk with a woman about feelings. I feel feelings are more girly. I know that men have feelings too. All humans do. I like my general doctor to be a guy. After all hes got to give me physical checkups. That is ok for me. But with feelings, and emotions...dunno. I rather talk to a woman. 
I feel women for the most part are more compassionate and understanding. Dunno. First I have to settle my health insurance situation. Then I can decide. I am looking into many therapy sessions though. ",bipolar-disorder

Terrified of school. Need advice,I start school next week. It's 8-430 January 6-22. I have to be up at 530am which seems impossible. I am not a morning person. I won't be able to see my therapist until January 23. Today was my last session till then and I am so afraid I'll over sleep and miss class. They lock the door at 8am and there is no entrance or makeup. It's a 45 minute drive. So far I know I will pack my lunch the night before and lay out my clothes at night. Mom will take care of the big dogs for me and I will take care of Annie and Rocket in the morning. I couldn't handle a full time course in college and I can't handle a full time job. How will I handle two weeks of full time class?! I'm terrified. my therapist and I discussed how I can take care of myself during those two weeks. So I asked my baby sister to be my cheerleader and to send me encouraging texts during school weeks. so we discussed and I said I can treat myself to ice cream once. A hot bubble bath. What else can I do to take care of myself? Also if y'all can encourage me as well cause I need all the encouragement I can get. my therapist said if she didn't believe I can do this she would have said so long ago. I actually called her a liar which she said she never lied to me. What is wrong with me? This is fear. Help?!,bipolar-disorder

My Crappy Life,"I'm depressed and my anxieties are on high alert.  My brain feels like it's just spin around with a bunch of my fears.
My 21 yr old son has Asperger's and we live with his paternal grandmother.  Both of them are difficult.  His grandmother got mad at him for something minor and said he ruined Christmas.
I'm even more stressed out.  I would like to move my son and I out of here but it's so hard to find someplace affordable.  Also, moving scares to he'll out me for some reason.  I'm going talk to my therapist about this.
I feel like I'm running around in circles because I can't come up with realistic solution to my problem.  I've been on a low income house waiting list for 2 yrs now.  Who knows how much longer it will be my name gets to the top of the list.
Even though I have many relatives, I doubt if the would let us stay with them even if I pay some rent.  I feel I have no place to go and it's a terrible feeling.
I can't deal with much more.  I could keel over and die right now.  My whole life has been miserable.  I just want to be done.  Rarely does anything work out for.  I've almost always had to settle for less because what I wanted wasn't available to me.  I'm thankful for what I have, I just wish my life was a little easier.",bipolar-disorder

I want to go home,I'm so embarrassed.  You know I have no friends LITERALLY. My neighbors are starting to figure it out. I only have 3 neighbors that have introduced themselves to me in my building. Neighbor one and her husband helped hang some stuff. My ex coworker helped me move. We talk once a year haven't  worked together since 2009. But she was an angel to help me move the things I could.  Her name is abby and when she helped me move her boyfriend BJ helped hang stuff i hadn't seen her in 2 years. But she helped. My coworker Ty installed a cabinet he moved to Texas. My neighbors assembled love seat my other niehbors hung what Ty and couldnt  abbys frend dale couldn't. Today I got my kids dresser all used.  But my neighbor couldn't help. So asked other neighbor and her husband lifted it. His wife was astonished I made it with this box to the stairwell. IT WAS HEAVY. I'm in physically in pain I'm so emotional. My philosophy was if I  can't trust  my  family who can I trust no one. This break up messed me up. I'm a girly girl UBER like I don't do hammers. Like seriously you have to scan a wall now with machine's just to hang a picture. Things like this make me miss my ex. I need a guy friend and I'm going to find one ASAP  STAT. Like I don't do air in tires. I have natural nails not nail salon nails. My neighbors I'm so greateful for. But I've got this box in my room. One thing I can say Jesus blessed  me. But I want to hang myself but before I do I need to makevsure Boopa is set up. I'm crying and all this stupid man stuff. WHO SCANS WALLS Kyle did all the man stuff. I can't believe I was strong enough to get that box i side stairwell. My body hurts don't  feel like yoga.  Hate meet up.com. Not ready to date. My neighbors obviously can tell I'm  alone. Like there is no where in the bible that says you can't off yourself. I gave the 3 neighbors  thank you cards and apple pie yesterday. No friends handy guy friend. Its a blesssing I made it to 3 months. New home new job new email new number. I just want to go home. And if any of you tell me how to use screws nails scanning thingys don't comment. I'm  physcally exhausted. I made a training manual. Finallybfriday my night stand comes friday. I really have no reason to be here. Like seriously  i know there are good men but heres the kicker im a good looking woman  34 men assume crazy.

Hospital training DRAMA,"Ok, Monday my training was an orientation at a banquet hall that talked about Jesus and Catholicism scriptures, in the first segment then after that moved on to the history of the hospital. Orientation day 2 was a half day and more history videos yada yada. Now tuesday I had to drive 30 minutes from orientation to the hospital that I will not be working at. Now I was at this hospital until Friday. This is luckily where my main boss works. 
So half day 2 I train with Anna and first comment after introductions is ""they didn't train you on these systems for this position? Oh I thought the would train you on systems"" (So already there is shade and attitude)
Mind you coming from Pharmacy corporate I learned real quick to record every ""trainee mentor"" through my phone. They don't know I'm recording them. But I can't learn from overworked people clicking through 6 systems and moving fast because their understaffed same at the pharmacy. THEN ATTITUDES THEN COMPLAINT 
They speak in acronyms regarding cardiology. I learned from my pharmacy experience don't ask what acronyms mean. I literally made my own sheet at pharmacy.
I'm going to make this short. Orientation day one we met HR. However what we were not told was that because this is the largest hospital. There are HR Reps for each department. 
I shadow Anna the whole day Wednesday. I got a recording of receptionists saying thank god shes with Nina tomorrow ALL THE QUESTIONS 
Thursday I shadow nina who I got on recording complaining to her husband on the phone that she has someone shadowing her and she's young pretty and her dresses I know she's making more than me because of her degrees this is bull shit. I keep telling her to take a lunch. And all her fucking questions. Then on the recording I walk back in. I actually said I'm taking lunch at 1:30 you could tell she's talking in code ok bye bye honey. I could since the attitude from Nina and this is before I even heard the recording. On lunch I go to the chapel and cry for 30 minutes. I've never been in a chapel. I'm just Christian. But this hospital is super Catholic. Before lunch a woman walks in and looks like Chris jenne walks in finally a woman in this office who dresses like me. She says ""I hear someone talking to Nina and who are you? When did you start? She's like I handle payroll a slew of others things. I say oh well when can I clock in? She looks shocked left and Hands me time sheet. I said oh boss Kathy said she would."" Alina laughs to herself she says please please meet with me. I said when she said well tomorrow is Thursday I handle payroll. I said my last day is Friday and I'll permanently be at the other hospital"" In her thick accent she says last day Friday!"" I say to nina wow she so pretty her shoes her whole outfit. Nina ""yeah shes always in heals heels matching and furs"" I'm like its inspirational nina waves her hand ""meh""
So I meet Alina and she is the only person that has my back and is HR. She closes door. ""Look I made this for you. Forget everything HR told you on Monday packets everything. They can't expect you to learn this in 3 days. She says luckily for you your location is better I handle both. Come to me for HR before you go to main HR. She says you running late just let me know don't listen to that other hr. She said your young very pretty like my daughter whose 30. You hear something on the floor ignore it. You see how I dress no problem to keep up with yourself. You remind me of my 30 year old daughter. Kathy has given you no instructions contacts, etc. Between you and me I made this for you."" She hands me a packet acronyms,  md names nurses, tells me number, something kathy my boss should of handed to me. KATHY NEVER CLOCKED ME IN. Alina just got back from vacation Wednesday. 
I will succeed. I'm folding laundry. Listening to recordings making notes. I was going to go to the library to organize my notes listening to recordings. Kathy called Alina twice trying to find out what was taking so long. Alina says it will get done. Alina says give this form to Kathy. She needs to pay for your travel and send it to me. I said or she never mentioned that. Alina of course not
I know is Jesus got my back and because of HR/payroll and among other things. Alina seems likeva good heart. I will succeed I will move beyond this department. Quite frankly I'll likely retire from this hospital.

New psychiatrist,"I saw my new psychiatrist yesterday. My old one I've been seeing for 2 years is going to work with veterans and his practice stopped taking my insurance so I had to get a new therapist and pdoc. It's sad but I like the new one, she seemed nice. However, she wants me to get off my latuda. She doesn't seem to think it's doing anything for me since I'm still dealing with depression and latuda is for bipolar depression. She said I'm on such a low dose, I'm on 40 mg and it goes up to 120, but when I go any higher it makes me really jittery like I feel like I have restless leg syndrome. I'm very sensitive to antipsychotics so latuda is the only one I can take. she switched me to Prozac from Zoloft cuz Zoloft above 50 mg made me very anxious but I was on Prozac for many years and did fine. My old pdoc took me off of it after I went through a mixed episode cuz he said it could be activating. She also upped my lamictal from 200 mg at night to 150 2x a day and upped my buspar for anxiety. She thinks if she can up all those to a good dose I will be stable and not need latuda but I'm worried because the last time I got off latuda (a pdoc took me off of it because he seemed to think I had borderline personality disorder not bp2 and said cbt wwas working for me that meds aren't needed for that therapy works idk he was a quack) anyway, I got off it and was still on Prozac but wond up in the hospital for suicidal ideation. She thinks it's because i wasnt on a mood stabilizer but said lamictal doesn't help with depression it helps with manic episodes and I felt like that was conflicting I guess she's reffering to racing thoughts because she mentioned that lamictal will help with that idk. she said if latuda keeps me out of the hospital I can stay on it but she doesn't think I need to be on it that it's not doing anything so I decided to wait until I am put on the right dose of everthing else before I try to get off of it.

But now at 26 Im thinking maybe i didnt have the insight to notice i do qualify for some of those questions they asked me. And maybe that doctor that actually took the time to look at the psych ward was right.....Obviously its been very clear to me that I have depressive moodswings..but im struggling with figuring out if im also having high manic episodes..where im energetic almost feeling euphoric..feeling good about my decisions and wanting to be happy.

I almost wasn't able to go because my husband was having a flare up with his MS and asked me to stay home because he couldn't take care of our son but grandma was able to watch him.,bipolar-disorder

Super sleepy,"For the past week I have been getting super sleepy by 5pm. Like ready for bed. I'm gonna ask mom to give me my pills at seven. I'll take them then go to my room to read for an hour before I fall asleep. Lord knows what possessed me to pick up a new shift making me work five days in a row. It's only two hours each on Tuesday and Thursday but I think I'll try to make it Monday and Thursday so I can keep Tuesday's off.

confused - time is out of sync,"OK. This is going to sound very strange but I am utterly confused about the day and the time.
I woke up, hearing my neighbour's alarm (I hear it every morning) and thought he was up early. I knew it was Sunday morning. Then I heard conversation and I thought 'oh he has people in very early today'. I wondered where my pot of coffee was. Shrugged that off and I still had some helbal tea so I just had that. It was 7am (I was convinced) so I decided I would wait a couple of hours and then go to the nearest town to do some shopping.
On a couple of hours (no idea right now what i did during that time) and I checked the time on my phone and it was 9.49 and I thought I better get myself in gear before the day was over. Thought I'd make coffee and then leave. Then I looked at the computer which said 21.53 and even went into Control Panel to see why the time had gone wrong.
Went into the bathroom and it was very dark so I began to wonder. I went downstairs, the house feels like 'night time'. I made my coffe thinking 'did I lose Sunday? what the fck?""
Came back, checked my phones - both cell phones had Sat 14th and 10 ish. Checked the computer and it confirmed that it was after 22.00pm.
I had to call my son to ask him what day it is and if it is day or night.
I now know in my head that it is somehow saturday night, I don't think I had dinner and am now having coffee but my body feels uneasy and still convinced that it is Sunday even though all the evidence says otherwise.
I'm tempted to call a few other people to convince me of the actual time and day.
I feel anxious, nervous and not trusting myself. I feel like I have somehow stepped outside of time and space.

The worst gift ever!!,"In the spirit of Christmas, what is the worst gift you have ever received?

mine is this:
I am a Christian. My two younger sisters are not. My youngest sister Lynn for my birthday two years ago bought me a lovely cross necklace with a nativity stone inside which I live and get so many compliments on and a book of devotions. I thought it was very thoughtful. Then a year later she randomly surprised me with a gift of a wall decoration of the last supper. Ok. Not bad. Then a short time later she bought me yet another wall hanging of the last supper. I appreciate the thought but wow. She was being thoughtful but how many wall hangings of the last supper do I need?!

My friend,"My friend died early this morning.  I have been visiting her on a different floors at the same hospital I was in than when I was discharged I would visit daily. Last night I knew it wouldn't be long until she was gone. The good part was lots and lots of people were coming in and out it was like grand central station, the best part was it was nothing but laughter and love.  The reason why I'm writing this is there is a wonderful and important lesson for all of us. 
Let me tell you about her first...she grew up as a park ranger kid so her playground was the great outdoors. She was and stayed a very different type of person unfortunately a person everyone stared at. I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with SNL and the skit Pat (no clue if person was a man or a woman) well she was just like that....jeans, boots,plaid shirt, wallet in the back pocket and a beat up old explorer.  She was a genius and I'm saying that lightly ...she had so many PHD but you would never know.  She never slept she sound proof her house so she could work without disturbing her neighbors. She retired early and spent her time giving to people and when she was done at the end of the day she would give more.  She had a house full of sick dogs and took care of them and than gave them to people who were alone.  She than had her dogs that were search and rescue dogs so she was always out there doing that. In the morning she would pick up food from restaurants and grocery stores and give it out to homeless people. Lots of food banks ar enclosed on the weekend( I guess you don't get hungry on the weekend) so she would make sure they had food to last the weekend. I remember last year this woman with this tiny baby was in tears because they didn't have a formula that her baby didn't react from So she told this mom to meet her in the morning and she would have the formula she needed. So make long story short she would meet this woman to give her formula every weekend for her baby along with tons of everything else.  The other thing which was unbelievable was she would have surgeries with very very little knock out meds so much so she could hold a conversation. I took her home after having a double mastectomy and she was wide awake. She practically had to sign her right to be alive with the legal side of it but she would sign what needed to be signed and went off to surgery. She went to same hospital and she had same Dr work on her so she those Dr knew her well unfortunately she was not blessed with a good working body but you would never know. I guess there was nothing that she wouldn't and couldnt do.  A house burned down she built them a new one. Like I said there was nothing she couldn't and wouldn't do. 
So in the end of day the world lost a gem this morning and heaven just got an angel that they never will forget because she sure made her mark on this world. What a life knowing every person you met where so much better for having you in there life. What a gift and I'm just thankful that I was her friend. I will miss her so so much. Thanks if you are reading this post.  I guess just don't judge people from the cover... well we shouldn't and don't have the right to judge anyone because of the way they look or the way they live there life.

Abandonment,"Last week, my veterinarian accused me of things that were not true and wanted to end the relationship I had worked hard to build up for the sake of my cat.
This week, already early on this week, I discovered that someone broke into my home, broke the lock and stole most of the food I had. Now, that may not seem like a big thing, as the things one would think about thefting didn't happen. As a result I contacted the police who made a report, but the community where I live caught wind of this and I am being riduculed for over reacting, more bullying. Property management did nothing to fix my broken front door lock today and they are closed now.  I live on a very limited budget and this is a financial hardship for me to buy the foods I lost. Not to mention the fear of living behind a broken door and fear they may be back.  This is supposed to be a locked building and yet, since this summer the basement door has been found unlocked numerous times.  Management does nothing but turns a blind eye. 
Then today, my new therapist (have met with her only last two months) decided to push me off until January.  I reflected back and discovered that many times she would suddenly change her schedule to put me off another week at the last minute for family needs. Then she didn't want to meet with me this week as I am recovering from a sinus infection and she didn't want to carry my germs to some of her elderly clients.  Well, she has school age children that carry more virulent viruses than I, even going to the grocery store and handling a cart can transfer lots of germs, so why am I being used as an excuse?  She also decided to go to a 3 day seminar (canceled another appt) and now has to go to take care of a family member (canceled another appt).  So, I wrote her an email in response to her canceling all my appts until mid January and let her know that I will not be continuing with her.  I realized that all this disruption in my treatment schedule is hard for me adjusting to a new dx of BiPolar ll along with new meds too.  So, I am once again, looking for a new therapist.
Along with not fitting in where I live, being shunned and not accepted here, I have to seriously wonder what's wrong with me. ",bipolar-disorder
A surprise gift for my aunt!,"Remeber the fox hat I posted for my nephew? My aunt saw it and asked if I could make her a koala hat. I had to buy the pattern, but I love how it turned out! I cant wait to gift it to her for Christmas!",bipolar-disorder
My neighbors the pyramanics,"The neighbor who ajoins the wall with me constantly sets off fires in the kitchen.  They put on something to cook on the stove and then leave to let the kitchen catch fire.  This has been going on for the past 2 years and management has done nothing about it.
On the other side of me is the main pipe for gas.
Each time they have a fire, I am the only one on the floor and of course I see and hear the alarm.  Every time I call for help, I get crucified by being a drama queen and over reacting by calling 911 for help to put out the fire. 
So, today, on goes the smoke detector and it goes on and on and on and never goes off.  I walk out into the hallway and see black smoke coming out under the front door.  So, instead of calling 911 this time I run to the managers office and found no one there.  Then grabbed a neighbor who found them and I sent her to tell them.  I will be smelling smoke for days now in my home and I have asthma.
Yesterday I saw on their exterior shelt a lit candle, so it has got me wondering if these are truly pyromanics living beside me.
In any event, I wrote an email to property management asking for the correct protocol when this happens.  Now I know to call 911, but in this community one just does not call 911.  Oh and the last time I went in to help maintenance put out the fire, i was told by property maintenance that I could be evicted by trespassing.  So, this is the hard line I deal with where I live. 
So, fire is very triggering for me, so heading up the Hypomanic trail tonight.  Called my psych doc and she increased my Zyprexa, so hoping this helps.............. some.  Usually the night after a fire I am too afraid to sleep, so will just curl up on my recliner and try to rock myself a bit.

cervical radiculopathy - yay me!,"finallly an answer, not a particularly good one but an answer all the same to some of the questions. PT said that because it has gone on for so long untreated that my only option is surgery. I have to allow this to sink in. She accessed the results of my MRI which doc probably had when I saw him last Friday but he never thought to mention because hey, I was there for recurring mouth ulcers/blisters to do with the still unknown auto immune disease that they suspect. Heaven forbid that he may have to think of two things at once.
She (the PT) was stunned at my lack of treatment but she did say, as I have always said that because I look very healthy, do a lot of exercise, am always in good form, and all they saw was a fifteen year old diagnosis of Fibro and dismissed all other symptoms.
She said that the weakness of my left leg indicated that there is probably a trapped nerve in the lumbar spine also. let them all join the party.
In many ways it was a huge relief to have somebody ask me 'does the extreme pain in your arm/hands wake you up?' Hell yes.
She was astonished that i am as mobile as i am given the crap state of my spine, hips and knees (thanks to my mother's genetics) which I have been telling the medics about for years.
Luckily thanks to my daily exercise routine I have retained much movement that I would have otherwise have lost had i a sedentary lifestyle (thank you, my love of swimming and walking and my morning stretches outside my kitchen window!)
She was so much more pleasant than the last time I went there much to my relief and her kindness was an absolute balm.
Fibromyalgia was an incorrect diagnosis which she described as a 'lazy one' as they did not order an MRI fifteen yrs ago or blood work or anything else (even a simple balance test) which could have given me more time before or even if surgery became necessary.
Yes, I am angry. Yes, I am upset. But I am so relieved to no longer be dismissed as yet another BP person with issues caused by PTSD or anxiety or stress or whatever they might have decided. (probably genetics combined with all the heavy lifting my father made me do when I was way to young to do it).
The exercises she suggested I have actually been doing for years apart from one called 'flossing' which exercises the legs and the neck at the same time and can be done while sitting down. I have always exercised my ankles/feet so now I just have to add in neck exercises too.
I am also happy that she emphatically stressed 'you are far too young to have to use a cane, this should never have happened' but added 'don't tell your gp I said that, most docs think they are gods!' lol
what a joy to meet an actual human being. I see her again on Jan 7th.
Today I made an arrangement to call the office manager of another GP practice and arranged to call a different GP in the morning for an appointment. Fortunately she told me I had to try and change GP's before Jan as once the local guy leaves they will freeze medical card patients and I will be unable to move until they appoint a new one for my locale.
I only hope that I can find the 'change GP' form that the dept sent me ages ago so that the doc I hope to see tomorrow or thursday will take me on. He is wonderful so fingers crossed. My second choice is the practice that I have to call the office manager about.
SO. Please wish me luck in my quest to get away from the one across the street. The extra drive would be absolutely worth it.
Too much to take in.
Funny Ha Ha, she also said 'you need to see an orthopaedic surgeon' and we both laughed when I told her I saw one who didn't bother doing anything, saw I had BP and he said 'You need to see a rheumatologist' and sent me home.
Can't wait to see him again!

hell on earth,"  This case management company I believe is doing crooked things to me.  My case manager who is a young man has just about tried everything to ruin my life.  I'm getting 35 bucks a week to live off of.  I even caught this lady from the payeeship where I get my weekly check.  This other case manager had to call her to retrieve some information about me and when she mentioned my name I heard her say sarcastically, ""Was he a happy camper?""  She didn't know I was with my case manager, I was sitting right across from her at my own kitchen table and I heard her through the handset of the phone.  I let it slide.  So I told this case manager about it at Compass and I know it got back to her.  So I get this young kid that I told this to as a case manager and he told me it was up to the lady I caught talking about me how much I get a week for spending.  They never did this before and I've been with the company for about twelve years now.  Then I lost my internet even my lan line phone and I am so poor there are times I can't afford to use my cell phone.  They asked me a couple of times if I had a lawyer, and that made me very nervous.  Then I ended up in the E.R. a couple of times and they found out about it.  I know for sure I never told them cause I knew they would get off on it , and they did.  Scott leaned forward and gave me a nasty stare and said, ""We know you where in the E.R. we found out.  And then the job coach leaned forward and with a big smile on her face said,""Lets talk about when you where in the emergency room...How did you feel then?""  I've been eating at the soup kitchen.  Sometimes Scott says over the phone,""So how are doing ...how are you feeling?""  It ticks me off because it's a threatening metaphor and I can't prove it's bad.  They are in direct communication with all my doctors.. and I have about 4 of them.  The new psychiatist they gave me is only filling 3 of my psychiatrict medications and I'm on 6.  One time when I was talking to the VR Coordinator and I smarted off, ""Yeah, I'm at the mercy of his medication""  and she said,""Yes you are.""  The other case manager I had before Scott tried to make me homeless.  She looked at me and smiled,""Y'our not gonna make the rent this month John..and you don't even have enough money to move.  So I got another case manager and when we went in the computer we found the problem.  I was paying two cable bills.  I terminated AT&T but they were still billing me.  If she knew I wasn't going to make the rent she probably knew why.  Thank God she retired .  Now I got this Scott kid.  He just happened to be at a few sites when I was there.  When I was at the payeeship he leaned forward and sarcastically said, ""Hi John.  Then he just happened to be in the parking lot of Compass when I was out there too. So I glared up at him and said,""What are you guys doing out here?""  He said he was taking a patient somewhere.  I said it again and it looked like he got real scared.  Then him and Melinda said they wanted me to meet them at social security.  This was the same lady I caught talking about me and who lowered my rent from 50 bucks to 39 bucks.",bipolar-disorder

As always I am very happy to have a roof over my head in a nice quiet spot in a small village with oil heating installed as I can no longer lift solid fuel for the range.
The plumber is to come today or tomorrow to disconnect the range in my kitchen which I can no longer use as I am unable to lift the fuel needed. It will give me wonderful extra space in my kitchen, perhaps to put in two small comfy armchairs and i can finally get it painted so am very much looking forward to that.
I just had a delicious bowl of oatmeal with blueberries, honey and orange pieces which was yummy and am enjoying a huge mug of hot tea.
I am so pleased with all the progress this week with clearing my house, filling bags for charity with the encouragement of ML for which I am extremely grateful.
it is pelting down sleet and snow outside just now and increased gratitude for being inside in the warmth. I often worry about Heritic at this time, she has been absent for some time now and her wit was always an added boon to our days.

"Life, and DBT","Recently I started working again, after nearly 9 years unemployed (disability).  I also have physical therapy due to an injury, and since I don't drive, I have to take the bus to work and dr's.

All this adds up to about 8 hours a day away from home, 4 days a week, plus extra trips for shopping or regular Dr appts.

This is where DBT comes in handy - training me to more often be in the Moment - because I am naturally a worrier, an overthinker, and I can spend all morning ""thinking"" ahead about work that afternoon, instead of truly being in the Morning and making use of the time I have at home.

I've quit a lot of jobs in my past because I got too stressed out, but I know a lot of it came from extra worrying that I did at Home, instead of just leaving work at Work.  

DBT teaches about letting thoughts pass on by, and I haven't mastered it yet but I'm at least Seeing the negative patterns as they try to come back, and I'm fighting to develop a New pattern of being more in the moment.

Women’s Health and Mental Health,"I'm dealing with some things and thought I'd open this up for discussion and shared experiences.  I think I've brought this up before.  The complexities of how these two medical areas are intertwined but I don't feel like it's openly discussed, or intelligently I should say.  You know, jokes about being ""hormonal"" and ""waaaah you must be on your period"".... that sort of thing.  I don't want to open this up to masculine machismo stuff versus female hormonal stuff but wanted to hear from others on the realities of this.... pregnancy and postpartum depression and perimenopause and post menopause and infertility issues and female cancers, etc.
ive dealt with some frustrating things up here into until now my 40s.  Depression diagnosis in college, hypothyroidism in college, bipolar diagnosis in mid 20s, pregnancy at 30, pregnancy loss at 30,  depression through 30s, estrogen-positive breast cancer later in 30s and now in my early 40s dealing with more careful gynecological cancer watches in progress with hysterectomy soon. I'm tired, and depression is taking over, but at the same time know that there are other shared journeys out there who know these difficulties.  
Because of my medical history with bipolar in the mix of all this I am finding this all very anxiety provoking bc so much of my bipolar management has been focused on managing my sleep.  All I seem to focus on is making sure I sleep each night to get through the next day. The journey our female bodies endure is no joke or laughing matter but I don't feel like it's openly discussed so thought I'd see how others are feeling.

A Party Without Ativan,Today was my youngest nephew's birthday party at a local park. It was tight quarters in the building my sister rented and lots of children running amuck which ticked me off. Don't let your children run around inside a cramped building going under tables and chairs. Not cool. But I didn't take any Ativan which I usually do at get togethers. I managed well. It was a fun time. And everyone loves the hat I made :),bipolar-disorder
Safety information from Nov. 13,"I feel that this is information for all survivors of domestic violence in this or any group.
'Everything you went thru is just, remarkable. Now you have gained the ranks of a survivor and now onto thriving. This is all coming from one who went thru something very similar to what you are going thru. YOU MADE IT !! Doing the happy happy dance for YOU and throwing confetti all over your new home *smiles*. Welcome to your new life !!!  Did you by chance go to the post office to get a ""secret post office box"" yet? What can happen for the first 5 years, is that any mail sent to you from your spouse can be returned right back to him with your new address on it. As long as he writes ""Return address requested"" on the front of the envelope, the Post Office is obligated to return it to him along with your new address. Your change of address will remain secret if you open this ""secret post office box"". I know it's inconvenient to go to the post office to get your mail, but this one step will help keep you safer. Here are a few links that may help you: https://victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/past-programs/stalking-resource-center/help-for-victims/address-confidentiality-programs  Also, call your local domestic violence women's shelter to see if they can refer you to a domestic violence counselor. You have done all the hard work for now, so try to polish it off and a DV counselor will know just how to counsel you. Once you are under the wing of a DV counselor or even attend the shelter for support groups, that in of itself will open alot more doors for you.  Remember that you are expending alot of energy right now, so it's time to pamper yourself. I found right after I moved, I would gather myself up on my bed, spread a quilt over me and my cat would join me and kneed the quilt and I would slip away into a wonderful nap. I took long walks in nature as nature can be soo very healing. Do you have a balcony? I did alot of gardening on my balcony.  Also, did you change the license plates on your car too?Your address with the division of motor vehicles can be that secret post office, same with your tax returns.  If you plan to vote, your new address or even former address is open to the public. Your spouse could request your address. So, be sure to notify your election prescient to ask for a non-disclosed address.  I put a secret question on all my bank accounts and anything else that my spouse may be able to access, such as new utilities, phone, etc. And do a third party verification on all bank accounts, etc where to open the account online it has to go to either your cell (which I recommend) or an email account.  Be sure to vary your route to work and be aware if anyone is following you. When you put your car into park, before you get out of your car, sit for a few moments and look around for any signs of your spouse or anything out of the ordinary, and remember to trust your gut instincts. Wait for a group of people walking in and try to join, remember safety in numbers. Getting in and out of a car can leave one vulnerable. Do you carry Mace on your key chain? Once out of the car, stand by your door, with it partially open and look around again and walk swiftly to the front door of your building. Upon leaving work, before you step off the curb into the parking lot, pause and look around. As you are approaching your car try to look underneath your car, behind the wheels of your car for any nails strategically positioned, or any changes to your car. I had to have the locks on my car changed. I came out to my car one day and found all the doors of my car open and lots of damage to my engine.  My spouse sent in joint tax returns and did not sign my name to the form. He was hoping the IRS would return the form to him with my new address. The only way I knew this was that I had contacted the IRS to notify them that Ihad separated and would be filing Separate but Married. The IRS send me the return my spouse filled out to verify if this was true and fact. Here is a link to read from the IRS for help with filing under your situation: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayers-who-are-victims-of-domestic-abuse-should-know-their-rights  Do you have a Separation Agreement done now? Do you have a lawyer? The Domestic Violence Women's Shelter should have their own attorney free of charge for anything you need while you resid there or are attending DV support groups.  Is your front door visible from the street? There are several free security devices that can record who comes to your front door. I think one is called Ring. There are several on the market you can look into.  Put a freeze on the three repositories (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion). Once that is done, request a copy of your credit report, not the one what gives you a scoring, but one that you need just to see if anyone has opened an account. I would check this randomly.  There is alot more information I could give you but don't want to overwhelm you. Also, be sure that your phone number is unlisted. I eventually changed my last name too. Keep writing and let us know how your new day goes for you at work. Keep on keeping on !!",bipolar-disorder

Are your childless?,"Yesterday was like the worst day ever. I finally decided to donate or sale what I can of my baby wish box. I knew deep down I wasn't ever getting pregnant despite everything working right. I had a gut feeling when I was 21. Anywho, I bravely dontated diapers, onesies other stuff I bought I'm too embarrassed to admit I bought that I'm donating and selling.  So those of you MEN and WOMEN who are childless. Please tell me your age if you choose. Why didn't you have kids? Was it by choice? Do you regret it? Did you adopt? Did you pay for an embryo? Did you try IUI or IVF? Did you not do any infertility treatment. Do you have too me niece's and nephews? DID YOU CHOOSE TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE OF BIPOLAR DISORDER ALONE?
I'll start I'm 34 all my lady parts are working great but they just couldn't figure out why I couldn't get pregnant. Since I'll  be 35 next fall I'll enter the death zone of fertility world for women. Basically its over for me. I'm barren spinster. 
Now if your reading this and you have kids. How is it being a bipolar mom or dad? HOW WAS IT BEING A PREGNANT bipolar woman? How did meds effect the baby?

Conflict with my veterinarian,"Because I disagreed with my veterinarian's best practices, I am leaving this clinic and here's part with the problem.
In my state, and I think I may have brought this up earlier in another thread, my veterinarian can access all my prescription drugs without my permission and knowledge as it's part of the Opiod Monitoring in my state. Some states have adopted this law, my state is one of them. I just verified this with my pharmacy.
In a conversation last week with the practice manager, she said to me that the vets at this practice no longer trust what I have to say, nor do they believe what I report about my cat's behaviors, (shocking !!) even though I gave them a copy of a pet behaviorists report along with videos of his behaviors.    I think it was the wording that they ""did not believe me"" that struck a very negative chord with me, but before I go into that, I wanted to explore what my next steps should be.
Because I am on an anti-psychotic and other controlled substances and my vet practice now knows all my medications prescribed to me and the name of my prescribing doctors, I am wondering if that would be the basis of their judgement of me (not believing me because they did not see the behaviors in clinic). My vet practice did call in and cancel all refills, as verified by my pharmacist, but that was a month before all this discovery happened (do they think I am a pill seaker?).  Updated this thread to add the ""Pill Seaker"" reaction.
This is a scary time for me as I am facing giving up on my pet or stopping all my behavioral medications.  I am frightened that now they know I am on all these medications, could they report me to animal control and take away my cat showing animal control my prescription history as a unfit owner, solely on my medication history ?  I would think the only grounds would be that I am on antipsychotics.  I have always had a neighbor in the room with me every single timeI brought my cat in for any exam. Now I am extremely paranoid and upset.
So, it comes down to the fact, my veterinarian has the legal right in my state to obtain all this sensitive information without my knowledge or written permission.  How I react to this is scaring me.  Thank you for reading this. ",bipolar-disorder

Super Depressed,"
I am feeling super depressed. I want to feel better so I am here to share. 
 
Lately life has been tough for me. My life has never been easy, but lately it has been extra hard. Due to a family tragedy, four of my nieces and nephews ended up in foster care (2 boys, 2 girls). I live in my mother's house; my younger sister also lives here. My mother, me and my sister signed up to be foster parents. I didn’t want to. I can barely take care of myself, let alone four kids with trauma and various emotional issues. But I didn’t have a choice, none of us did, it was either become foster parents or let the kids rot in foster care, because there was no other family members with the room to take them in, or quite frankly the desire to, and we didn’t want them split up after the trauma they already faced.
 
They have been here since April 2019. Things are better than it was when they first got here, but things aren’t good. They don’t listen, they run amuck, they are always fighting and arguing, at night I cant sleep because someone is crying from a bad dream, they are super needy. Every morning I am woken out of my sleep because the kids are fighting, arguing, and refusing to listen as my mother is trying to get them ready for school.
 
Add into this is the fact that I just returned to college. The last time I was in college was 10 years ago. I work as a peer specialist which is a fucking stressful, draining job. All of this is going on at once. I am just overwhelmed. I didn’t go to school today; I’m trying to muster up the energy to finish this semester on a good foot. I am one second from fucking walking away. It would be stupid to. The last day of college is on December 12. Then its finals week from the 13th to the 20th. Then I’m fucking done until next semester. 
 
I feel like a failure. I feel like I don’t help enough with the kids, I feel like I miss too many days of school. I feel like I miss too many days of work. I feel like I go to work late too often. I am obese and I am broke and sometimes I feel ugly and completely unattractive, and I am 30 years old and I live with my mother. I feel like a shitty aunt I don’t spend enough time with the kids I yell at them when they frustrate me and sometimes, I spank them when they don’t listen when I know I shouldn’t. I feel like scum. My issues have issues and I just want to be left the fuck alone. Some days I hate my life. Some days I hate myself. Some days I’ve had enough and I just want to give up. They say that god would never give you any struggle that you can’t handle, well something must be lost in translation because this feels overwhelming, I am not strong enough to handle it.

Do you have a bad temper?,"I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder in April. The diagnosis seemed to fit at first. I have unstable relationships until a couple years ago. I've done a lot of work in therapy and with God and have let go of most of the anger I used to feel. mine of the criteria for bpd is
Inappropriate, intense ange  controlling anger (eg, frequent displays of temper, constant anger, or recurrent physical fights)

i asked my therapist today if she thinks I for the criteria. She asked why and I told her I am incredibly even tempered. She actually said I am ""too"" even tempered. She said rather than telling people when I was angry, I internalize it which I do. she doesn't like the bpd diagnosis in general but said I appear somewhere on the spectrum.

My step family,"Hello all, I'm new. Just would love to get some feedback on my situation.

my mother is a recovering alcoholic with borderline personality disorder and my father died of terminal illness four years ago. 
three and a half years ago she got sober and while I was away at school she moved a man who is a recovering heroin addict and his two young chidren into our house, I never new these people prior to that.


i am home for the holidays on a three month break in my studies and I am living in my old house again. 
I am so devastated seeing how she treats this man and his children so much better than she treated my brother and I growing up. Her and this man never married so the situation is really ambiguous but his daughter considers me and my mom her family which only adds confusion to the situation because I don't reciprocate. Her 'partner' has a very bitter ex wife that hasn't gotten over the divorce and tries to get the kids in the middle of it, my mom is the last priority. Even though she treated me bad it upsets me to see this guy treat her with complete apathy when my father was so good to her. I didn't come home for almost three years and then when I got back on track with school i started leaning more on my family and couldn't afford to stay anywhere else. I want to remain focused on my end goal and graduate in 2021 but I don't think I can take any more of this and want to just leave the house today and never see these people again. She is paying for my school and I've already asked her it I can stay with a friend for the rest of the break but because of my bipolar she ""doesn't trust that"" and said she will cut off my studies if I leave.
in the time I was away from home ironically all of my mood symptoms went away and in the past few weeks since being back, they are back again. 

i am going through an online course from home and haven't been able to focus on my studies since I've been here. So I know a new environment would help me to study for the final exam. Am I trying to run away or is this emotionally abusive past triggering me?

how is it that I am being asked to share something with this other mans children that I never had growing up? ",bipolar-disorder

6am and woke up again after a short time, in a lot of pain. V. tired of 'helpful' suggestions from people in my life giving me sleep remedies.
The MRI was uneventful and quite peaceful. At least this time they remembered to leave the damn music off so I didn't have to press the bell to remind them which seemed to irritate them before even though I had asked them to turn it off as it makes me nauseous.
Misconstrual drives me nuts. People now say to me 'oh you don't like music, tv, radio etc.' I endlessly have to reply 'I love music and some tv but now it actually makes me dizzy and ill, wish it didn't.'  At least in recent months I have been getting some renewed pleasure in music as I found that if I listen to it on my laptop with the volume barely on, I can tolerate and enjoy it for a while.

I came unglued and felt, and still do feel lost in the jungle of life. I'm trying to find my way through the forest to find some light at the end of the tunnel. So many times for so many years, each time going down into the worm hole makes my ability to climb out seem beyond the energy or desire needed to breathe in the oxygen of life. 
I think I feel guilt and shame around not doing what I know I can do, those feelings are the basis of my depressive and negative self talk. Some have said stop being so hard on yourself, well maybe I need to be a bit softer, but not a marshmellow. Marshmellows are yummy, but we all know where they end up....mushy, in flames, or golden brown, more times than not, eat too many and get sick. Below is a way for me to make a start. What I write is what I will do as I don't want to lie or to havel somewho who might read think I'm a go getter. I'll be starting my day in the morning and if It Takes All Day and Into The Night, my three goals for tomorrow will be completed.

Strong feelings,"I don't have too many strong feelings now...for the most part, the zyprexa takes them away and makes me reasonably flat.

However, before that, I tended to allow my feelings to wash over me...I was not one that wanted to numb myself from feelings.

I can't imagine a world without feelings, both happy and sad.  Grief, loss, suffering...joy, as well.  For some reason, I never wanted to turn to alcohol or drugs, etc to keep me from feeling strong emotions.

That doesn't make me a better person than anyone else.   I do wish I could Give myself to others, my ability to tolerate strong feelings, even the painful ones.

The holidays are here, and for some, it's a time of intense suffering.   I say a prayer nowadays for those who are in pain, that God could take from me, and give to them, so they might be able to make it through.

Peer Pressure at 28,"I think that's what you would call this. Back in the summer my pastor spoke to me about getting involved in the church. She asked me to help out in the cafe one sunday a month.

Then my pastor approached me again to ask me to also volunteer one sunday a month at the welcome center. I agreed.

She said how desparate they are and I am the only one she has asked because she really wants me. I told her I would think about it and pray about it but the more I do so, the less I want to do it.

Need Advice,"My boyfriend of 2 years has bipolar depression. He was very open to me about it from the beginning of our relationship and tried his best to warn me of certain signs of stages that he goes through.

I will never be able to completely understand but i always try my best to be there for him even when i don't understand why he feels what he does. At first he communicated very well and always warned me before he got super down so i would know to expect some changes in the way he acts and feels towards me. Lately, he has been very distant and pushing me away. He barely talks to me anymore to the point where i can't even be there for him anymore. On top of this, we have a long distance relationship.

Right now, he thinks i don't love him and won't answer me, talk to me, or tell me how he feels. i don't know how to deal with it or what to do because i don't want him to feel like i'm better with out him. he's left me before out of guilt for not wanting to put me through hard times and thinks i deserve better. right now it feels mine our relationship is one-sided and that he puts in no effort but i know it only feels like that right now because of what he has no control over. i'm never going to give up on him, i'm still learning how to deal with it myself just like he is. just need some advice on how to approach this situation. i feel like if i give him space then he will feel like i don't care or love him. but if i keep pushing him to communicate and talk to me he will see i'm stressed and hurting and leave me because he thinks it's his fault and i'm better with out him. ",bipolar-disorder

P.O. Box is it worth it?,"So how does a P.O. Box work. Does it make you un-findable? Is it worth the rent a month on a tight budget. I'm already paying 900 rent for a one bedroom and thats cheap for Chicago suburbs. Most one bedrooms are 1100-1200. It seems in inconvenient having to pay plus pick up mail. I order stuff on amazon all the time. It's going to be at least close to a year before he can google me and find my address. I have no social media. I'm not into Facebook, Twitter, yada yada... Before I left I checked his phone. He doesn't have my email. Should I change my emails? I'm about to get the samsung 10 and change my phone number. I shamefully admit its hard because he'll have no way to contact me. He did write me 22 page letter and address it to his place so that it was forwarded to my new apartment. He hasn't contacted me since 11/7 asking if I need my windshield fluid filled because he knows I'm uber uber girly. He removed me from Costco membership. Luckily, the lady let me buy my stuff. I have my 9th session with my thearpist. I used 7 sessions with the first EAP (Employee Assistance Program 100% free through my job) As you know during my 7th session I found other thearpist to be rude. So I switched to another. I've met with her twice and explained I'm here to vent and let this out about domestic violence. It's healthier to talk to a professional plus I don't have friends. So Monday is my 3rd session with the new thearpist total of 9 free sessions so far. My last day at work is 12/6. I told my therapist so we can try to get the remaining 3 sessions in before my last day. So luckily at my job they have it set up where the insurance starts over every June. So I made all appointments with every doctor. From eye doctor to pdoc etc. So my benefits at the hospital kick in February. Oddest thing happened too my ex-coworker that helped me move who I speak to once a year is showing signs of jealousy that I got this job. I totally don't get it. I work at the largest pharmacy in the US and the job sucks! She wasn't  trippin I worked at the pharmacy. We haven't worked togther since 2012 she works with autistc kids a mental kids in their teens early 20s. And now that I'm at the largest hospital in Illinois why would she be jealous? My bad for the tangent. Anywho, do you guys think I should get a P.O. Box? My other question is. With black Friday coming up should I finance a loveseat, dresser and nightstand. If I do I'll have all my furniture? Does a P.O. Box make you untraceable?",bipolar-disorder

Feeling suicidal,"I hate to admit it. But I feel so depressed. I'm grieving the illusion of relationship. He sold me a dream. Numerous times he told me to fuck off and die. I flirted with suicide many times in that relatioship. I feel alone I'm not sure what my purpose in life is. I'm accepting my infertility. But whats the point in living. I have nothing here. At 34 its been this way since age 18. I'm not into meetup.com I'm not into church after leaving jehovah witnesses. I'm not a people person. People don't like me,. Estranged from my family. I've stayed strong to break a generational trend of incest in that family. I am strong for walking away from them. I won't adopt. I won't pay for an embryo. This is the loneliest I've ever felt in my life. I feel scared I'll never carry a human. I'm not a real woman. I have nothing. My hope is Jesus. My Strength is Jehovah. I just wish the lord would take me out. Its really pointless for me. I'm tired emotionally rundown. I'm trying to keep fighting but this sucks. I'm going to die an old lady with CNAs finding me.

Oncologist Appt yesterday,"Went to my yearly oncology appt.  I am now 7 years cancer free, yay !! Everytime I have to do anything with the subject of oncology or mammogram, I go into panic mode.  I shake, have rubbery legs and teeth chatter.  As the exam concludes, I don't want to leave, I always ask for a PETScan to rule out due to my type of cancer, but the answer is always no. Then I start to cry.  I have been going thru this everytime over the past 6 years. But this time was different, I remained calm and showed no outward emotion, however inside was very telling.....my bp was 180/90. I think the Lamictal and Zyprexa is helping immensely.
Anyway, when I first arrived at the appt, I came thru the small door (building was built back in the 60's and not handicapped accessible) had alot of trouble getting thru the front door of the building as my Rollator kept getting stuck at the door jam. Then getting into the doctors office, same thing. No one would get up to help me. Eventually got in.  The room was full of patients. So, after I signed in there were two chairs available but each chair had either a coat resting on it or a briefcase. Neither occupant would remove their items so I could sit down, so I stood in the middle of the room waiting for me to be called in. The nurse came up to give me paperwork to fill in (really?  I have been going there for 7 years). Pulled the seat down on my Rollator (seat is very tiny) and tried to sit on that, but all my paperwork kept falling out of my hands as I was balancing everything (purse, water, etc) on my lap.  But still no one would remove their items to let me sit down.  I tell you, I had to count to 10 over and over and over and kept biting my tongue to not say anything.  Before Lamictal, I would have addressed the need to sit down or even picked up the items and put them back in the lap of the owner (if those were theirs), but I am seeing that I can control my temper and insert safe thoughts now, so that is a big improvement for me. 
As I was leaving, again same thing going thru the doctors office door.  I visited the ladiesroom and there was a line to get into the toilets.  I was the only one standing there with my rollator so I had to wait for the larger stall.  People came and went with no apparent disability into the larger stall because they were next in line, so I had a long wait.  Leaving I had, once again, difficulty getting thru the front door of the building due to my Rollator.  A person was standing beside the door maybe waiting for someone, and never offered any help.  I felt the urge to say something to that person as I struggled thru the door, almost falling but succeeded in keeping my mouth shut.
Long and short, my oncologist said she will see me next Thanksgiving and I asked if I could see her in 6 months instead.  She said it's not medically necessary.  Then she said that my visits will be all done by year 10.  I asked if I could continue to see her and she said if only medically necessary or if something shows up on the yearly tests. She said that by the 10th year I will no longer need a Mammogram which panicked me. Sigh.............. My oncologists became my safety blanke, the tests reassured me that I am cancer free and I never want to move on from their protection,nor the yearly tests. They are an essential of my treatment journey and how will I identify myself once I am thru with their exams and tests at year 10.  It shocked me to hear I may be released from their care.  This is soo hard to think about.  
Last night I had the usual cancer dreams all night long and so I climbed into my recliner with my weighted blanket and rocked myself trying to self soothe. I have come a long way in those 7 years and things that happened to me I stuffed way down in my mind.  Trying to rap my head around everything cancer is huge for me as I think back what happened to me at first year.  I had no one to help me thru it all, I was totally all alone and had to figure out how to navigate all the tests, surgeries, radiation and aftercare, transportation, etc.  Looking back from year 7, I wonder how in the world I made it thru all that.  After 7 long years, I am slowly able to realize the enormity of what I went thru as it has been too hugh to look at any of it at all.  I never got any behavioral therapy while going thru this nor after, so it stands to reason why I numb out and go into panic mode.
Maybe I will slide into a Hypomanic state today, and maybe I won't, but will be ready for it if it comes. I'll just spend time in my recliner with my weighted blanket and try to get my mind off of everything cancer.
Thank you for listening.

life as it is right about now,"it is the same as it has been all of my life

The Worm Hole,"I've been in my own worm hole for over a year now, and I'm beyond fearing my medical condition vs. mental health meds. I just can't live my life day after day with breathing tears.
Weird how when I wrote out last night how I felt, and how angry I am and sick and tired of a no purpose life...today I began to have little, what I call God Whispers...no offense to those who have different Higher Powers. 
Today I decided to do one thing that I've not been doing on a consistant basic cause I don't have to...get dressed...at this point I'm not even baby stepping, Im crawling....and hoping to find some light. I see my therapist on Wed and at the end of the month my med aprn and hoping for ? to jump start me...hoping the basic of getting dressed every day will help.",bipolar-disorder
it's all been a bit of a to do.....,"long story short - I've been feeling unwell for several months. Looking at my mood charts I realised that things had been gradually getting worse year on year - several months of depression in the spring, several moths of agitation / nasty hypomania in the later summer / autumn.
So getting fed up with treating myself with seroquel prn I arranged to see my psychiatrist, first time in years.
I made notes - basically a script that I read - and somehow he missed some of the most important aspects, gave me a treatment for anxiety (pregablin) and sent me on my way. He then sent a letter to my doctor with alot of errors, suggesting I reduce my seroquel and a bunch of stuff that is totally irrelevent.
So I emailed him and suddenly he realises he missed the main point, says it's clear my meds aren't controlling my bipolar (ie it wasn't anxiety on top of the bipolar, it was really the bipolar, which I already knew). Suggests upping my meds, adding lithium (which I don't want to do, been there, done that)
He's copied the email to my GP. I've replied and I think we now have a plan but I don't think that's been copied to her. God knows what she's going make of it. I see her on Thursday.
I had sufficient of my main med, lamotrigine, to increase the dosage by a small amount. Weirdly I'm going through the side effects I went through when I first took it, plus a few extras. I don't remember having these problems when I upped my meds by a similar amount 3 years ago and proportionally this is a smaller increase.
oh well, all part of the fun of being bipolar.

Walked!!!,"Rizen in PTSD room has a post about walking everyday, I'll be posting there too...company would be Great!!
I had a dream/wake/sleep last night from midnight to 5am being awake....about going to a store and buying a coat with a hood and walk on the beach. Today I went and found that coat that I Love the color, sort of silver purple brush, that comes just below my hips, and has a wonderful warm fuzzy inside the detachable hood...good price too :) About a month ago I bought some new sneakers....they have been waiting :(
I walked for the first time today outside around the blocks where I live....7th's of a mile...felt some nephropathy in my foot from long ago back surgery, but I'd been on my feet walking around a grocery store for about an hour...enjoyed some 60's music :) to increase speed a bit and make more fun.
Me ole body is getting giggly and wiggly :) mental/ kidney health, exercise will help with removing toxins.

Having a Rough Day,"Hey! So I am just having a terrible day. I think that I am coming down from a mania and I am just so depressed. 
I found out that the way classes are scheduled I won't graduate from my program until 2024. I was absolutely devastated... I can't imagine being 32 and just out of college. There is so much shame and anger I have wrapped up with my education I can't imagine being here for four more years. I can shave off a year if I switch my major to Civil engineering with an environmental concentration, but I really don't want to do that.   
I have to switch my insurance next year and my current Pdoc and Tdoc don't take my new insurance, which is frustrating beyond reason. 
And the absolute bain of my existence is that I am about 40 lbs (18 kg) overweight. I'm recovering from anorexia and this is just driving me up a wall. I looked at 'thinspo' for hours last night, which only makes things worse. I've recently lost a lot of weight but it doesn't mean anything if I am still overweight.     
I want to reach out to my family and friends but I feel like I can't. My mind is going to very dark places and I don't know how to tell anyone without alarming them. 
Finals are looming and I feel so unprepared, I just wanna hide.  
I see my Tdoc tomorrow, maybe she'll provide some perspective. ",bipolar-disorder
Anxiety about moving on,"I have intended to move to a different home for years now.  When I try to take steps to find another place, I get very anxious.  I'm not sure what specifically causes this.  It might be because many times when I moved it was because of something bad.  Maybe it's because of all the packing and unpacking I'll have to do.  The last time I moved, I didn't have much help.  Awful!
It's stressful because the isn't really much out there that's affordable.
Why I want to move.  I live with my 21 yr old son with Asperger's and his paternal grandmother who has many health problems and can't walk.   This means I have to do pretty much everything thing here.  I, also, work part-time at a local burger restaurant.

something to help perhaps,"so long time no see, I've missed this platform but things have been crazy with college applications and my senior year which I wanted to do well in, a lot has happened which I will hopeflly update on when I get but chance but the reason for this post is, the college essay, I wrote it on my experience being bipolar. I wanted people to see what I went through everyday because at first I wrote it about my first visit to therapy but it did't feel genuine because the question was asking me to write about a challange I had overcome but I didn't feel genuine about it. I didn't feel like I went to therapy and suddenly 'overcame' being bipolar. it wasn't the message I wanted to send to my colleges because I'm not 'all fixed' now Ya know? being this way feels like an everyday challange in which I have to overcome every single day. some days It feels like i'm staring from square one no matter how much progress i'm making. I wanted to be real but I also wanted to show that I was making progress and that everyday while being a challange is something I'm proud of because just making through the day is hard but I still do it, we all do it, everyone here makes it through everyday no amtter how hard and I'm proud of you all. you're all so strong and resiliant for it. so I thought I'd share my essay with you guys bassed on my own daily experience living like this. feel free to critic and tell me what you think and all that cause I send it off to colleges soon haha. I hope this helps some of you guys realize how strong you are and that you got this! :)
now for the essay titled ""push and pull""
“Why me?” I asked.
“Because the universe decided you were strong enough to handle it dear” my dad replied. 
 
I’m no stranger to the dance as old as time, push and pull. I was seventeen the first time I saw a therapist. It was the end of my junior year, but I discovered I’ve been doing this dance long before that. Soon after my initial evaluation I began attending regular sessions. It’s with these regular sessions that they diagnosed me with Bipolar type 2, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. What does that really mean? Sure, I could provide the textbook definition but most still wouldn’t know what it truly means to live my life for “it is not the critic who counts”.  So I thought it’d be interesting to take you through what it means to live a “school day in my life” and you can put yourself in my shoes for a moment. Let's dive right in. 

 5:00am - 7:30am
 I wake up, exhausted, not from lack of sleep, but because I haven’t yet  recovered emotionally from the polite smiles and socialization of the day before. It’s not that I hate it, it’s that I get overwhelmed easily. I feel a sting of resentment but promptly remind myself to push on through and go for a jog to clear my mind, get ready for school and brave myself for the school day that follows. 

 7:30am - 11:30am
 Paranoia hits.  ‘There's something on your pants. Good grief, they’re all looking at you. No.no they’re not. Stop. Walk, just walk and you’ll be okay.’ Push. I know these thoughts are irrational yet they consume my mind until I’m comfortably in the seat of my first class. I’m inexplicably anxious but I continue to push, daring to dance the delicate choreography of push and pull. After all, I have work to do and no one can do it but me. Push. I trudge on, voices in my head, emotions tugging at my heart and a quiet determination that seems to spur me forward in the darkest of moments.    

11:00am - 1:30pm
Class after class, I smile and make conversation with people next to me but struggle to connect to anyone. It’s disheartening and frustrating. I start to feel it, the ache, the ache of hopelessness that takes hold and doesn’t let go. I’m discouraged. Bad memories and emotions push me to the brink.  “I’ve disappointed everyone, Why can’t I focus like everyone else? Everyday is a battle and I’m tired” I push and push until I’m on the brink, so what do I  do?  I pull.    

 1:30pm - 2:30pm
Pull. I offer up a word, a prayer, a hope in exchange for the strength to continue. I take a lunch pass and head to the bathroom. “Breathe, in, and out, in and out, again. Don’t let this win. You can do this. All you can control is now, and now is the time to work.”  I try this for 8 minutes before looking into the mirror, into my tired, brown eyes wondering why I’m bothering in the first place. Then, I remember. I remember all the times I’ve pulled myself up, pushed myself to go beyond the expectation but mostly I remember the joy of learning, of accomplishments and remind myself of all the things I’m allowing these mental illnesses to rob from me. I grow angry at this thought; a new tidal wave of determination rushes over me and I walk back to class, ready to work, ready to learn.  
 Push and pull: The dance that seems to rule my everyday decisions, to push through what I can and pull back and evaluate what I can’t. Life is full of challenges and uncertainty;  I know that when the time comes to face the music, I will persevere. I will dance.

Vilified and being a target,"Since moving to my new ""independent senior home"", I have been vilified and targeted right from day one. I have been here two years.  Neighbors came forward and asked lots of questions and, I, wanting to fit in, perhaps gave too much information about myself. Most of the neighbors have large families, friends, some are still working, have wealth and are in a tight knit group with other tenants here and have been for over 20 years. They wear makeup, wear the latest fashion of clothing, lots of jewelry and most have very strong personalities.  I don't wear anything comparable to this.  They complain about my hair, I cut my own hair as I cannot afford to go to a stylist. 
Now, I am shunned, set apart, gossiped about meanly, aggression displayed towards me.  A plant I kept on my front door shelf got cut up, my items on my front door shelf got stolen. I no longer hang wreaths. People knocking on my front door all hours of the night (could be the Alzheimer's here) So, that's what's happening in my home. I now keep my home spotless and ultra clean.
I no longer participate in community activities and do not go outside my apartment except for doctors appts, where I flee as fast as I can out the front door.  I am now wearing headphones attached to my iphone to show that I will not engage with my neighbors.  I am trying to build a life worth living outside where I live now.
Because I am on Section 8, disabled, have no family at all, no close friends, no wealth, no longer work nor own a car, and let it slip that I had an abusive spouse that put me in a DV Shelter, revealing all this, may have caused the gossip to flourish.  However, as my background was in investative work, they come to me seeking answers about people here they all want to get rid of, which I won't do.  They have scheming parties of which I was invited to when I first moved here and never went back.
One tenant here felt that because I am on Section 8 (Housing Choice Voucher) means I have been Section 8'd, meaning in the old series of ""Mash"" a person that was put under Section 8, meant they are crazy, hence the rumor that I am under Section 8, as my mental health dictates. One tenant advertised that perhaps I should move to a long term mental health facility and that spread around.  Then next, that I was incarcerated and because I was keeping out of sight for long periods of time, they wanted to believe I committed a crime.
Last week, when I was playing Bingo in my building, everytime I won, the person who was running the game, would approach me, look me in the eye and drop my winnings on the floor all the while watching me.  I only won twice.  I also brought coins to play and she knocked them on the floor and said that coins are not allowed here, only dollar bills.  I could have left, but I played out the entire game, left the money on the floor and left quickly.  I will never play again
Since declaring bankruptcy I have to rebuild my credit history so new places to rent will see I have re-established good credit.  So, I'm stuck here for the next two years. 
This targeting of me is intense and occurs almost daily. It is affecting every aspect of my life now.  I brought this to the attention of my property manager and her only comment is that this is an ""independent senior home"" and she will do nothing about it. 
I feel trapped, having no quality of life, nothing to really normalize me.  So, I sit frozen in my recliner waiting for the next attack.  I am afraid the history of the opinion of my vet will follow me to the next clinic I see care for him.  Other than keeping my home spotless and staying in my home and not participating in community activities here is the only way I will survive this ordeal.

Uncontrollable Sobbing,"Hello - first time poster here and looking for insight...while I've been battling Bipolar Disorder 1 for 23 years (since the age of 12, not diagnosed correctly till age 26) this is the first time I've ever had uncontrollable sobbing. I've gone through crying spells and am just an emotional person overall but lately (especially after dark) I've been sobbing - like can't catch my breath, entire body shaking, and sometimes I cry so hard I am vomiting. I feel especially dark during the sobbing, like in so much mental anguish I can't even describe. My days seem gloomier and it's like everything just comes to a head at night and I lose all my strength. I feel urges that I haven't felt in years come on, but have fought this disorder so long that I know better than to act...because things do get better. I see a psychiatrist and am well medicated, but this just came out of nowhere and I'm suffering and fighting so hard, I just feel at a loss. Anyone else experience this? I honestly don't know exactly what I'm looking for besides some support or confirmation. Feeling alone and trapped in my disorder...",bipolar-disorder
A computer tip...,"Just a little computer tip for those who compute. Get a frosted, glass mouse pad. They are awesome for accurate mouse movements. I have one by a company that folded. It's called ""Ice Mat"". It rocks. I clean it when it gets gunky with a little ceramic, stove top cleaner. Presto, good tracking...like new. Better than alumium ones. Or even plastic ones. Those get ruts in the surface and your mouse movements become unpredictable. ",bipolar-disorder
"Going Up and Going Down, next floor please !!","I rode the entire rollercoaster today.  Started with one good thing. Met my new psychiatrist and I like her.  She came highly recommended.  She wants to see me every two weeks for awhile.  She feels my mood is way out of control and worsening. She felt that it's not the Lamictal causing more Hypomania, it's me she suspects.  She was very non-judgmental and I felt comfortable opening up with her on the first appointment. I am increasing Lamictal to 75 mg from 50 mg and I am off Seroquel (due to gaining 30 pounds in 4 months) and onto Zyprexa.  In a weird way, I felt Seroquel cause me to feel angry and that is not me.
Then came home to a very disparaging phone call from the office manager of my vet.  She felt I am not a good fit with their clinic as I made the receptionist cry and got demanding when the vet took 3 days to return my phone call.   
I felt she was very heavy handed with me. 
Initially, my reaction was that this was a life or death situation for me as I felt myself going over the edge.  Ordinarily I would have gone over the edge, but I have to credit the Lamictal with giving me the ability to calm down right away and get a grip.  So, I am okay tonight and I feel much better moving on to find a new vet who not dispute what I tell them.  Sam is off all his medications for now, so will see how he is in a month or so. 
So, I rode the elevator going up and rode the elevator going down today, only there wasn't a man sitting there asking what floor, lol.

Morning Routine,"Would you please help me by sharing your morning routine that gets you moving for the day...for me, it's just the basic, tomorrow I Won't Go Back To Bed....and I'm putting out my cloths tonight to get dressed first thing...even before I feed my cat.  I feed my cat, take my med, then have to wait an hour before I can eat. Going back to bed is so easy.
The biggest challenge I face is no structure, nothing to do of importance, don't have to leave the house....I get lost on my computer, or reading a book...so easy.
For the first time today I got dressed, since Wednesday, nothing fancy where I could go somewhere...I couldn't stand myself.
Tomorrow I will have a clean counter with no dishes in the sink, the first time in a week...I still have some pans that need washing.
Jan said baby steps, for nearly my whole life I've been baby stepping and I'm just tired and really feel no hope that much will change. When I worked I got so much more done. Now I can't work. I'd like to volunteer, however I don't because I don't want to let anyone down.",bipolar-disorder
I'm Sorry,"I feel very badly about posting of ""my own feelings towards pills' and the desire to have proactive health measures first before pills. 
My intention was not to upset anyone, or to put down the medical field...not even close.
I'm taking a medication that helps my mental health. No pill can fix cancer, no pill can bring back my kidney function.  I'm doing what I can through diet and exercise to keep my remaining kidney functioning. 
My son, 23, is taking a medication because of his sedate life, his choice, which lead to 4 blood clots, both lungs and legs. I Thank God for the medication he has the ability to take to keep him alive. This is where I guess my trigger comes from, even today the focus is not on his 100lb over weight body...but again, it's his choice. I will say I'm very proud of him that he is doing what the dr's told him he needed to do...exercise, watch his diet, and stop drinking sport drinks and switch to water. 
I guess my own thoughts might be better kept to myself.
Again I'm sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings...

Can urological issues trigger Hypomania?,"Saw my primary today and I asked her if urological issues could cause an uptick in Hypomania.  She could not answer that question.
I had heard that urinary infections can cause certain behavioral issues, she said to ask my new psychiatrist.
Over the past 2 months I have had symptoms of kidney stones.  Have had these for years, so kinda know what is what when it happens.  So, it's happening again three weeks after my last kidney stone.  Only my doctor thinks with the way the lab results showed that this could be something else and not a kidney stone.  So, waiting for more labwork to see what's up. In the meantime she referred me to a kidney doc and a urologist................... great, my calendar is already crowded with other doctor appts for the next two months.
The aging process has not been kind to me.  Big sigh.",bipolar-disorder
Riding my moods with my cat's many moods,"I tried adopting kittens and full grown cats, but they all came to me very ill and never survived not to mention the vet bills accompanied with all this. I kept a feral communty but my landlord opposed this, so this time I decided to buy a kitten, worse mistake.
6 years ago, the love of my life passed away in my arms.  I had this cat for 13 years and I still grieve over his loss. In fact on the one year anniversary of his passing, I had to be hospitalized to keep me from self harm.  Fast forward to now.
My kitten is a Ragdoll and is 17 months old.  The first day I had him I noticed very pecular behaviors.  He could not walk across the room to get to me, he would walk along the wall.  Things got worse for him and for me.  Riding his many odd moods and odd behaviors caused alot of depression and mood swings, I couldn't sleep at night. I was determined to save this kitten.  Learned later on that my kitten came from a person posing as a breeder.  She bought all these kittens from a cat mill and hence the issues I am having with my cat Sam now.  I named him Sam-I-Am because it's all about him, lol. 
He has numerous congenital issues, ranging from Feline Hyperthesia, to seizures, to nystagmous/balance issues, GI issues, urinary issues, joint issues and many more health issues.  He keeps me at the vets monthly, so I can't save for myself or buy anything for myself.  He is on a special needs diet with lots of medications throughout the day.  He used to be a bitter and has a fear based personality, but over the past 12 months with all his behavior medications and learning to trust me, that has almost gone away, it really is day to day.  I am now on Meals on Wheels because I cannot afford to buy my food and I weigh my budget against his needs. 
I worked for a veterinarian part time years ago and love animal husbandry.  I grew up with animals galore and spent all my time in a barn caring for all the barn animals too. Riding horses was my passion. Hugging a horse is the best therapy. But can't access horses now due to my Ataxia. So, I understand and have the knowledge and drive to make Sam survive.  He may not have a long life but the life he has with me will be the best for him.
My home is designed into Cat Shui instead of Feng Shui, or I now call it the house of Cat Shui, lol.  Martha Stewart would be appauled the way I have my home set up.  I learned alot watching Jackson Galaxy on Animal Planet on how to make my home suitable for living with a special needs cat.  I also have had a pet behaviorist consult with me over Sam's many perplexing behaviors.
So, my reason for getting another cat is so that I can go to a cat for comfort, but it is now the other way around.  I do have him designated as a ""Special Needs Cat"" so I don't have to pay monthly pet rent nor a high deposit to keep him here. But he truly has turned into a special needs cat for all the care he requires. It's not his fault what happened to him while growing up in a small cage.
Riding his many peculiar moods and health crises and health issues has not grounded me very well in this world. It seems I get all the sick animals.  I will never be a rich person financially due to all the vet bills but my life has become richer for having these special needs critters in my life.
So, I am faced with another dilemna.  With Sam's mounting monthly medication needs and vet visits, my budget has become soo incredibly tight.  I just cannot give him away, it would tear me apart and I don't think I would get over this, especially at my age.  So, I choose to keep him and even though his health issues keep mounting, I grow even fonder of him and I want him to survive.  If I can't save myself, then maybe I can save him. 
With my Agoraphobia and panic attacks and having to arrange rides to the vets is very scary for me. Leaving home is frightening. I no longer have a designated friend who cares enough to get me to the vets and back again safely and will stay with me.  Uber has left me on the side of the road with no way home from my vets, now twice, I experienced that two weeks ago. 
Lots of obsticles owning this cat, lots of tough decisions.  Riding his many moods, swinging from nice cat to mad cat has not been easy. 
I have been keeping an excel spreadsheet to help me manage his many medications so I don't forget and other things about him, along with his mood.  I discovered yesterday that his Hyperthesia Episodes occur at the same day as my panic attacks, migraine and seizures. I know I am going to have either a seizure of migraine because he comes right up to my face and stares at me unrelenting.  When I am into a migraine with aura and tinnitus, he will howl.  So, finding that we both affect each other.
I have at times, put him in the bathroom for timeout as some days I cannot cope with his intensity of needs.  It's called ""parental tough-love"".  But that is working now for me to give me time out from his many demands of my time.  I am now keeping him on a schedule of playtime, medication, and grooming/massage and it seems to be working.  But by attending to all his structure I loose track of mine. Like mornings I try to sit in front of my light box for an hour while waking up with coffee and answering emails. He can't stand that I am devoting my time to just sitting in front of my monitor and under a lightbox, he starts racing around crashing into things and yowling loudly. 
I live in a independent senior facility due to my Ataxia and no longer have the support system I used to have, so I am alone in the world with only Sam.  It's not a great place to live in due to my exposure to death and dying and various stages of demenia all around me.  I no longer show up for community activities due to the bullying that goes on here, so I keep to myself and isolate from the world.  My social calendar is all about doctors appointments.  So, Sam is my only source of comfort in this world now. 
Thanks for listening, didn't mean to make this soo long. ",bipolar-disorder
This Bugs Me OT,"My Mom used to take like 20 pills a day, some times more if she had a flair of something..most often prednisone. 
For blood pressure cholesterol, they give you a pill when walking and diet will both lower blood pressure.
When I go to the dr for a body ache, they give me a pill.
When I go to my Pdoc, if I'm having a problem he gives me a pill or wants to increase my meds.
Why I ask?
In our world, more and more I feel like a number and electronic, is this how we are seen?
Dr offices, back to back scheduling 15/20 minutes in and out.
Why is our system not focused on Healing By Foods, Exercise, Meditation as a replacement for drugs?
The simple way to keeping health is to drink filtered water, 1/2 your body weight per day.
Exercise 30 minutes a day, just walking....my son who has three blood clots at 23 walks with a timer, as soon as it hits 15 minutes he turns around and goes back. 
You can even help yourself by exercising in a chair! https://dailycaring.com/video-easy-effective-10-minute-chair-exercises-for-seniors/
Then diet, just stop drinking coke especially or any type of soda. You'll be way ahead of your health, and way ahead of controling your health. Did you know if you soak rusted metal in coke, it Removes The Rust? To clean silver, 7 up or Sprite...gee wonder what they do to your stomach?
We do have great dr's, just wondering if we really do need all the medications we are prescribed...What Do You Think?",bipolar-disorder
I got the jobs officially,"Thank you for your thoughts and prayers! I got the internal position and the outside position. They offered the same pay! So I start the internal position Monday the 18th. But little do they know I'll be leaving the company to start working at the hospital December 9th. I'm so excited to work for the hospital. I'm glad I'm not at the same location as my pdoc #awkward literally during the interview. When I was done with the interview I walked across the hall to make it to my apt with my pdoc the day of my interview. I feel Jesus came through so fast. I literally looked for a job a week and God came through uber quick. #JESUSISREAL You guys I feel like I'm on autopilot everyday. Have you ever seen the movie Venom or the movie upgrade? I feel like Eddie Brock from Venom accept Jesus is helping me walk, drive, work, go to the library, shower brush my teeth, spray down with body spray, do my hair and as a biracial woman doing my hair is a journey in itself. I don't know how I'm functioning. LIKE SERIOUSLY HOW AM I FUNCTIONING? Jesus is literally carrying me. When I was at the library looking for a job I felt like I was going to faint. I don't feel safe driving. I left my ex and I'm so off at times as I process what happened to me in 4 years. Twice at 2 different stores I forgot my shopping bags. Thank God the clerks put them aside. Yesterday I forgot my wallet at petsmart. I'm a complete mess. I'm reading my domestic violence books. I fired that EAP thearpists after session 7 I told you about. I'm focused on my domestic violence therapists who is great. I'm emotionally rundown. Lately, I stay in bed. I finally started crying. Suicidal thoughts here and there. Anger and disgust with my ex. Panic attacks and anxiety daily.  I'm just grateful that at the very least  I am out of this job. God won't give you more than you can handle. Now I can enjoy my new job at the hospital work a normal 8-5 and go home scream in a pillow and ""process"" at least 70% of my stress is off my chest. Cause at one point it felt like there was a hippo on my chest.  Now my heart feels punched daily.",bipolar-disorder
Depressed?,"First thing, I can't tell you how much help and such gratitude I felt as I read each post in response to my questions to help me get out of bad, really bad place I've been in for nearly a year. Yes a few glimmers of light, sadly more darkness. I think it was Friday I'd been alone and not talked to anyone for several days, I just got to the point where I couldnot stand myself....the support was Wonderful. Thank You To All Who Posted to my questions and gave me answers to support me!!
In 2010 I was hospitalized for 11 days due to severe depression, I just couldn't do even the basic stuff like eating. Anywho, while there a mental health worker said to me just a few words which have served me well with each depression over the years since. Sadly I don't go hypo, I go into my worm hole like 95% of the time.
Move a muscle and change a thought.....So what do you think about this and how it might work for you when depressed?
For me, when in depression, I don't believe anything will change, moving a muscle and changing a thought brings an ""I'm In Control"" over my choice, it's my choice and how I Move or Don't Move will change my actions and feelings.
Jan was right, and so many others with all their mental health tools....all we can do is to ""baby step"" our way out of the hole of depression until we reach the stage where we can crawl, then get up and walk again.
For me, my mind takes me to a place of such disgust for myself, feelings of over whelmed and where do I even start....well that is where ""move a muscle and change a thought"" can kick start me to just doing something so simple as getting out of bed, or taking a shower and brushing my teeth, then getting dressed....so simple for typical people, yet such a hurdle to jump for us at times of stress/emotions.
Another gal in a DBT class when I was depressed, some one said ""Don't Be So Hard On Yourself""....to which she replied ""are you being too soft on yourself""... meaning not doing anything at all cause of just not feeling like it....that is again where move a muscle and change a thought comes right back....I've found this over and over again, if I can get myself dressed, music on I'm So Much more likely to move.

Doing Well,"Hi guys,
   I haven't posted in a long while but I continue to do well. I've been stable for nearly 2 years and started working full time in August. It's been great. My coworkers and boss are all very supportive. It is a great environment to work in though we don't get paid much. We do get incremental pay raises so in a couple of years I'll be making the kind of money I've been hoping for. I continue to do well on Latuda and continue to practice DBT when needed. Only go to my therapist every other week now and I see the psychiatrist every 3 months. I think I'm doing well due to the meds, psychotherapy and self care but my pscychiatrist says I have really mild bipolar 2. Hope you are all well!",bipolar-disorder

Depakote,"So, I was on over 100mg of Effexor. I was literally jumping out of my skin. Sweating bullets. I am a sweater anyway. Its on my moms side. Also I am over weight. I could not let circular thoughts go. I was really just bombarding my brain with repeated and same thoughts. 
So they started me on Depakote. I noticed I could let those cirular thoughts go. They were negative and I was doing it to myself for some reason. So I was happy to be more mellow. I hear that Depakote causes issues with liver, hair, and weight gain. I am most conserned with liver. I don't want my liver cashing out on me. I do think of death, but I know if your liver goes, thats not good. My hair, meh its gone already anyway. Weigh gain, I better start eating less. Liver is most important. 
I am on three 500mg of Depakotes. One thing that I did notice is my jaw, when eating...I tend to be kinda hesitant in biting down? Like biting through a hambuger. My jaw will hesitate a bit while biting though. Not sure. Maybe thats just me? Otherwise, if Depakote keeps me more mellow and lets me not do the circular thoughts as much, then I am all for it. ",bipolar-disorder

Disclosed Meds open to doctors & veterinarians,"I learned several weeks ago that my psychiatrist has a list of all my medications going back quite a while.  Where I was initially shocked that he has this information, when he showed me the list, I am learning here in this group that alot of providers do access this information.  So here is what I wrote in my previous thread about issues with my psychiatrist:
""One of the problems I have is that my cat is on alot of medications (Prozac, Gabapentin, Prazosin, Phenobarbitol, Clindamycin). This presents a new challenge as my most recent psychiatrist did not believe that I was not taking these medication or to have soo many other medications on hand. So, it becomes a sticky-wicket for me. I guess that is why I was soo dismayed when my psychiatrist showed me the printout of all my medications. Now, can veterinarians pull the medication history to see if I am giving my cat his prescribed medication since they are all intermixed and will my veterinarian see what I am prescribed since alot of my meds are under ""controlled substances""? Will my vet be able to see my medications?"" I know some veterinarian's do have a similar reporting system for their drugs that are controlled substances if they dispense more than 3 pills per month.
This is a huge concern for me now as I do not want my veterinarian to know what medications I am taking.",bipolar-disorder
I was triggered!,"I don't know if it's my inner teenager or inner toddler, but there is this angry resistance inside of me that causes me not to be able to think straight!!!

I've been depression free since this same time last year and I'm afraid I will fall into another depression this year again!
It also seems like my inner toddler wants to mope, complain, and cry!
I don't even know what I hope to accomplish by posting this! Maybe some clarity as to what I CAN do! or should I say ""I'm WILLING to do"". I know the way of forcing myself usually results in me rebelling even more! or afterwards thinking that ""big deal, you haven't accomplished anything""!

Bad day,"My dog dislocated her knee so I have been taking care of her but in the process her breathing just got worse. She is thirteen and was panting 24/7.

Am I Hypomanic vs. Mixed State vs Mania?,"Having difficulty discerning between the two, this is soo hard as I don't have anyone who has seen me in these states to help report what I go thru, so self reporting is all I have.  Interested in what others here have experienced with both of these states.
For me, what I think a Mixed State is when I feel intense emotions all at once. I feel like I am being scrambled with too many emotions at once and can't stand it.  I can't figure out how to help myself while in this state. The only way out is to take extra medication if I can mentally do this, go to sleep and when I wake, that awful mood is gone. Is this Mixed State?
For an experience of Hypomania, I spend freely disregarding consequences, am ultra social - engaging people I never would, very chatty moving between topics rapidly, ultra high energy and never want to sleep and can go days without sleep. So, is this Hypomania or Mania?
Not sure about Mania ~ I do know one blizzard I got into my SUV and went to a highway to do donuts at total disregard to my safety. I was actually on the oncoming traffic side, but I didn't care.  I felt high, higher than I ever did.  But it did not last long and was able to get home safely.  Never had that high before. But I will never forget that day.
Mostly I live a day walking thru mud as I have been depressed since childhood.  I feel very sad all day long.  No energy, lack of interest in anything.  I no longer do fiber arts, exercise, eat healthy, take care of hygiene, go days in the same clothing, isolate, experience anger alot of the day or irritability or that I am constantly in a bad mood.  And very little impulse control, I fly off the handle or have a hair trigger on my anger. 
I am no fun to be around. 
Lamictal is now helping me connect to reality.  I feel I can occasionally balance my bank account and gradually get things done and I can think thru things, wereas before my brain felt like mush.  I noticed once I started taking Seroquel, I started feeling aggressive and ultra angry at times that would come out of the blue.  I have never hurt anyone or myself, just feel I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to control myself and finding ways to handle rapid emotions.  I think it's the rapid emotions that wear me out. 
One more thing, I loose things continually. Then there is the other scary thing that happens to me. My neighbors claim I have been to certain community meetings when I know I have not been there, which is scaring me.  My neighbors claim that I am very antisocial and don't respond to them when they try to talk to me.  They say I appear as if in a trance. I am not DID, so I don't have a clue what's happening to me. My doctors feel there is a line between dissociation and absonse seizures.  I spent a month at a world renown trauma hospital and they felt I was not DID but I do dissociate and I do have absonse seizures.  Okay, I may buy that, but for it to last several hours in a community event is beyond me.
I would not have been able to verbalize all this before Lamictal.  But I realize it may be causing more hypomanic events as I go up in dosage and definately interferring with sleep.  So, for now until I can meet with my new psychiatrist, I remain isolated so no one can witness me this way. 
I hope someone here can help me with this so I can explain it to my new psychiatrist. I'm soo mixed up. I wish I could go into Partial Hospitaliation for long term observation, medication management and stabilization, but due to my insurance being Medicare, no one will admit me. Thank you for reading my thread *smiles*",bipolar-disorder

So Cold,"Today it's 38 degrees in CT. I keep my heat turned down to 54 degrees in my house over night to save oil as the price is so dear, the heat turned on twice. The only reason I get up in the morning is to feed my cat, then I'm back in bed within a few minutes.
Over the last 6 months or so, I'm lost in a depression, rendering me daily to do nothing much. I know I could be doing more but just am lazy. I went to my dr the other day and my kidney function went down to 29% from 33%, I only have one kidney.
One of the areas that is most concerning to me is feeling overwhelmed with my house and trying to do repairs so I can sell in the spring, saving money to do the repairs. I was driving myself Nuts looking at condo's, I've stopped doing that now and feel some relief.
My dear son, at 23, since July 23 was diagnossed  with 3 blood clots, one in his lung and two in each leg from groin to calf...if either shift he could die. I was in hospital for 9 days due to a tick bite and my kidney function went down to 17%, 12-15 is usually when dialysis is started.
I am feeling very very old at 66, not strong enough to remain in my house and continue on taking care of my yard...I so love my gardens, they are so much work...and in the fall putting them to bed, well I never did this year. I don't have the money of 200.-- or more to hire someone to come and cut down and take away all that needs to be done.
I just feel alone and overwhelmed which I feel is a huge part of my lethargic living doing nothing I could be doing each day to help myself. I can't take anti depressants cause they are processed through my kidney. I've tried to go to senior center, book clubs etc to meet people and hasn't really worked. I want to go out and walk to exercise, it's so cold and my motivation is nil. 
Has anyone felt this way, unable to take a medication to help and pushed past the ""I Don't Care"" place, cause that is where I am.",bipolar-disorder
POETRY SLAM!!!,"Share a poem you wrote or one you love, lets get creative!
I jsut wrote this one:

I'm Sorry I'm Not Better
I’m sorry I ‘m not better.
 Im sorry I forgot to take the chicken ou for dinner
I didn’t write it down so I didn’t remember.
I’m sorry I didn’t rake the leaves.
I started a new craft project and it absorbed my attention.
I;m sorry I’m not better.
I didn’t know how to check the sump pump
And that is why the basement flooded.
I’ll know for next time.
I’m sorry I’m not better.
I’m sorry for calling you so many times but
When you didn’t answer I got a bad feeling and
I was afraid something bad had happened
So I called until you answered
I’m sorry I’m not better.
I’m sorry I slept through your phone calls
I had bad dreams all night and I was too tired
I missed all 8 of your calls this morning
Im sorry Im not better
I’m sorry I was in the hospital again.
Depression is the friendliest monster and he lured me
Into the suicidal thoughts.
He said I would be better off dead so I took the pills
I’m sorry Im not better.
I’m sorry I didn’t do much around the house today
The dogs were very needy and I felt bad ignoring them
I’m sorry I’m not better
When you asked me what was wrong I said nothing even
Though we both know that is a lie
I’m sorry Im not better
I don’t tell you whats wrong because even
Though I know you worry when I don’t talk
I know you will worry more if I told the truth.
I’m sorry Im not better.
I’ll try harder even though I think we both know it

Have u been offended by therapist?,"So I just got back from thearpy. I was talking about the abuse. She said why do you feel like you have to talk about the abuse? Okay I'm not sure if I'm tripping. I've seen a few randomn thearpists here and there. I'm not really into thearpy unless I really need it and I haven't really liked it. This therapist does not specialize in domestic violence however, she is free through my corporate jobs EAP employee assistance program. I'm not one that goes to thearpy often I'll go like 6 or less sessions every few years or more than that like 7 years . I started seeing her mid August and this was session 7. Am I being too sensitive or was she rude??? Like I'm in there talking about how emtionally drained I am how emotionally run down I feel. I'm  describing the book I'm reading about my circumstance and how I'm processing so much and describing the abuse and thats what she asks.

Psychiatrist advice needed,"I got used to my former psychiatrist of 30 years.  I could call him and he would spend time with me immediately and even call back to check on me the next day.  He retired.
Now I am left with ineffectual psychiatrists. I have been thru 3 in last 6 months. 
Current psychiatrist keeps changing my appt to make it further away.  It's now almost 3 months.  I was dx'd as BPll 6 months ago, put on Lamicatl/Seroquel and left alone to fend for myself. I don't understand BPll and how to navigate thru the new medication and my mood swings. 
I feel this is dangerous that he's soo unavailable to me.  It's during this time that I start to increase medication on my own as he's unavailable to me.  I think waiting almost 3 months to see him again is not appropriate for a new BiPolar patient learning to navigate thru the maze of medications and how to adopt life.
Went thru a Hypomanic event two days ago, increased my medication and went to bed.  Reached out to my new psych doc and nothing.  His front desk receptionist is not passing along much needed requests

I also increased Quetiapine at the same time. 
These are not big increases and was under the doctors advise.
Will be reducing the Lamictal back to the original dose and see how that goes.

Order of protection worth or waste,"My ex has sent around 500 text messages I haven't heard from him since Sunday the 13th. He did send a 22 page hand written letter to my new place by addressing it to himself so that it would be forwarded to my apartment. My ex was keen on getting revenge on people 6 to a year. I do have him blocked. I can still access the texts. Recently he implied suicide. He texted that he doesn't want to be here. I know this is a classic abuse line. However, I'm surprised to hear him use it. He has called me a demon. He said my letter I left him when I moved demonized him.

Just hypothetical of course. I am not going to approach any therpist for a date. I had a mind slip the other day...and wanted to ask one of the therpists out for coffee. Thank God I have a delay reaction (most of the time) between my brain and my mouth.

I am breaking,"This is getting so hard on me emotionally. I'm so emotionally run down. I'm feel like I am on autopilot. I hate my job and I'm mentally over it. I'm in a position where training is limited. My department offers no training for my position and I've struggled because of this. The training from my coworkers is limited because there work load is too heavy. I have no idea what I'm doing at work and its the worst feeling. I have to say this is the worst department. So I decided last week I need to find a job ASAP before January 1st. I'm so emotionally drained I only applied to one job one day last week. Then over the weekend I went to the library to get out of the house and applied to several jobs for 3 hours. I've been to the library every day this week to apply to jobs. It gives me a reason to get out of the house. I also applied internally. I feel like I'm having an outter body experience every day I feel like I'm going to faint. Everyday I feel like I've been punched in the heart. I did a interview on the phone with recruiter for the largest hospital in my state and she was nice and is going to set up an interview based on the managers schedule. Both locations are close but I would want the location closest to me. Then another recruiter from the same hospital contacted me and she is setting up an interview with a manager as well. This location is close to. I have no idea how 2 recruiters from the same healthcare  facility contacted me. But its a huge health facility. Now the internal position I applied for is offering me a very nice pay increase. Now that would be great and its an internal I'd have to drive to a different location and its close but my ex will not know where I work and this position allows me to work from home. I work from home now and that is the only benefit of my job plus insane discounts on meds because its a pharmaceutical corporate. This internal position offers substantial training. The recruiter wants me to interview tomorrow but my manager has to appprove. My manager is aware of my domestic violent situation. I'm  hoping she approves the interview. I'm so stressed I'm so scared. I don't  know what I'm doing. I hate  tge corporate companies make the current manager ok the interview. I'm crying and breaking down of all times to have to find a job. I literally cannot go on in my current position. I'm so freaked out each position will pay what I'm requesting.  I just feel like time is running out. I have to be out of this position before January. I have never been in a position where I don't know how to do my job. Its unreal they have  no training throw you assignments ask for help but their to busy. Therefore my work isn't quality. I hate this position.  I'm still processing daily what the hell happened in my relationship. I feel like I can't do this. I'd  rather be in heaven than deal with this. I know I just started applying  last week but the urgency is imperative. I'm only one person I can't take this. I'm 34 childless infertile, I have no family members no friends other than  1 associate. I feel so alone and I'm scared. I feel myself doing everything but I'm straight stressed terrified. Plus leaving him after years. I slept 4 hrs last night. I had another work issue. I'm breaking and I'm so unprepared after blowing through my exit fund.",bipolar-disorder

TW Seeing Things TW,"So we have a stray cat hanging around our house and I feed it. Earlier when I let the dogs out I saw it was taking shelter from the rain under our back deck. Tonight while letting the dogs out I peeked under the deck to see it but it was so dark all I could see was a massive form in the middle and I swear to God I saw a man with a large gun pointed at me! I backed up slowly and went inside to tell my dad. Now I know how crazy it would sound so at first I just said there is someone under the deck then I said and they have a gun. He smirked like, ""yeah right"". But he got up and got a flashlight and went out to check. There was nothing there. 
I told him not to tell mom cause I don't need her worrying more about me being paranoid. I went back just now to look and the big form I saw was a pile of plastic. So am I going crazy? I feel like I am.

This time I felt the mood swing coming and talked to my doctor about it before it was even fully settled in. I refused his offer of upping my meds again, because at some point I have to learn to live with this. I don't regret saying no to more meds, but at the same time, I feel like every bit of me is getting pulled in different directions trying to fight off the things in my head.
I want to cut my hair. Dye it purple. Get a new tattoo. Get a few new piercings. Buy new furniture. Open a new credit card. Paint the house. Redo the bathrooms. Get another pet. Drive 100 mph down the freeway. Sing and dance until I lose my voice. Find a random person to ruin my marriage with. Eat everything in the house. Eat nothing. I'm twitchy. I can't sit still, I can't focus on what's in front of me. I'm angry, then I'm crying. I have this feeling that I need to do something to be famous.

I could not find it listed on the Internet! Does anyone know what the withdrawal effects are of paroxetine from what you've read or personal experience?

I need advice,I had an internal interview with job for benefits verification today. Right now I HATE MY POSITION. The internal position I applied for pays a little bit more. The gave me a range and its not guaranteed I'll get the higher end of the range. Now the down fall of the internal position hours are 11-7:30 pm these hours really suck. Plus I found out that there work from home is extremely limited. But I'm fine with that because I need to get out of my current position stat. So the other job is outside of my organization. The hours are 8-5:30 this job seems less stressful its another health administrative position. The pay range is pretty much the same. I just joined the domestic violent support group and if I take tthe internal position I won't be able to go to group. Obviously I don't know if got the jobs. Either position frees me of this curent position nightmare. I'm just nervous because if my internal position pays more even if its by some coins I'm not sure if I should take it or just go to the hospital.

How can I change these sleepless nights that feed the high I do not know I have tried everything nothing puts me to sleep until I come down so I guess for now I have to just live with this and try to limit my spending and creative output and try to keep them at a minimum I can donate some stuff to the craft club but it seems such a waste,bipolar-disorder

Misdiagnosed,"I'm curious if anyone has heard about people being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder. I started seeing a psychologist after a breakup because I was severely depressed and hyperactive and he suggested that I may be bipolar with ultra rapid cycling. At the time I would cycle between hypomanic and depressed in the course of three days and sometimes in the course of a single day. I'm on meds now and don't have any symptoms at all. But I have tried to go off my meds a couple times and immediately became depressed and hyperactive.

Desipite all this, I find it hard to believe that I'm bipolar because my symptoms didn't show up until the age of 33 immediately after a very difficult break up. The break up seemed to trigger this whole thing. Regarding age, it's my understanding that most people have symptoms show up much earlier in life. I also find it suspicious that I didn't have long manic or depressed states. As I said earlier, I would cycle in the matter of a couple days, which I understand is pretty rare.

It should be noted that before the diagnosis I suffered from pretty low self-esteem, had a pretty bad childhood, and was in a shitty life situation. I am quite certain that a lot of the depression I experienced was a result of these factors. The hypomania seemed like a means of compensatining for feeling so shitty inside.

What I think is strange is that it took about a year of taking meds before my symptoms dissolved. The meds, abilify and lamotrigine, didn't work right away. I was doing therapy, working on myself, and making lifestyle changes in combination with the meds. Eventually my symptoms disappeared. It was as if I really had to work on some stuff before I could feel better inside.

Does anyone think that I may have been misdiagnosed?

I am hopeful that one day I can go off my meds because I have gained 25-30 pounds and I feel terrible.",bipolar-disorder

I went to a domestic violent group,"So I reached out to my neighborhood police station. The cop referred me to a police counselor that deals with domestic violence. I called and I called and I called. The police counselor  gave me 2 places to call. The first place offers free counseling but no domestic violent group. 2nd place offers free counseling AND has a domestic violent group. So I know this might sound bananas. But I signed up for both programs. So I'll have 3 separate therapists.  So I have my thearpist that I started seeing in August through my jobs EAP thats 12 free sessions at work. I'm on session 6. Now this thearpist has me reading a book called ""woman who love to much"" by Robin Norwood. I have only read one chapter and I don't feel like it relates to me. But I'm keeping an open mind. I am reading ""Psychopath Free: recovering from emotionally abusive relationships with narcissists, sociopaths and other toxic people"" this book I chose on my own. So far it relates so much to my situation because it focuses on aftermath. The downfall is the author focuses on the abuser dumping the victim. I left my abuser. I'm not done yet with the book the author touched on victims leaving the abuser first. But it was brief. So today I sat with my 2nd and new thearpist that specializes in domestic violence. She was able to explain things better than the EAP therapists and already help me see that what I told her is about control. I just don't understand how someone needs that type of control! The 2nd counselor offered for me to stay with group. Group was small just me and another lady. They let me talk a bit more since I'm new and already I'm seeing things its like I'm waking up. Today is ONE MONTH since I moved out!! The 3rd counselor from the other town has not called me. But I'm taking advantage of resources. I have no friends and I'm trying to process what the hell just happened to me. I just want to heal and talk. I was brutally honest in group. I didn't feel judged. I really want to find a book that focuses on recovery when the victim leaves the abuser FIRST. ",bipolar-disorder

Anyone Do This?,"I got these two sites from Irish, asking her about her diet for anti inflamation. I'll be writing up a paper of sort from a talk I went to last week about mental health and diet...a nutritional/therapist gave the talk. I'm trying to find ways to help my mental health, my stomach, and whole body to improve my health. I'm lucky in that I don't have too many illnesses or body pain...my main problem are isolation and lack of exercise. I don't have my main passion, gardening, too cold now and going into winter I'll really need a plan to help with depression and worse isolation. It's so easy to just stay home in my pj's.
Then next week I'll be going to a talk about how to reduce cravings....sugar and carbs just get me, can't even bring them into my house!

TMS Treatment,"My psych doc recently suggested TMS treatment for me. I'm scared and hesitant about it. I'm not currently depressed and my anit depressants are working! The main symptom I'm concerned about is anxiety. I never feel settled! I'm always hypervigilant. My anxiety varies from mild to moderate.
I was wondering if anyone here has had the TMS procedure done and how it worked for you? They say, it enhances your quality of life! I wonder if that's true?
I appreciate any personal experiences or information that can guide in my decision.
Thank you in advance.",bipolar-disorder

Upside down,"I have been home now almost two weeks from a wonderful vacation.  I love the outdoors and spent two weeks doing just that with changing fall colors. It couldn't have been more perfect. Maybe that was the problem. 
Now my life has hit me in the face hard.  I realize you can't live in ""vacation land"" but man this really sucks. Reality. No  real job, twin babies that I'm scared to death I will screw them up just no reason. By feeling this way my rough feelings about my mother is just so strong. I don't understand how a mother could hate their kid. My mom hates me she told me daily. No I don't talk to her anymore but it is just hard to understand. My ex husband committed suicide during the divorce and even those feelings are coming up. I miss my best friend who passed away so much too. Everything is just falling on top of me.  Today I can't get out of my head that my babies would be better off having another mom. Shit maybe my mom is right. 
I don't think I will be ever stable and I'm just tired and hate it . Meds and therapy just makes no difference for me. I'm beginning to feel I just can't be helped anymore.  Got to go babies up from nap got to keep it together.  Pema",bipolar-disorder

First day of new job,"Well my first day actually wasn't that great. The address they have me was incorrect and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't find the house. Turns out they put the address in wrong  and the place I needed to be was in a town 40 minutes from where I was. Then I get to the right street but the house number is wrong so I pull onto a side street while I call the office who also has no idea where the house is. They had to use google maps to send me a picture of the house. So since they have me the wrong address I arrived an hour late but they clocked me in at the original start time. On the way home my fuel light came on and I have no money for gas so thankfully I made it home and have nowhere to go till Friday. I can't talk about the client or her home due to confidentiality but I will say as soon as I got home I went straight to the bathroom, stripped, and scrubbed my entire body in a hot shower. I took everything I was wearing and put it in the wash with hot water. Friday is supposed to be an easier job but we shall see.",bipolar-disorder
Therapists gone BAD,"So I talk a lot about my first therapist who basically abandoned me after I attempted suicide. I brought her up with my current therapist and just based on what I've told her, my current doc thinks my first one crossed a major line. New t thinks old t crossed boundaries and was treating me in a ""friend"" way. Old t shared a lot of personal stuff with me and was very loose with her language. She let me get so attached to her then just dropped me.  Current t thinks old t just had a lot of personal issues going on and lost her handle on things. But really I'll never know what happened for sure and that is still so hard to accept. So new t is trying to repair the damage done by old t to me which is a lot apparently. New t never shares personal info, except I did ask once if she has children and she told me she does have one grown son. But she never brings up personal stuff, doesn't even have any photos on her desk. It's a strange dynamic and I wonder if this is how it's supposed to be? anyway, just wanted to share this and get your thoughts. ",bipolar-disorder

How to forgive my mom,"I'm struggling this week. My mom has bipolar and borderline and I've suffered a lifetime of ups and downs. I moved across the country to be away from her. Recently my mom came to visit and she had a major meltdown. I don't know what else to call it. She gets into moods so black and dark nothing helps and everything I do backfires. She screamed and screamed at me about traffic. She belittled the work I do and went so far as to tell me she wishes I'd nwver been born. Mostly because she was tired, and hungry (these episodes often happen when she's tired) and despite my efforts to try and calm her and talk to her and take deep breaths everything I said or did was wrong. 
She's said and done horrible abusive things to me since I was a child (including hitting me, making me walk home in the rain because I didn't want to listen to her music when I was 10, she would forget me places, and called me a bitch and a slut and worthless constantly in my teenage years and has said before she wishes she nwver had kids because we ruined her life...I have 2 older sisters) but to go so far as to tell me I should be dead and she wishes I wasn't her daughter was the most damaging. 
i don't know how to forgive her, or even how to love her, and yet, she's my mom. I've always wanted to support her, I've always wanted her to say she's proud of me and mean it. I've always wanted to make her love me. 
I need advice because I'm so angry right now. And I've talked to my therapist, I've talked to my sisters, I've talked to one of my moms really good childhood friends, but I'm still feeling lost. ",bipolar-disorder

I enjoy going to the grocery store, just wandering the aisles, thinking up recipes, things to cook on the weekends, I don't like food, but I love to cook it.
I enjoy stopping by the local Animal Shelter on the way home from work a few days a month, they have a great ""Kitten room"" and I'll go in and just let the Kittens climb and play and purr on me....best stress therapy in the world!!
...and I love work and my work family, they're crazy, they drive me crazy some days....but any one of them would do anything in the world for me, as I would for them.   And when I'm in my office, I'm in my world, designed to work around my brain...

Dominating and intimidating persons,Last night I went to a bible study and the group leader really caught me off guard. He goes t my church but I don’t really know him. Anyway he is so passionate and full of the Holt spirit but his personality is very intimidating. I told him so. He is so serious and when I told him that he said scripture is serious. Yeah but I was expecting a laid back time of fellowship and studying gods Word. I talked to my pastor about it(she was there too) and she said that is just his personality. I guess he used to live a very loose and sinful life and then when he found Jesus he changed drastically and now he is all about religion. It’s just very intimidating.  In fact he reminds me of my psychotic deranged biological father who told me he is greater than God. Anyway it’s kinda scary. I want to keep going to the Bible study but I can’t seem to get past this guys dominating personality. Just wondering if anyone has any advice?,bipolar-disorder
I decided to leave my job after 3 years,"After going several months with below average pay (since I work commission only and don't even get minimum wage) I decided to find another job. Ends up I did and got hired part time with the same amount of hours but this time with a regular wage. I decided to finish the week out at my  low paying job. The girls here are visibly upset and giving me the silent treatment. The thing is I tried to tell my boss over several months that I needed to be put on better hours with more customers but she refused to do that for me. The reason the boss has refused is because she doesn't want to work evenings..they inconvenience her. Well the boss is also the owner and in my opinion the owner needs to work whenever necessary to keep the business afloat. Besides she has a large clientele and could fill in those hours with her regulars. So now I have to endure the rest of this week with co workers being rude.

I feel like just walking out.",bipolar-disorder

I thought I made new “friends”,"Last time I was in the hospital I made “friends” with a few of the other patients. We exchanged numbers and hugged and went our separate ways. The first few days out I texted one girl particularly and we made plans to hang out. She never showed up. Then a week or so later I went to one of the other girls homes where both girls were just sitting getting John and coloring. Ok, no big deal. We were friends on Facebook until today. I kept trying to text the one girl who is a bit younger than me and she never responds. I see her posts on Facebook and ask her how she is and no response. But I also see she is hanging out with the other girl and they post shit online. I tried to branch out and make friends but turns out no one has time for me. I’m sick of it. I know they say not to exchange personal information with other patients and believe me I never will again. I’m just sad cause I’m the hospital we got along so well and now they want nothing to do with me. They could at least be honest and say they don’t want to be friends.

One of the most important sleep hygiene practices is to spend an appropriate amount of time asleep in bed, not too little or too excessive.  Sleep needs vary across ages and are especially impacted by lifestyle and health.  Good sleep hygiene practices include:
It can take time and repetition to “re-train” your body and brain into a good Sleep Hygiene cycle, it does not happen overnight.  So, don’t give up, be persistent.  Sleep Hygiene does work if you keep with it and make it a priority.",bipolar-disorder

Pregnancy pillow for anxiety?,"So I’m totally making this shit up. But it makes sense to me! I sleep with a half dozen pillows plus two large dogs. I have one pillow to rest my head on and a large body pillow to hug and wrap my legs around. 
When my sister was pregnant, she bought  a pregnancy pillow. It’s a giant u shaped pillow designed to help a pregnant lady sleep comfortabley. I actually love the thing! 
Anyway, because of its u shaped design, it’s like being hugged from both sides. When I slept at my ex’s, I liked to spoon with him. Ya know I sleep in front of him with my back against his chest and I liked to be held tight. When I sleep alone I like heavy blankets or lots of dogs haha. 
So im pulling this out of my ass, but I had the genius idea to buy myself a pregnancy pillow to simulate a body hugging me. I ordered it online and it’s supposed to arrive Wednesday. 
Im just wondering if anyone else has considered this idea? It sounds genius to me! I get cuddled withought having to have another person in my bed.  I hate sleeping alone so I’m pretty excited. Now I have to find a pillowcase to fit it!!",bipolar-disorder
Advice on who to handle a loved one’s episodes,"Hi! I just joined this group. I am looking for advice on how to handle and talk to a loved one who has been very erratic for the last 1.5 months. We had been going to therapy together to work on trust & communication issues and out of the blue 1.5 months ago he started accusing me of cheating on him, seeing messages that weren't real on my phone, hearing things that didn't happen. His mood swings are fast and erratic, one minute wanting to do 5 major things in a day the next unable to get out of bed all day and saying he wishes he could die. He fluctuates from being angry, verbally aggressive, to sad, to loving, back to angry etc etc multiple times in one day. He constantly says it's me, I have the problem, I am the problem, there is nothing wrong with him  etc etc. I don't know how to talk to him and address what is going on. I tell him I am extremely worried about him and that it might be good to get a basic health check up on vitamin levels etc. He is extremely paranoid of being brainwashed & poisoned as well as recently for the last few weeks expressing that he thinks I want to cause him physical harm. He can't sleep at night because he is consumed with nightmares about me trying to killing him or cheating on him. I talked to my therapist about all of this and her reply was that it sounded like he might have Bipolar I and was in a manic episode. I have been doing a lot of reading and it seems like he might have the rapid cycling. Since he now believes I have cheated on him and want to cause him physical harm, he has no trust with me and anything I say or suggestions I offer. I really worried about him and need advice on when & how to talk to him about what is going on, how do approach this? Thank you.",bipolar-disorder

Journaling for Self Awareness,"How many of you keep a journal of some sort?

I used to; I don't need it so much anymore, but journaling was an important part of my Journey for awhile, as I became self aware.  I

needed to keep one for Years, to be able to look back and see when I was manic, when I was depressed, whether I saw it coming, and how I behaved during those times.
I kept up with what meds I was taking When, and whether those meds seemed to make a difference in my mood swings.
I wrote about relationships and family dynamics too, so that I could remember what was likely due to the bipolar, and what was Not.
I found journaling Very helpful to show me that I needed to break patterns, try something new or sometimes to stick with what already Had been working, even if I couldn't remember clearly.
I know I couldn't always remember whether I had been behaving the same way in previous years, or during prior episodes, without a journal to look back in.

She made me realize that I first called 8/16 explaining I was stressed but didn't go into detail about abuse. She said that in itself shows the relationship was crumbling. The EAP lady said she is proud of me. She decided to give me 6 more free sessions. She knows I'm struggling financially and said she wants me to help she doesn't normally do this. It is such a blessing from God. I really feel the lord is with me. I'm counting my blessings. I'm still super happy about my $500 dollar discount at matress firm that man was so kind. I cried with both these people helping me. He wrote me a 22 page letter and addresses it to his address so that it would be forwarded to my new place. All it is is gaslighting. No one changes in 2 weeks. I moved 9/23, his letter says he is a changed man. Bull crap! I'm determined to heal. I realize different things each day about the reality of this situation. I started reading psychopath free. This book has been the most helpful because it wasn't until I read it that it focuses on recovery. You know whats crazy. In the 22 page letter he wrote he actually wrote I can't promise I won't kick or punch you in my sleep. I told you all before he is legit faking. Taking pillows over my body and punching seems calculated to me. I want to be single for 6 months. I want to be alone so until I'm done talking about abuse.

My body is crap, broken, diseased, crap, always has been...but my brain has somewhat always amazed me because it does really wierd things all the time.   Like right now as I'm tapering back on to my Anti-depressant for the ""winter season"" and dealing with the Manic-ness and my brain going at constant 200mph hamster wheel speed....it, beingmy brain knows that it only wants 2 hours of sleep per day.  And no matter what meds I take, or don't and what time I go to sleep, I wake up exactly 2 hours later, every night.   Probably not too wierd in itself, but I have a Cyclic Rhythm Sleep Disorder, blah, blah, blah, big words that mean my Internal Clock is broke.  So regularly I don't sleep more than 4.5 hours per night and I don't use an alarm, because my brain only sleeps 4.5 hours per night and wakes up exactly 4.5 hours after I go to sleep, every morning....like...well clockwork.
22 hour days are productive, but mentally exhausting.  That's another weird thing....my body/brain have shifted over the years in Mania symptoms.  As my body has broken down and is not able to run around and do things....the Manic-ness is more concentrated to Mental absurdity.   I have to stop what I'm doing at work every 45 mintues or so and forcibly re-center myself because I realize I've started doing 5 different things and finished nothing.   It's like when you close your eyes real tight and in the darkness behind them you see many bright lights.  That's how my brain feels right now, it wants to go and do something for each of those bright lights.
Last night I broke 14 of my personal best Tap Tile speed records, finished a Grant Proposal, started a new Research Paper, watched a couple more eps of Greys Anatomy, answered a handfull of work emails and went to sleep at 5:30a.m. and my eyes popped open at 7:30a.m. ready to start the day all over again.  I'm not tired....my head just feels like it might spin around so fast it's going to go flying off at some point.....
I'm up to full dose every other day, so another week and this should all start to recede like the ocean tide...and my better half should feel comfortable enough to carry his ass back home and things get back to normal.   I don't like having people underfoot 24/7 when I'm feeling fine.....I really don't care for it when I'm having to mentally check myself everytime I speak or do something...
Happy Tuesday!!!",bipolar-disorder

Gastric meds making Bipolar worse?,"I've not been in great shape for several months now. I'm due to see my psychiatrist on 17th Oct.
I've been getting huge waves of anxiety for no reason and for me that means it's dysphoria or whatever it's called - the BP2 equivalent of mixed state, a kind of agittated depression.
I've been taking small does of seroquel at night to try and knock it back but basically it's getting worse..

so long preambel - I started taking rabeprazole which is also known as Pariet on Friday..it's a med for acid reflux / GERD / ulcers..it's a PPI

Update/Question,"Hi!!
I made a post about a month ago talking about my struggle with going to high school and wondering if I should do online. I had a breaking point where I got so overwhelmed with school I dissociated for two hours in the school parking lot and no one knew what was happening. Me and my mom decided in doing online for junior year. I'm going to try to keep a schedule once I start so that I don't fall behind, and my girlfriend is helping me keep up with how much I'm isolated and how much social time I get. I'm feeling much better already.
I have a question for my medicated friends: I'm on 300mg of lithium and 100mg. Anyone else take these? How do they work for you? What medications work for you? I'm female, 16, and with bipolar 2 (unofficially. my therapist gave me a diagnosis but my psychiatrist hasn't known me long enough yet).",bipolar-disorder

I need advise... PLEASE,"Hello friends
So school started for me half way through august (I'm a junior in high school) and I had a long phase- well long for me- of manic from then to now. Keep in mind I have bipolar 2 so it's never too bad, but depression is always way worse than mania.
Starting last week, depression hit hard. I had a realization that I actually may not be able to function like a normal human. I can't get up in the morning or show up to school on time. I have no interest during my classes. I can't get myself to do homework. I just feel completely defeated.
I went to my mom and had a whole breakdown about it. She suggested trying online school until we can get this figured out.
What do you guys think? I love my school truly it's great, and I'm smart enough to do well in my classes, but my mental health is making it so hard.",bipolar-disorder

Protecting myself w/o gun,"So now that I'm single and alone. I feel vulnerable. Its bananas because its been only 4 years I lived with him. I been on my own since. But I think I'm paranoid. I couldn't find my second taser at his house. So that is annoying. I don't do guns its too manly and I watch to much investigation ID (like 24/7) to know women end up in jail because of guns. So I have my pepper spray, mace gun, kuba kickz, I'm thinking of buying a buddy bar door jammer, I'm going to buy 2 window steel bars, I already have a big block of wood for patio. My apartment is tiny. I'm still in a good neighborhood. But I think about how his motto is to try to hurt people months done the road. I have so many recordings of him talking about killing people. How'd he do it and why. Him and his dad would talk about population control. To me it was just talk. I couldn't take him seriously. I have a recording of him saying "" I'll murder you if you eat my muffins"" I feel like he always tried to scare me. But his hateful nature is why he talks about shooting homosexuals, mentally retarded and homeless. I'm buying security because I'm 5'3 115 lbs now and I'm a huge believer in dreams. I dreamed he suffocated me and my dog with his body weight. He told me multiple times he could get away with murder. I feel like the police don't care because he is from an affluent neighborhood and when he bit me they said I needed to leave. Whatever, he is all talk that much I believe. I have so many recordings of him talking like this. ",bipolar-disorder
Bipolar??,"Hi I'm not sure if I have Bipolar or not, but seem to have a lot of the symtoms. I saw a psychiatrist recently but he said that he couldn't diagnose Bipolar straight away as it is something that needs to be observed over a period of time. However, I am not due to see him again as it was a one off assessment appointment. Instead he diagnosed me with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia).  He said I have depression and general anxiety too.
I feel like its more than that. I have episodes of hypomania that last a few days, followed by a 'neutral' period than an episode of depression. My doctor put me on Flueoxtine which made me very depressed for a few weeks, then suddenly I felt like I was on a high. I felt like the world had become really bright and colourful and that I could achieve anything. This felt really weird as the day before I was very depressed. I felt like i could achieve anthing and win the lottery. During these periods, I will apply for like 10 plus jobs a day even though I know deep down I'm not qualified to do them and my anxiety would never let me work in those type of jobs . I spend money on things when I know that I cannot afford it and I have a high amount of debt. I don't spend much, just more than what I should be. I justify it because I spend that money on my children not myself, however its still money that should be going on debts.
I have been getting paranoid too, like if someone looks at me I get the thought that they are plotting something against me and that they are evil. The past week I'm becomimg increasingly forgetful, and I can;t unscramble what people are saying. I can physically feel my worries and thoughts bouncing around in my skull, they make buzzing sounds. I try and grab hold of just one thought, but I can't because they are flying around too fast. This makes my head feel really heavy and busy.
Yesterday I heard a child giggling at my neighbors house, but my first thought was that it was a doll that had come alive like Chucky. I felt terrified but did eventually realise that the noise was just a real child . Today, I was putting petrol in my car when I heard a car's engine come on and I automatically thought someone else had gotten into my car and was going to drive off with my child in the back. Then I realised it was'nt my car at all, but someone else's. When I read a book earlier, I saw the words 'You are going to die'. Are they delusions or have I got psychosis? Or is it anxiety? Or Bipolar?
I don't see friends I have withdrawn from everyone apart from my family. I don't bathe nor do I take care of my appearance. My memory is terrible and I have to constantly remind myself of what I am doing and where I'm going. This is exhausting and frightening.

I officially left my abuser,"I went back a total of 5 times to get my stuff. I don't make a lot of money anymore. I unpacked everything. As I would go through stuff I would realize what was missing. First time I went back it was to get my Michel Kors winter coat he bought me. Plus all my peacoats. I'm from Chicago winter is coming. For crine out loud last winter we went a week straight with temperatures colder than Antarctica. Then I would come home thinking I'm done and I'm like omg I left the Samsung 3 tablet he bought me. Then I realized he had all my size 5 jeans. I'm like screw this I'm not buying more jeans with no money and limited money. I realized I left my mace gun my paper shredder. I just became infuriated and I got my stuff even dog food. Blue dog food is not cheap. I don't have a support system no family or friends. So it was not cool for him to keep stuff I needed being on a tight budget. My final trip was Thursday. I was lucky that my ex co worker that I hadn't seen in 2 years was willing to help me move the 23rd. She and her boyfriend helped me hang pictures, put together a chair, my current co worker put together my table. I got frustrated when I realized he had all the crosstitch pattern books I bought. I got it all. I know I'm stupid for going back 5 times. But I can sleep at night knowing. I have everything. I googled mace gun womanonguard.com its $70 I don't have 70 dollars to buy another. I got it. So what I left. I left lots of clothes a $700 7 seater glass dining table, $300 dollar mimic Michael Angelo painting, seashell painting, 500 dollar 3 peice african oil painting,, kitchen furniture, boat wall hanging picture, 400 dollar suede loveseat sofa, mail that might of snuck through and God knows what else. But he can have it. It pisses me off that I don't have a sofa in my place. He sent me over 400 texts, left a VM crying. He said he realized he loved me when I left. 4 years and now that I'm gone he realizes he loves me, he cried and said he was molested as a child and that because I'm the only person he has ever told that means he loves me. He said he never told anyone until now. He said his defenses were always up and now that He told me he molested his defenses are down he can be his true self. I said I've lived with  you 4 years this is who you are. He says no its not I've just been insecure and defensive now that you know I was molested you know my deepest darkest secrets all my defenses are down now. I say so I'm supposed to believe that since I moved out 9/23 your different. He says ""YES"" This man is an idiot. I say ""You know that I was abused as a child and your trying to use your abuse as a ploy to get me to stay to feel sorry for you. Your disgusting! He says I know I worked late and id come home and take it out on you. I'm sorry. I didn't spit on you I sneezed, I don't remember spitting on you, I never spit on you, I never intentionally took a pillow and punched you. How dare you demonize me in that letter. What are you telling your therapist about me or your coworker? I don't know whose in your head. How dare you penalize me for my sleep issues. When we first started dating I told you I punched my ex for waking me up it was an accident my mom even told you I'd done it to her. I said your faking it and I'm calling you out now and then anytime I've disturbed you in your sleep you've elbowed me repeatedly in my side, you've grabbed my face with your full hand, you've grabbed my head and pushed it in the mattress and vibrated your hand in frustration because I stirred you in your sleep, taking pillows over my body and punching me. Your not sleeping your an animal. You claim not to remember each time I confront. He says your demonizing me your a demon your a narsscistic woman! I can't help what I do in my sleep, I love you so much, I never realized how much I loved you until you started pulling away, lets go to therapy, lets go to church, I went to church for the first time and prayed for the first time. I need you it can't end like this. I never went in the toilet and put a piece of shit on you it was peanut butter. I was just joking. I never did those things but if you think it happened I'll own it. I'm sorry. Sometimes it takes losing someone to realize the love I have for you. When I said your hair looked like my pubes i was just joking, your hair is beatiful, I never said i own you. I didn't slap you you were manic you were hallucinating Blah blah blah, this man can rot in hell he can burn in hell, go straight to hell, some days I cry, somedays I'm surprised I'm not crying, sometimes it feels like I've been punched in my heart. I'm giving myself 6 months to be single. I'm so disgusted. The only thing bad that he could say is that i didn't clean enough. That I went through med changes on occasion. That's all he could say. ",bipolar-disorder
I'm falling into a Mania and hyper fixation?,"This week has been a whirlwind! I've been rapid cycling like crazy! Right now my heart is racing. I also think I'm hyper fixating on the relationships in my life, especially potentially new relationships. 
SOOOOO here's the deal! There's this GUY, he's in one of my classes and we're about the same age (something we joke about). I want to ask him out, but I think I'm going to wait till the end of the class because he's not in my major and we probably won't see each other again.
I'm not here to ask for dating advice! So don't worry all!
I just feel like this new interest (infatuation) is a side effect of my developing mania. It's hard to tell which is which. It's super frustrating to not know. I also think that I'm reading too much into his level of interest, he's cordial and nice but not over the top (like any normal acquaintance). I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to keep this mania under control and do something I regret. Something like revealing my interest too soon and making the rest of the class awkward if he doesn't reciprocate. 
(Side note: I'm feeling really good about myself, like my personality and appearance, and that is giving me an unhealthy level of confidence (enlarged ego) which is also why I think that this new infatuation is a side effect of a newly developing mania) 
I've been avoiding caffeinated beverages to try to combat this with some meditation and herbal teas (chamomile). I have also reached out to my TDOC for advice but I'm interested in what the community thinks! 
I've also been running on all cylinders as of late (leaving the house at 6:30a and coming home at 9p) coming and going to and from school. So I've canceled an outing with friends tomorrow in order to sleep in, as an attempt to calm down.

Admitted to the Hospital for Mania,"This is a post from this current mania that is breaking today.  I went four days without sleep and everything was starting to break down.  This post is in response to someone else on the board as I thought it might be interesting for you.
I went into the hospital.  The doctor first said he could give drugs to keep me out, but I haven't seen those work for sleep or mania control.  I drove over to the hospital and went to the ER and told them to admit me.  My doc already called ahead so I was admitted directly to the Psych Ward.  This ward was not military and so very very different.  It is was noisy and chaotic, many other patients had very aggressive issues, or were full psychotic (the one lady walking up and down the halls yelling like she is on a cell phone with someone).  I had a private room, which is good for my PTSD.  Well, I was in for Mania.  I had not slept for four days when I arrived.  The first night they fully sedated me... which didn't work.  I was up the entire night.  Next, the morning, I met with my Doc when he was doing rounds and roughed him up a bit.  I think it was the hospital gown getting the best of me, but he put in an order, and about 1000, they came in the room to give me the drug.  Now let's just say them - 3 burly male nurses, one petite female nurse with two syringes.  I roll up my sleeve and then is when the nurses push me over and yank down the pants.  It seems to Thorazine (400 mg via IM) only goes in the butt.  I think there were only drugs involved, but they weren't in an explaining mood even when asked.  I was not acting out.  But three of them held my arms, legs, and back.  Staying still for the shot was rather easy.  I needed to sleep.  At five days, I hit my limit.  The shot took well over 90 minutes for me to get to sleep.  So I work up around 6 pm or so. I hung out with my fellow nuts until it was shot time.  Same procedure.  I should have farted in defense.   This time, I fell asleep immediately.  They might have upped the dosage and I will check when I get the records.
So I went into the hospital to be sedated.  I didn't need anything else.  I wonder if I will need to do this every time now.  This is my 7th Mania in 12 months.  I have no idea what that means, but all I know is that these manias are terrible.  I do not know what I will do, or say, or spend money, or what I will do with my car or to myself.  I also arrived very suicidal.  I told the intake nurse, and they didn't do too much.  I still have the knife right here on my desk.  I can feel the sharpness and think about it all.
:ocked for three days.  Yeah, my third.  Now I have a total of 31 days in a mental ward.

Yayyyy !!!! and Oops !!,"First: They were able to remove all the cancer yesterday. I won't need any additional treatment. I did get a partial facelift. The resulting hole in my face was rather large. The plastic surgeon restored things nicely. Now my left is my good side. Lol
Second: I'm an endangered species. That meaning I'm a Florida native. This morning I discovered while walking that someone had uprooted numerous small mangrove plants. I knew they were protected. I replanted all but two of what I had discovered. Those two were mown over and pretty much beyond salvaging. I expressed concern to the City here where I live. Their arborist was a bit more upset than I was. According to him and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Each plant destroyed or damaged carries a $5000 fine and possible other penalties. Now he's launching a formal investigation that will include folk from the Florida DEP. Yikes !!!! 
I just wanted a little help in educating the folks here in the park about the importance of Florida's protected native species. Instead I may of stirred up a hornet's nest. Oh well !!! 
Still I feel good for replanting the little trees I could. I hope they get to grow to be full size mangrove trees. ",bipolar-disorder

Vocational Rehab,"So, vocational rehab (here in the U.S.) is something many people with disabilities utilize when trying to go back to work.  And apparently the program varies Widely, from State to state.
When I was in South Carolina and first started with voc rehab, I was in an area that was predominately geared to factory work, so in addition to showing up for classes and doing remedial math, I was ""put to practice work"" every day, putting styrofoam peanuts in barrels as fast as I could. (Not a good fit for me, but it was for others!)
In Washington state, when I signed up for voc rehab, I had Very nice people to work with...they helped me create a resume and bought interview clothes for me.   
 Here in Kentucky, I have had the Most intensive program - and in my opinion, the MOST helpful.  They have prepped me for 6 weeks, meeting with me at home to learn about me, my goals,strengths and weaknesses. ..took me around to different places so I could Think about whether I could realistically work there...helped me with a new resume, helped me with interviews, and much more.
If you are on disability or between jobs Because of your disability, your  state's vocational rehab program may be quite helpful in holding your hand through the process and helping you go back to work.
Just thought I'd pass that along, in case there are those of you who are considering going back to work.",bipolar-disorder
Long term drift,"I'm having problems at the moment. I always have them at this time of year.
But this year is worse and so I'm going to see my psychiatrist hopefully soon. I've not seen him for a proper consultation for about 5 years.
I've used one of those online moodtrackers and because it keeps going offline I decided to print off the 10 years (!) I've been tracking my moods.
It's made me realise I have a long term drift - I used to only get problems really in the late summer or autumn. Then some problems appeared in the spring and I put that down to work stuff at that time of year. Now I'm retired and it's worse. I get a long depressive period. Late summer and autumn it goes into an agitated depression.
It now looks as if 6 months is being eaten up. I didn't realise.
Anyone else experienced similar? I'll be 60 this year, you would think things would have quietened down by now.

Jonesing,"I am out of cigarettes. I have no money. I already got a pack from my mom and one from my sister this week. I won’t ask them for another pack. I don’t even as them, they just knew I was out of cigs and they bought me some. I did appreciate that. 
Mai I am out of cigs probably till Thursday. I need advice on how to make it till then. I see a new dr on Monday and I’m gonna ask for a patch or gum or something. ",bipolar-disorder

He calls crying,So my little apartment is coming together. He has texted me and I respond. He called crying. Not once asked where I went. He is more concerned about how I have made him feel and he said I am demonizing him and painting him as a bad person. He feels that since he has so much money and paid for a lot and spoiled me with the best. That he's such an amazing man. He gave examples of giving me 4000 on my car. But I explained money does not by love. I don't care about any of the extravagance. I'm done. He cried and cried and said that he didn't spit it was a joke. He keeps saying its a joke and I need to get his since of humor. He said I buy you jewlery and trips why would I spit on you. I'm going to meditate and focus not answering these texts or calls. I just refuse to listen to him tell me he was joking.,bipolar-disorder
Bullies,"SO my seconfd nephew is 12 years old. Yesterday in school, this kid who has been bullying him for several years picked my nephew up and threw him on the ground. So my nephew gets up and tosses this kid on th efloor and punches the kid in the face.
I found this out cause i called my younger sister and she mentioned Josh is over helping clean her house and my older sister, Josh's mom, thought a good ""punishment"" would be to help my other sister clean.
My first thought was, ""Way to go Josh!"" And I told him so. But Josh is suspended for several dayas and his mom is pretty steamed. His Dad is cool with it cause Josh was only standing up for himself. I told him way to go and if anyone ever hits him to hit them ten times as hard. I as a bullied child and very small and weak and unable to defend myself.
Anyway, I know bullying is a big isssue nowaadays but am I wrong to be proud of the kid for defending himself? Teacher intervention doesnt do anything and kids need to learn to stand up for themselves. Just saying.",bipolar-disorder

Did poorly on a test,"I didn't do as well on a test as I would have liked. I'm feeling a huge mix of emotions but mostly anger. I was surprised at how angry I was. There was some sadness but I was just angry and frustrated. This is supposed to be an easy class. I can't help but wonder if its me. I studied for it all week and I still didn't get the grade I wanted. It just makes me want to quit school and hide. I'm trying so hard and I just feel so dumb. and I know I'm not smart but I should be able to handle a class of this level.

Parts talk III :-D,"
Here I sit. Encouraged by a friend to once again write of a journey inside to see who is about using parts work... or talking to the little people inside me. My inner family. One of they keys is to listen for the part to answer and not get busy guessing and thinking what it might say.

So I ask myself who is about that's willing to talk to me and my friends and then wait.

Back comes a quiet “me”. I find that voice in or around my body. In between the eyebrows right between the eyes. I focus my attention there on it and ask it what it wants me to know?

“I want you to know you are loved” it says. “I want you to learn how to counter those voices that hurt your confidence and self-esteem. You know who I mean. The name-callers and distracting parts that make you lose your focus.”



“Tell me more” I ask.



“I'll tell you enough to get started. That will do for now. Every thought is an expression of a part. You are the awareness, the body and life force that the thoughts occur within. Remember thoughts are a piece of knowledge either right or wrong... plus the charges of emotion we feel, large or small. So, when a part has a thought here is something that works to make you notice the part rather than identify with it or against it. Add on '...says a part' or '...feels a part' out loud and try to locate it in or around your body. That's it. That's the first step to getting started. Noticing parts. Do it after every thought for a little bit and you will begin observing thoughts rather than having them.”


“All you are doing is stopping yourself identifying with thoughts and emotions, that's nothing”, says another part trying to belittle the insight expressed. This part is opposed, or “polarised” with the first part. I locate it... a slight pressure behind my right eye... and I thank it for it's contribution (not sarcastically either) but ask it “Can you soften so I can get to know the first part better?” I feel it give me room reluctantly so I let it know that if it needs attention I can stop doing what I am doing and focus on it instead. Offering compassionate help for it's concerns. It says “I don't want that”. I know it is secretly thinking “That might be nice” but don't push.


I refocus again at the spot between my eyes and ask “What else do you want me to know?” Back comes “I want you to know that the relaxed, knowing presence that you experience most easily in the stillness of little or no thoughts is your essence, your true or core Self. A broader intelligence.”


Here is a quote by Oprah's favourite guru that the part said to finish with...


“The beginning of freedom is the realisation that you are not “the thinker.” The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realise that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. You also realise that all the things that truly matter – beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace – arise from beyond the mind. You begin to awaken.”


-Eckhart Tolle

I check if either part needs any more from me at the moment. “No”, say the parts... and appreciative of the attention, feel the parts.

Forcing myself to look in the mirror.,After feeling like I had to force myself to look in the mirror I am truly upset with what I see looking back at me. The first thing I noticed was how disconnected I am worse than that realizing how long I've been disconnected. Then I looked at my eyes and saw tremendous pain. All I have been able to do since is wonder why I allowed so much pain in my life. I am so mad at myself for not standing up for me. I'm not sure how I feel about anything right now. But I do know I have to move forward and I pray I picked the right path to go down. I've been at a crossroad for so long praying for a sign to show me what path to take. I feel so alone but maybe I want it like that.,bipolar-disorder

I just need someone that understands,"It’s a long story, but in my most recent manic episode, I hurt the man I was with. Not physically, but emotionally. I’ve always had these mood cycles. I’d feel a disconnect and I’d look around at everyone like they were almost strangers. It was a numbness. My kids, my boyfriend, I’d be looking at them and know I love them, but it was like I couldn’t actually feel it. Like I was trapped. Then, this almost panic would start, like I needed to DO something. I’d get little sleep, I’d feel crazy, like doing something crazy. I’d end up with this “don’t care” feeling and start making reckless decisions. My boyfriend noticed a change, but I knew it wasn’t him, I just couldn’t explain it. At first I started feeling depressed and the more he pressed me and thought it was him, the more I felt cornered. I would feel better for a minute and get through to him that it wasn’t him, then he’d be right back at it. He noticed I was distant, accused me of being interested in someone else, everyone else around. I never was. He started accusing me of being interested in his family members, accusing me of flirting with everyone that was ever around. I started going through a manic phase and he wouldn’t stop. Instead of being myself and being able to comfort him and ease his insecurities, I had this attitude about me and I couldn’t understand what I was going through. I couldn’t make sense of my thoughts, feelings, I felt depressed but on top of the world and I bought a ticket to a concert I didn’t want to go to, spent a lot of money, started having an attitude at work, and after being accused enough, I spent a few days messaging my boyfriend’s cousin that I would never ever be interested in. Nothing crazy, but enough to hurt. I stopped talking to him all together. Nothing “dirty” was ever exchanged and we never meant anywhere. It was mostly small talk. I confessed to it. I crashed. I got so depressed I didn’t want to live anymore. I begged for another chance, upon a lot of contingencies. I go seek help, which I did. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I and PTSD from childhood trauma that was never dealt with and put on medication. I spent weeks having horrible panic attacks, one very public one in front of all my coworkers. I lost my job. Most days I can barely get out of bed. He’s “tried” for 2.5 months to get over it, and I haven’t even asked him to, or for forgiveness, or tried to rush him. I’ve only ever asked for a chance to show that I really do love him and I never wanted someone else, and I’m not leaving. I just got sick...but knowing about it and being on my medication, I feel level to low. I don’t have the energy to be manic. I spend all my time depressed and terrified of losing the person I love the most, all for something I can’t change. I don’t know what to do. It’s bad enough that I am starting to have a hard time even taking my kids to school. I don’t want to be by myself. I feel like no one can love me, and all I’ve ever done is be a poison and a problem to the people I love. I hurt them, and I hurt myself. I don’t have anyone that understands at all. My therapist helps, but I dread the 45 minute mark when it’s all over.",bipolar-disorder
Where to turn,"i feel so alone lately. When I really think about it I am alone. I’m on a downward spiral and need just someone. I wish I was better at being alone don’t get me wrong i don’t mind being alone but not feeling like this. i have a friend who also is bipolar and she always tells me she can be in a room full of people and feel so alone. So I mentioned that to her tonight and asked what she does when she feels that way and she told me that for so long she always looked outward to fill her up inward and only until she could fill herself inward did she not feel so alone.  She says being lonely is just a state of mind. I’m not sure about that I do feel like I have pulled back on friendships since losing my friend and others to many to count. Maybe that is why I feel so alone.
Does anyone else ever feel very alone and what do you do about it...what helps you.  I’m just scared. Thanks  ",bipolar-disorder
Today is worse,"Today is worse. I shared the story of my last manic episode yesterday and the trouble it’s caused in my relationship. I think I’ve lost him. He had a screenshot of some messages he and I exchanged 2 years ago when we first met, when I was just going through my divorce. I was also manic then. I said a lot of things, about how I didn’t care if my ex got with someone new, I was done, I’ll just go get laid, doesn’t matter to me. I was married from 19 to 26. I had 3 crazy weeks where I slept with someone for the first time in my life I wasn’t “with”. Then I went through a major depressive episode and it disgusted me so much what I had done, that was when I first went to therapy. But it didn’t help. She didn’t listen very well. I ended up getting through that one on my own, with the help of my boyfriend that I am now afraid I’ve lost. I thought I improved this time...I didn’t actually go that far and I wouldn’t have. Even in my mania, with my PTSD, I couldn’t let someone else touch me. I have an aversion to touching anyway. I don’t know what to do. I can’t handle anymore loss. I can’t handle anymore stress when I’m newly in treatment, have nowhere to turn. It’s been such a hard few years. A divorce, a custody battle, losing this relationship where for the first time in my life I felt loved and “home”. I’m fighting such feelings of abandonment that I don’t even want to let my kids go to school. I want to hold onto anything I can hold onto.
But I am alone...truly, alone.",bipolar-disorder

I left off doing the room since summer and I'm back again...mainly just posting what I want to accomplish in a day....it's good to have a running record for those days when I'm flat on my face and Nothing gets done...my 'worm hole days'.

This summer has been a continuum of worm holes from identity theft, to tick bite that landed me in hospital, kidney failure, and temp of 103.7 for 9 days. Then dear son got pneumonia in one lung, was home with me, I was taking care of him only 2weeks out of hospital, brought him back home, next day I had to take him to er. He has three blood clots, groin to calf in each leg, one in lung, then the other lung pneumonia. He is only 23, his dx according to dr's is from sitting down, laying down, not moving period and being overweight.

Dancing to the tunes of BP, Organized Pandemonium and Conflamadrama~~~ hope you'll swing by and post or just come and lurk...

Whatever floats your boat and doesn't sink your ship....me on dry land until next spring :)

“Nudge”,"In hopes to eventually make Doodles my service dog, I am working on “nudge”. Right now I hold a treat in my closed fist and as he nudges and licks my hand to get the treat, I tell him “nudge”. Once he nudged on command without the treat, I will add the conditioned stimulus, a “shh” and tell him “nudge”. The end goal is that when I go “shh” he will automatically nudge me and bring me back from whatever intrusive thought I am having. He is a fast learner. When he learns that I will start taking him out in public such as the mall and teach him to stand directly behind me in a crowd or line. I am dead serious about making him a service dog. He is incredibly smart and obedient but adding public training is essential for him to learn to work in a distracted environment. I feel pretty good about this ",bipolar-disorder

He began to cry saying he loves me he was going to propose one day in wyoming. How could I throw 4 years away. He said your thr one with the issues you and your med changes, i said don't pull that knowing your mom is schizophrenic. I typed him an  8 pg letter describing his physical and mental abuse and left it wherw he wpuld find it. He changed his locks. I went back 2 timed to get more stuff. I forgot my red peacoat. This GPS was a disaster. I feel like because I never had black eyes this isn't domestic violence. At most he slapped me only once, bit me once, spit on me once, he pinches me, he grabs my arm it leaves finger bruises but its words mostly.

Join the Military Again?,"dSomeone asked this and I wanted to post a response here.  First, yes.  I joined at 17 and finally got out at 50.  I worked for something greater than myself; I was part of a team that had at its core intentions was to do good.  Perfect execution, no.  Everyone in uniform an angel, no.  I made 11 deployments all from 8 to 14 months long.  That is a lot of time away from my family.  I moved dozens of times and own nearly a dozen houses.  In the house that I own now, was the very first time I was at the closing.  My wife has been a rock in my life. 
Yes, I have been around weapons.  I worked with the teams and supported them in the field.  I have led teams that have worked all around the planet.  I have been shot at a number of times.  Most of these were while delivering humanitarian aid to villages in the jungles of southeast Asia.  The largest single humanitarian air delivery organization is the US Military.  For me as a logistician, I have worked extensively to deliver aid all over the planet.  
Medical care, well you kinda of get what you pay for on that front.  I never really entered the medical field until I was extremely sick at the end of my career.  It was all free but access was limited.  My care in the OR, ICU, and ER was not up to civilian standards and I ended up with trauma from those experiences and I have trouble dealing with doctors and nurses.
On balance, I would do it again.  Not perfect by any means, and there are many bad people in the service and the service has made a number of errors.  But the balance is positive and overall it was a positive experience.    ",bipolar-disorder

Bound Hand and Foot,"I have a question.  When I was transferred from one hospital (civilian) to the military mental hospital, I was transported like this.  The wife took the pix for evidence of what was going on as we were having a hard time getting info out of the docs and the nurses kept lying to us about my condition and care.  Come to find out that once they think you are suicidal they are under zero obligation to tell you or your family about what is going on, where you are going and what your condition is.  You also lose all privacy as any meeting with the doctor was helping with open doors and many nurses in the room that wanted to see the ""show"".  But back to the pix, is this normal to be bound while in transport?  I was not acting out, I was too scared at this point because I could be court marshal for a suicide attempt, and was not violent.  I just remember this ride and being tied down and no one telling me why.  I only overheard where I was going like no one else told me.
So is this normal?  Has anyone else experienced this?
After I got to the new ward and went through their intake procedures (extremely humiliating) I could not call my wife till later the next day.  I feel like such a failure that I got myself into a situation that this was done to me and that I no longer had any freedom.  ",bipolar-disorder

DBT,"Since I've been gone (from DS), I have taken a (much-needed) class in Dialectical Behavioral Training. DBT
I got a lot out of it; I had thought I would.  The biggest thing I came away with was a base premise: whever I have a thought, I can Notice the thought, decide if it's worth paying attention to, then have the opportunity to let it just pass on by.
In class, we were applying it to my anxiety triggers, but I see it can apply to Many areas of life.
If I have thoughts about all the things that could go wrong with my day?  Notice the thoughts, then just let them pass on by, and let my mind think of something Else.  The Next thought.
If I have a thought that I don't like what someone said?  Notice the thought, decide if it's important to think about or talk about, then let the thought pass on by.
The space in my head that is Noticing the thought, is the most important one for me.  Because often I react to things without noticing my thoughts.  Or I let a thought keep going in my head, when it Shouldn't.
What if the bus gets in a wreck while I am on it?  What if the elevator gets stuck while I am in it?  What if I wake up tomorrow with a panic attack or a heart attack?  What if that person doesn't like me?   And on, and on...so now I have the option to Notice the thought, and move On.

It's like they talk about - living In The Now.  Whatever intrusive thought I am having, is just That - a Thought.  And I can let it go by, and think the Next thought.
When I want another cookie?  Or a drink? or, to cut? It's just a thought; notice it, and let it pass by.

Now that's Not Easy.  If it were, we'd all be perfect!  Sometimes the intrusive thought will keep coming Back, and we have to repeat the procedure over and over again.
But DBT has given me a new baseline to keep coming back to, with daily practice.  And I'm Better for it.
Just thought I'd share today; it's worth mentioning.",bipolar-disorder

Learning as I go,"i was and still am very very depressed probably the worst it has ever been.  I guess I can say memories and reality got the best of me. Just a very difficult time in my life. I will explain a little I am a RN and loved it with all my heart. One day I was on the floor and went psychotic I lost it. Anyways make a long story short with help of my best friend that has since passed on I got back on my feet.  Since her death lots of things have been going on...first I had twin boys. They are perfect in every way even if they weren’t I would love them the same.

I was let go of my position at the hospital they offered me a different position not a hands on with patients. I told them to shove it. It was probably just as well even though I didn’t think so at the time. I still have a hard time trusting my brain. Anyways I don’t live far away from my friend who died husband and he has played a huge roll in my life. I work on his ranch and my twins love him to death. Just let you know I do not know who the father is. I have lead a crazy life and by doing so my mother who is very religious pretty much washed her hands of me.  I did get married to a man years ago seems like a lifetime ago.  I should of never married. He was mentally ill and ended up committing suicide and made sure I would find him which I did along with my friend. We were gasoline and fire. My father passed on and he threw my fathers ashes in my face. That was the final straw funny I never left for me but left because of my father and his ashes.  

Anyways my friends husband had to take off to just take time by himself I guess, He is back east somewhere him and his dog. Anyways I could go on and on. What I wanted to write was it is so weird how things work in life some thing have no explanation. I wrote last night or maybe early this morning how I was having a rough time and how my pdoc really doesn’t know me and I got some great replies to think about. This morning my Dr calls and say she wants to see me sooner than my appointment. So when I got there I asked how she knew I was having a hard time. She just said if I wasn’t having a hard time than she really would worry about me and she knew I was trying to put on a fake persona when I saw her. Actually I do that a lot. When I try to think about why I do this I always come back to my mom and the crap she told me and how ashamed she is of me and I’m a big embarrassment and nothing but a damn nightmare, I was close to my father but since he passed my mom and I have not talked at all. I have tried but she wants nothing to do with me so a group of us have made a family. No we aren’t family but we would do anything for each other that is why it is so hard to watch my friends husband having such a hard time since she died. Also a side note he lost his leg so dealing with that has been rough. Anyways I miss him big time and my babies miss him also I just hope he finds the answers he is looking for. If my kids and myself are not in picture that is ok as long as he is happy because he is definitely one person that deserves all the love the world has to offer. When I miss him so much I remember the saying if you love him set him free..blah blah blah.

"Hello again, after a long time","Hi, it's Mary Anne :).  I've named myself GTTM (goingthruthemotions) but still me...
Many of you won't know me, some will.  I first joined in 2006 and have been off and on here since then.  Back then, I was a Mess!
I've spent a lifetime being actively bipolar...have had over 60 jobs and over 30 residences...4+ husbands and countless boyfriends...that's not something to be proud of.
In 2013, after 2 years of paperwork, I received disability.  In 2014, I moved out on my own (again). 
At that point, I had my last manic Hoo-ra.  3 months after getting my new apartment, I experienced angels and aliens who moved in with me and worked to straighten me out.  You can take that Any Way You Want...we're all bipolar, here.
It worked...I have been stable since then, so we're going on 5 years now.  Pretty good record, Especially for me...before then, I could not make it 6 months ""stable"".
The angels told me about One more man I would meet, who would be with me to the end of this life.  Sure enough, I met him just a few weeks later.
He is my opposite, my complement, my ROCK.  We have been together since 2015.
I do take zyprexa, which is an anti-psychotic.  It makes me dull and boring, but I don't have anxiety attacks any more (knock on wood).  I take it Every Day.  I don't miss, even when I don't like being boring and flat.
We now live in a little house that we own, in a nice, quiet, boring neighborhood...and, after nearly 9 years of not working, I am actually going back to work!  Part time.
I'm OLD now.  54.  Maybe not old and infirm, but I've started to contemplate my own mortality.  It happens.
This is ME, now.  Boring and predictable and STABLE.   It Is possible.  It Can happen.   Even for the most unstable of us, growth and change is possible.

So, hello again - I'd like to hang out some, get to know you, and be part of the community again.

It's not MY anxiety,"SO i wasn to hear your thoughts on this. When I first started therapy with my very first therapist, she said I need to own my illnesses. They do not define me but they are part of me.
A while ago i was talking to my therapist about ""my"" anxiety. She challenged me not to think of it as ""my"" anxiety, but as ""the symptoms of my anxiety"". She wants me to distance myself from it and look at it as symptoms and not really a part of me. Now I have a hard time accepting this view because for the last six years I have been thinking about it as ""my anxiety"", and ""my bipolar"". But I see what she is getting at. If i separate my symptoms from who I am, they have less power over me.
So, I am curious as to what your thoughts are on this and how do you feel about putting your symptoms as apart from who you are?",bipolar-disorder
It’s too much,So my parents and I we’re just eating dinner in the living room. One of our big dogs is food aggressive and growled at my puppy and the puppy just lunged and grabbed Kota by the face. Dad jumped over and grabbed the pup by the harness while I grab Kotas  collar and try to pry the pups jaw open. Mom is freaking out and runs from the room.  It took over a minute before the pup let go of Kota. Dad took the pup to his crate and mom got me a wet rag to stop Kotas lip from bleeding. He wasn’t bleeding bad but enough. This is it. I don’t want to keep the pup. It is too much on me to deal with having to keep all of our animals separated and the pup is only gonna get bigger and stronger and I fear the aggression will get worse not better even with training.

Feeling Overwhelmed,"I've just been feeling overwhelmed by the amount of school work I have. I get frustrated because these classes are not even that difficult, I'm just not the best student. :( I'm trying hard to overcome these challenges but sometimes I just want to shut down and take a nap. I was almost in tears on the train home because of all the homework I have to do. I don't even know how to ask questions in my classes and I'm afraid of sounding dumb. I'm taking on so much debt to go to school that dropping out isn't an option. I want to make something of myself self but it sometimes doesn't seem to be working. If I talk to my parents about it they freak out and repeat the same annoying phrases and we fight. I've just had a very difficult day.   ",bipolar-disorder
Helping Someone,"I am a heart patient and have been very active on a support message board for my type of disease.  I have been very vocal as a patient advocate, because I was so screwed over by the military, and I have attracted others coming to the board looking for patient experiences.  I have helped out five groups of doctors so far and just finished up a project this morning for another doctor working for their Ph.D.  I like the work, and it often reveals more about my experiences than I give out.  I always make the point that doctors that see patients need to view them as a system of systems and mental health are a huge driver.  I was depressed, anxious for about 18 months before my body started to fail.  Then when it did nearly every single system failed at the same time.  I broke my heart, sleep, migraines, skin, shoulders, body tremors, and my digestion.  I received far more medical care than I needed.  What I needed was a good therapist.   I added it up, in the twelve months after my heart started to fail, I had over 50 medical appts with was issued nearly 100 different drugs.  No one looked at me as a system but only looked at their small piece and ignored the rest. 
I asked for an internist to follow my case because I knew what they were doing was not working.  The internist turned me into my work (yes, she called my bosses boss), my shrink and TDoc.  She told me to report directly to my PDoc.  I arrived in mania to the doctor, and I think I got a bit out of control.  The internist clinic refused to see me after that.  I was nearly begging for someone to look at me as well me, and not a collection of parts to be repaired.  Each doctor had their program, and it didn't matter that overall, the patient got worse.

Listening to my head,for me what my head is telling me and what I appear to be is two different things. Make sense probably not. I am just miserable inside and don’t know how to get me back I am so ashamed of how I feel. i shouldn’t  feel like I do . I go to my Drs and pretend I’m doing well or better. The whole appointment I’m trying not to break down and cry. I miss my best friend who died more than I can ever write about and now her husband took off traveling the US with his dog. How do you start being honest with people and let them know how you really are doing. My pdoc tells me how proud she is of me how well I’m doing. She is so wrong I’m not ok and far from someone to be proud of just more shame. i think the only person who knows what is inside is my mother and she doesn’t want anything to do with me. I have no communication at all and has been this way for years. Maybe she has been right about me. I’m just alone and I know it is all my doing. I need to get to work have a good day everyone I will be ok I always am. ,bipolar-disorder
The great big introduction thread,"I've just asked another new member to do an introduction post and it occured to me that for the new comers they might want to know about the other people on the board.
So I thought - maybe have an introduction thread that we all contribute to? Something we keep going?

So, I'll go first.

I'm Mark, 58, living in England. Married with two adult stepsons who live with us.
I arrived on DS in 2007, shortly before getting my diagnosis of bipolar. I guess I'm bipolar 2 although I have experienced a short spell of mixed state. In 2011 ish they added Austism Spectrum Disorder to my diagnosis.
I was put on lithium for a while and then put onto lamotrigine and seroquel. I now only take the seroquel when I need it. The autism thing means I'm sensitive to meds which has been a real issue in the past but it does mean I only need to take small doses to remain stable(ish).
I've been a community leader here for 9 years. My wife is on DS as Cliffskat, Community Leader for Widows & Widowers - we met on DS as we had both lost our spouses.
I'm now retired, although I have a scientific background I ended up in corporate consulting for most of my career.
Hobbywise I produce my own music, some of which has been used on BBC programmes. I have a garden and grow a bunch of plants. I'm interested in nature, mainly plants and insects.

I may add some stuff later but ..how about you?

Now his kindness and fortitude are being repaid. I cry the happiest of tears while writing this. His transplant surgery is in the second week of October.

This versus me! What is it? Anybody??,"Pretty long buttt good read very interesting (imo) and i would love some input please. 
It begins..
So, uno(1/one) months since i have seen my pdoc and i have gained 10 pounds. It is not my medicines 100%. But i do have a theory. We thought maybe i have ocd. Does anyone have this? If so, what is your experience? What sort of things do you obsess or compulse over? 
Now, where the connection between ocd and weight gain come in. When i do something, or like something, or whatever, i absolutely obsess over it. Not to the point i think about it all day everyday but like... (Ive sort of talked about this before) if i like tiedye, ill have to buy like 5 shirts, 2 pairs of pants and a dress. If i like my hair, i dye it, cut it, do it everyday, straight curly, and buy lots of products for it. If i like watermelon sour patches, i eat them for two months straight everyday. If i drink(which i do not but def had the problem before) then i drink till im drunk three four times a week. Lotion, i told my husband i dont use it or else i haveto put it on three times a day, face Lotion, feet lotion, elbow, legs, arms, ect. 
Then, if i see something on a website such as large hairclips are in. I love them, i haveto buy them NOW(that one kinda sounds like compulsive buying haha). 
What is this? Is it ocd? Im going f_in looney. I legit been obsessed with sour patch icecream, i gained 10 pounds in a month eating it. If it is, i cant even take anything as ocd is taken care of with antidepressants which do not mix with bipolar. Im sooo lost and confused and feel like absolutely noone understands. Please, any questions, comments, experiences, knowledge, even jokes are welcome lol(in good taste please). ",bipolar-disorder

Is 2019 the year for me?,"I've been having a great year so far. Not in a manic way, in a very even way. I've had my ups and downs but I think they haven't been as extreme as they used to be. School is just starting so it is difficult to get a grasp on how I am doing, but I think it is going well.
I think the main thing I am doing is completing my ""to- do"" lists. I bought a cute little journal for them and it even helps me keep track of my water intake. 
I've had a few spats with family but it's nothing too intense. I think that has to do with the fact that my sister moved out after she got married. 
I have a new job teaching kids how to make little robots for an after school program that is affiliated with my university. So that means that I have a little more money so things don't feel as pinched. 
And I've noticed an increase in friends (mostly acquaintances) in my circle that are not from high school. A lot of them are new friends from college and that makes me super excited to go to school!
I would have never thought that this was possible last year, I was so depressed and alone that I thought that my life was a waste. I still feel like that sometimes but I've been dealing with it better. I always thought that the ""it gets better"" thing wasn't true but it is. 
The most difficult thing this year was my therapist cutting our sessions down to every other week. That was hard but all you guys helped me through it! I just wanted to say thanks to everyone here who makes this space so special and welcoming!

feeling much better today.,"I've been doing a lot of thinking and looking back over different things I found some memories on facebook, several dated this time of year back to 11 years ago where there was on for today's date saying just 'I am in a state of absolute terror'. I have realised that whatever happened at this time of year (i do not know as i find it difficult to put dates/times on horrific events) is obviously a huge trigger down to several suicide failures around this time of year. My conclusion is that this has to be linked to CPTSD and if only the pdocs etc would listen to me perhaps I could get actual help. so I will work and wait and hope that in January this will happen for me.
I have enough meds to continue treatment until then at least so am not without needed medications. I have Topamax, Vitamin D3, prozac, IBS meds, fibro meds (fentanyl patches),melatonin, cholesterol meds and xanax (which I have started to titrate down and give up over the course of the next two/three months slowly and gradually) as well as a tens machine and a massage seat for my car. support groups from DS and Facebook and am also working on a couple of plays. my workload(regular job as community resource officer) is not too heavy right now as newletters, event info, grant applications etc are all done. I still have several holiday days left so I will use those whenever I need them. This is the best I can do right now so it has to be enough. I am enough with all this in place and I will ask for help when I need it. I have a few people who have agreed to come and stay with me if needed at any time.
This has removed my feelings of despair and defeat and my natural hopeful self has returned (hopefully will stay around!).
I am enjoying the gardening enormously which is a new added bonus and gives me many new things to learn. I am generally happier if I am always learning new things or researching things and developments in the world.
I will hold onto my shaky stability for dear life and I know that if I falter, I am always able to stand firm again when I remember to get help in whatever form is available to me.
please bear with me and do not give up on me. You guys help more than you will ever know.

Thank you",bipolar-disorder

Leaving verbally abusive,"I'm finally at my limit and I've been seeing a thearpist. I'm preparing my exit plan and need support from anyone that reads this. So I'm very isolated and have no family or friends not even co workers. So I've managed to save somw money. I'm not comfortable leaving with him in the house. So I plan to leave when he is not home. This process for me isn't something that happens over night. However, I'll say this and please share your opinions. I found a lady that owns an apartment complex. So I can call her and see what she has available. Now the rent and my bills will be a tight tight squeeze. But I'll manage its just going to be barely making it pay check to pay check. I'm debating if I should just call her and pay the deposit and move in what I can now. That would consist of me paying movers to move the stuff I have. But once I get the apartment. The only funiture I have is a coffee table and 2 bookshelfs and wall decor. I have no bed no couch etc. Part of me wants to stay here longer and save more money. What I really want to do is get a storage and start buying my furniture. This gives me a chance to save money still while living in this mans home. I want to move in my apartment feeling comfortable having a bed to sleep in a sofa. Because I know if I just up and move in. It will take ages to get a real matress etc. Now he is more verbally abusive. He has slapped me once, he sometimes pinches me when we're in public and I do something he doesn't like, one time he purposely he sped up the car and breaked real fast so I'd hit my head on dashboard. He mosty is verbal. So I don't feel like he is going to like punch me. Maybe a wall again. But I want to take time save. Get my stoarge ready with whay I need then move i  the apt. My goal is to be out by like march because my job will have given me max ot and I'll able to save and buy my apt stuff. I am going to have to part with certain items I bought for this mans house. I decorated it with my money and my apt is small so not all will fit. I'm trying to sell some of it now. When I move I want to still have a little savings so I can grow it slowly. Like I said I have no one in my life. If I just up and move next month it will be a tough start and I'll.be able to get some stuff like a bed. I'll get a twin. But a couch dressers ugh. I don't want to blow through my savings. I think if I moved next month I'll be able to pay the deposit, I'll pay movers, I can probably get the twin mattress plus this daybed I want. I actually might be able to get a sofa. I would be able to get lamps. But I'd hold off on the dressers and night stand. I'd need to pay someone to mount the tv in my room, I'll be able to by a tv for living room. Thats it  but then savings is looking rough if i dis that next month. I'd have to slowly build it. But it would be slow. Plus I have to see if she has an apartment available. I'm praying about it. ",bipolar-disorder

Lists,"love them or hate them? My first therapy had me making lists upon lists to the point it was rather overwhelming. 
Ten days ago when I last saw my therapist, she assigned me to make two lists. The first is to be made every night. A list of tasks or chores to complete for the following day. The idea behind this is that since I am not working, I will have plenty of things to do to occupy my time. On Thursday I allowed myself a veg day where the only items on my list was dishing and crochet. It was a glorious day yet I somehow stayed busy. 
The second list is again to be done every night. “This is what makes life worth living.”

Feeling Stupid,"I have been very forgetful for awhile now and it seems to be getting worse.  I've also been going through a severe bout of depression and anxiety.  I""m sorry if this post is confusing.  There is a lot going on in my head.
To start, I applied for sec. 8 housing in a county that was still talking applications.  This was 2 yrs ago.  Today I got a form letter from them saying they are updating their waiting list.  They list the things you're supposed to report.  One of the things is job status and changes are to reported within a few days.  I didn't report the part time job I had for a short time.  I didn't think they would need that until I was called in for a review appt.  I was on sec. 8 many years ago so I a different county so I've been through the process before.  Boy, was that a mess.  But that's a long and different story.
Now I'm very freaked out.  I afraid I'll be taken of the list and I feel like dumbest person in the world.  The office isn't open Friday's so I can apologize for my mistake and find out what they want me to do.  I put it on my calendar for Monday to call them.  Now I'll probably worry about it all weekend and continue to be miserable.
I think my brain is angry with me for forgetting something important so it's punishing me.  I was trying to cheat the system or get away with something for nothing.  I forgot because I was contraiting on my part time job after not working for several years.
It's hard to remember evening no matter how many reminders you put out.  I know why they ask for the info.  It's to make sure help goes the right people.
Also, I have an appt on the 25th with a neurologist because I developed Vertigo about a month ago and it hasn't gone away.  The left side of my face feels like my Bell's Palsy came back and my that same side of my head there's a feeling of pressure.  I thinking whatever is going on in there is contributing to my forgetfulness and frequent bouts of depression and anxiety.
I do have a place to but the rent just gone up so it's expensive to live here like everywhere else.

for me, groups and crowds give me anxiety even if I know people. People standing too close to me is a huge trigger especially out in public.

For me, it was a locked wing, open bedroom door, and observed existence. Every door was locked, and we were escorted everywhere with a nurse in the front and back. They would count heads when we got to the place we needed to go, which always seemed like many locked doors. I remember the sound the locks made. I was on suicide watch the whole time (four weeks) and was observed continuously... and I mean continuously. We got to go outside twice a day for about ten minutes or so. We didn't have much, and this was the highlight of each day. We could call, and there was a single computer for outside email. That was pretty nice. I always felt demeaned and like a criminal the whole time. My seniority did not help... but at least I was put in a single room.

Bad Week,"Late last week I spoke with my TDoc about this big issue that changed my life and why I ended up with a huge amount of guilt and shame.  The guilt was so much that almost all systems in my body broken down all at the same time.  It was so bad that I ended up with an irregular heartbeat.  The effects of the guilt are now permanent in my body.  But, any way I told this all to my TDoc.  That resulted in a required session the next day (on a Sat).  We spoke for almost two hours.  Now that it is out, I am feeling the effects very depressed.  I'm away at a conference but all day I was thinking about what happened and ended up being very suicidal.  I seriously considered getting up, leaving and showing up at the local ER or calling the TDoc.  I am still unstable.  All of the events are back now and I am stuck again down in that morass.  I gave up my power to wall this off to the TDoc.  She said that we will talk about a great deal.  So I have nothing to look forward to but going over this several times.  The guilt also has pushed my PTSD back to the foreground.  Can't sleep, keep seeing the bodies and blood laid out before me.  I can't make it, this guilt and PTSD.  ",bipolar-disorder

Superhuman ?????,I used the words nearly superhuman in a message to my love. It was meant to describe how functioning on a day to day basis can seem that way. I supported a family with a mental illness diagnosed. There were challenges when I needed hospitalization. But the constant was always to go back and work. Keep going under a guise of what some would call normal. 3 or 4 twelve hour day shifts. Were followed by one or two days off. Then it would be twelve hour nights. Year in and year out with no real sleep wake cycle. And the decision one makes that at best only affects the fate of machinery or infrastructure. At worst they affect human safety. Folks any of you that functioned or are still functioning. Any of you that choose life over a far worse alternative.  You're survivors of things that frighten others to the point of not wanting to imagine themselves in our situations. All of us with mental illness are winning and living under conditions others fear to their core. So superhuman seems to be somewhat accurate. I'm proud of my resilience.

Anyway, the truly made me so sick! Just wondering about anyone else’s experience with it are. ",bipolar-disorder
Rethinking,"A couple o weeks ago I told you I was going to a free consultation for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.  I was going to try it but my 1st I missed because I got very lost in Portland and had to reschedule.  I cancelled again because my son's grandma needed a favor.  It was easier if stayed home to do it.  It's a long story.  Also, I didn't ask my Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner about this.  I know I should.  I have an appointment with her on the 26th.  The treatment involves going in for a session everyday for several days.  That's a lot of driving for me.
I have postponed trying this for now.

Who are you?,"It took me years of peer abuse neglect and rejection to learn who I am. Don’t let your illness define you. I bought a giant poster board and in the middle I wrote “Who I am” and all around it I wrote my positive qualities and surprisingly I filled the entire board. 
It’s true that you are who you choose to be. My best qualities are the relationships I hold: sister, daughter, aunt. I am strong and compassionate and intelligent and creative.

Smoking like a fiend,since I got out of the hospital I’ve been going through half a pack or more a day. That’s more than 10 cigarettes while before I was only smoking 4ish a day. My bank account is dwindling and I know I have to stop smoking or I won’t have money to buy more and my parents won’t enable this bad habit. At least they aren’t hitching at me and lecturing me to quit. In the hospital one of the ladies said she used big pretzel sticks to quit smoking. Maybe I’ll try that and go back to nicotine gum. ,bipolar-disorder
One screwed up Cookie,"This is what one ICU nurse told me at about 3:00 AM when I was in there after one of my surgeries. This moniker rings true with me, especially after two sessions in a week. I see that as proof of damage and severity of the same.
The line of thinking that I wanted to convey is that my ego (sense of self, and how I see myself) was destroyed by the event. I put my body under so much stress that everything broke, hence the long list of medical ailments. Some of the illnesses are permanent - cardiac, sleep apnea, migraines, bowels. I am in the grieving process but have not progressed beyond grief and shame. I am stuck at stage one and two. This is because I have nothing to rebuild my sense of self upon. I can no longer answer the question of who I am. We are all unique in our ways; I am a blank slate to write upon, but what do I write on it and do I even deserve to do so.  Who am I, am I that event forever, or is it possible to move on.  I have been at this grief stage for over two years.  I destroyed my body, career, and marriage.  Who am I?",bipolar-disorder
Can't mentally take this anymore,"I feel really selfish but I feel I can't mentally take what I'm about to explain anymore. My husband is sick with multiple sclerosis and he constantly is talking about his medical condition, his aches and pains and his problems with MS. I am always there for him and always taking care of him when he goes in the hospital and gets really bad but it's gotten to the point where I just can't bare it. Atleast I feel that way. He never wants to do anything anymore it's like he's given up on life. All we ever do is sit in bed and watch TV. I'm an active person, I like to go to parks or the beach but he never wants to do that stuff anymore. We have a 2 year old son and I'd love to be more active with him it doesn't help that my meds make me so tired all the time. I try to do things with other people but I live far away from my family and when I moved a few years ago I didn't make many friends out here. I feel so hopeless and depressed. Part of me wants to take my son for a while and move in with my parents, I'd be closer to my family and my son would be around his cousin more .I'd have more things to do and healthy people around.

Been awhile,"It has been awhile since I have been on this site. The last time I wrote something I think was when my best friend past away. It has been awful without her that is for sure. Since than I had my twins both boys which has been lately scary. The last week I realized that they are getting old enough that I can really mess things up. Just scary is all.
As far as bipolar my emotions are all over the place. One of my friends actually it is my best friend husband he plays a huge role in my life and my kids. The problem is he just never trust me. I get he is concerned because I have two babies but will it ever end. He has been through hell and back not only losing his wife he also had his leg amputated above the knee so he is trying to find his way which he isn’t doing a great job.  Yesterday he just lost it he read a letter that his wife left him he lost it. He has a good friend that he is helping out who also is bipolar so he went off saying things I’m sure he regrets but they were said. My question is or I was wondering if anyone has someone that they are really close to and that person just is waiting for you to screw up. No matter what I do I’m beginning to feel he will always see my bipolar first and not me. If I wasn’t bipolar he wouldn’t be watching me like a damn hawk it is making me crazy. I’m beginning to question everything I do I guess I really need him to trust me. You can hear that he feels that way and my kids are going to pick that up and I can’t have them not trust or believe in me.  
So does anyone else have people that are close to them not trust that they are ok. He is far from being ok and he is worried about me WTF do I have to do. I already question if I can be a great mom not just because of my bipolar but just being me and he just makes me question myself more. What do I do I have tried to talk to him but that never goes well I always get upset and start crying. Maybe he is right when he tells me it is me that doesn’t trust myself and not him.  So other question is does anyone worry that they will just screw up and so you are scared of living. I hope I’m making sense. Any thoughts would be really helpful. Namaste Pema

Making friends is difficult,"Like I've said before I am an older student. I'm just so ready to be done school. I just want to start my career and my life. I feel like such a failure. I don't have many friends at school and it makes me sad. I do understand though, the age difference and I’m not very social. Last semester I became the volunteer chair of a club hoping to get more friends, but it doesn’t seem to be working. I know I should put myself out there more but I’m wary. Some other students came up to me and started talking to me while I was sitting at the club office but I was so scared of saying the wrong thing and embarrassing myself that I didn’t say much at all. I hope I didn’t come off as aloof or rude. I don’t know which is worse; it feels like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to making friends. Does anyone have any ideas about makign more firends?

Hey everybody, 
I'm back after a three-year absence. I’ve been struggling as of late and always thought of this as a safe space for me and I’m glad to be back. I’ve gone back to school and I’m learning that I’ve forgotten so much. I’m in a very basic math class for my major and even there I am struggling. I’ve hired a tutor but it’s expensive and I feel very overwhelmed. My eating disorder is coming back and I don’t know what to do. But I’m not very low, I just feel paralyzed, I feel too scared to move but I know I have to keep going. I feel like I put my life on hold by not completing college, I’m nowhere near where I want to be in life. I just feel so hopeless.

New BP2 Diagnosis,"Hi all, 
So after many years of believing my struggle was with medication resistant major depressive disorder and GAD I have just recieved a probable diagnosis of bipolar type 2. 
On researching medication options and learning more about BP2 I am feeling kind of freaked out and not particularly hopeful, especially as historically my body has not coped well with medications (elevated liver enzymes etc.)
For the last year or so I have blogged openly about my mental health journey but as of yet I don't feel able to write about this latest development...for some bizarre reason I am finding this new ""label"" particularly difficult to swallow?!? 
Anyway, I guess I was hoping to get some further insights and reassurance from others out there who have navigated the realities of bipolar in the hope that I can process things more readily. 
Thanks in advance!

Just Joined!,"Hey guys! I'm new here.
I'm going to share some of my story discovering my wild brain. Feel free to tell me your story, or just say anything. I'd love to make friends.
So I have an unofficial diagnosis of bipolar 2. My therapist doesn't really make official diagnoses because she doesn't really like insurance companies, and that's kind of the biggest reason to have an official diagnosis. Buttt we've talked a lot about it and she's said that would be her diagnosis. I also go to a psychiatrist, but I haven't been seeing her long enough for a bipolar diagnosis.
I was originally diagnosed with depression and GAD when I was 14; that's when I started seeing a therapist. I started having short periods of what I called my ""crazy side"" where my mind would race and I felt like I had no control of my body. I would be so talkative and talk so so fast. It showed up as extreme euphoria or extreme anger. I almost ran into a gas pump once because my boyfriend made me mad (that's a story for another day).
I was introduced to bipolar disorder by a friend whose dad had it. I related to the symptoms so much when she explained it I felt like I had been enlightened to this whole new idea of life. It was a breath of fresh air to understand why I do what I do.
From then on we started treating my bipolar disorder, not depression, and I've gotten so much better. I'm currently on 50mg of zoloft and 300mg of lithium.
I also struggle with dissociating really bad. That's probably become the worst and most dibilitating of my symptoms.
Well, that's my mental health journey summed up. Feel free to drop questions or comments, or even just a hi.  :)",bipolar-disorder

I was wrongfully diagnosed as depression first as many of us were. My question for everyone is what has brought on your guyes diagnosis? What was your breaking point, if you guys dont mind sharing? I guess, all in all, what is YOUR guys story if you want to share?
Like stated before, i was always ""depressed"" so i got help and my doc put me on a antidepressant, which then skyrocketed my into oblivion. I spend thousands of dollars on my credit cards on who knows what as i was shoplifting like crazy to. Till i got arrested, did some hard time (2 WHOLE hours) and was actin a dam fool. Then i went back to my doc explained what happened, got shipped off to the psych ward and was diagnosed and that is what my life has been since. A lot of research and reading on it, and it has explained a lot about who i am and was. I mean i did everything from eating disorder, self harm, reckless sex(with boys and girls) drugs, impulsive deicsions, self medicating, i mean absolutely close to everything. 
So, if you feel comfrotable, please share with me what has brought u to where you are today. ",bipolar-disorder
For those on Lamictal..,"Just got my new script for my new meds, (seems like I say that a bit to often). I was prescribed 25 milagram lamictal and was said to increase to 50 mil in two weeks and drop the abilify after one week. I also got my clonopin doubled and my adderall changed up for my ADHD.

So when my coffee wears off and I crash the groggyness is intense. But when I take seroquel. I sleep good. I can't imagine how someone takes Ambien each night. I take it to avoid mania.

Newly diagnosed & have started Lamictal...,"Hello, group...
I'm 59 years young & newly diagnosed BP, after decades of what every Dr. I saw thought was ""merely"" major depressive disorder, anxiety & ADHD. The depression & anxiety, treated with every antidepressant known to man, would wax and wane (sometimes to extremes) - but I was always, always, always incredibly irritable.
On top of a pretty hefty crisis with one of my teenage children (he's ADHD, with an unspecified mood disorder & refuses to take prescribed medication --- but is all for taking street drugs & feeding his active substance abuse -- and at 17, ran away 6 weeks ago) -- I've also recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm sure this is why my depression and anxiety has increased exponentially.
While feeling utterly out of control, tearful all the time, etc. I went to see the Dr. I HAD been seeing -- and felt completely blown off... it was as if she just couldn't be bothered with me. It was then that I decided to look for another Dr. -- and just happened to luck into one that was able to see me soon. His reviews on Yelp were mixed -- but, generally, I don't pay much attention to those (I don't even know why I looked!)... and thought I'd chance it.
I'm so glad I did! He has been amazing! I've never had a Dr. that has ever spent so much time LISTENING to me, asking questions & explaining what he thought was going on & why. He's put me on Lamictal - starting at 25 mg once a day (will increase slowly), and Klonapin .5 three times a day. He's taking me off of sertraline (slowly) and lorazepam.
Today is only day 5 of the new meds & I am quite nauseated, with an awful headache. Everything I've read about Lamictal says that these are probably side effects --- my question is this: has anyone found a way to mitigate these side effects? I'm trying to tough it out, carry on & ignore them -- but, it's pretty hard to concentrate at work, or do housework, etc. at home, when I feel so YUCKY. Will the nausea eventually go away?
I'd appreciate hearing about YOUR experiences with Lamictal, if you'd care to share...
Thank you!

Work In Progress,"I'm seventeen years old, an recently I was disgnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I thought I would try to get my feelings out in the open with people who would understand what it's like to live like this. No one really understands me; a part of me is glad they don't because it exhauseting to live like this. School is about to start again and it's stressing me out, I don't know how I'm going to keep my grades up and manage all these responiblities. I can't sleep or eat, I get so depressed and then I get anxious, not knowing how Im going to feel the next day, am I going to be super motivated and energized or so depressed I don't get up the next day? it's scary to me, my whole life I've never been in control of myself, didn't understand what was happening to me and now that I know; it's like reality hit me in the face. I'm not coping very well. I've sought out threapy which has been helping. I know that I am a fighter, tried my best even though my best didn't always look like stright A's. I'm just tired of fighting all the time, for everything. Tired of everything and everyday life being twice as hard for me than it is for everyone else and tired of trying my best to not feel self pity. I'm seventeen and I'm already tired of life and that just doesn't seem fair to me. I know I have to keep my chin up and look on the bright side; but sometimes I get so damn tired of people telling me that and telling me they understand when they don't. everyone is so understanding and 'there for you' until they actually have to deal with me during an episode or mood swing and they get mad at me as if I'm doing it on purpose. I think I just want to heard and understood, I don't want to sound like I'm complaining or ungreatful but sometimes this is just how I feel and I wanted to say it for once instead of always being perfect when I'm not.

Giggling husband,"My husband and I have been married almost 28 years.  I'm just going to get to my question.  Last night I realized that whenever he is attracted to someone, he says something negative to throw me off.  Last night I mentioned the last time that we saw his exwife, when I said she looked good.  Has aged well and has had some work done.  He said she has been rode hard and put up wet.  When I called him on it tonight, he was just silent for a bit, then tried to change subject.  Conversation went back to her.  He talks with his 33 year old daughter, then let it slip little things from their conversations.  Nothing upsetting, but the whole package tonight.  Then I made a comment when I die, you are going after her, aren't you?  He started laughing with his face in the bed.  The bed shook.  He laughed harder than I have seen in years!!!  Like a guilty boy!!!  Or as I said later a dirty old man!  Everytime I mentioned, he looked guilty and giggled.  Like for the next hour.  Of course I was the problem!!!  Tried to deflect.  She has been promiscuous after a long marriage with second husband.  My husband and she dated for 6 years and his family loved her.  I think he has wanted to see her have problems as a result of her leaving him for another man.  Sort of like she got what she deserved.  Not relevant.  He said he laughed because he would get VD.  Too much giggling for that.  He acted like I am crazy.  I am bipolar but...and have another chronic disease. Stable but may lead to my demise.  I feel like he was guilty and entertained the thoughts...and was busted.  He was not laughing at me for suggesting that as a possibility.  That I am sure of.  That would have been ok.  Not the case.
Am I overreacting?  Sure doesn't feel like it.  He would never be honest about this, if...Ready to move out of our bedroom and just become roommates.  Of course we have other issues, but need feedback.   I don't have a lot of friends...",bipolar-disorder

Another Depression Episode,"Here it is, again.  Depression has crept up on me, making me miserable.  All I can do at this time is sit here and cry on and off.  
About a month ago I developed Vertigo that isn't going away.  I saw my Dr about this and she referred me to a neurologist.  I have an appointment with the neurologist on September 25th.  They couldn't get me in any sooner.  It's such a long time to wait for answer for what's causing this.  Meanwhile I have to put up with the dizziness and feeling of pressure on the left side of my head.  That's the side I had Bell's Palsy on and it feels slightly numb since the Vertigo started.
There's so many things I need and want to do but because of the fatigue this has caused it's hard for me to much of anything.  I feel so trapped in my own body and mind.
I don't have a big support system.  Much of my family works and don't live near me.  My son gets angry when I cry.  His grandmother who we live with doesn't understand what I'm going through and isn't the comforting type of person.  My friends also moved away.  I don't really have any friends nearby.  My boyfriend lives an hour away.  He is kind and compassionate but I don't want to wear out our relationship with my problems.  I'm afraid of wearing out my family and friends with my problems, too.
You would think that after having bp for so many years that I would be used to it but it's still painful as always.  All I can do for now is ride it out like I've done so many times before.",bipolar-disorder

Parts talk II :-D,"
Settled into the armchair in front of the fireplace in my inner refuge is my guide. He motions towards a similar chair inviting me to sit. I ask him to wait until I make a cup of coffee and he says “No problem. No rush. Take it easy.”

I arrive back and sit. “Welcome back. Are you willing to talk?” A bit nervously I say “Sure.”

A thought stream arrives. The expressions of a number of parts. Parts are best thought of as little people inside us. All thoughts and emotions are the expressions of parts. “Fuck, you're a loser”! “Dipshit”! “You're nothing”! And finally “If you show this writing to someone they will say you hear voices and are mad”.

Gobsmacked and overwhelmed I lose track of reality and the present moment and fear has me in it's grip. I feel as if I am falling down a black hole. I feel trapped, hopeless and helpless.“You need to leave room for me” says my guide. I find myself no longer falling and back in the chair. I had become stuck. My parts had taken me out.

“What do you know that can help me?” I enquire of my guide.

He explains... “Well, I know that irritation, anger and scorn are linked to suffering. So the parts in that thought stream are suffering or afraid of suffering in the future, like they did in the past, and are taking it out on you. If you become curious about what they fear you will likely develop compassion for them.”

I consider what the parts said and again see the fear of being locked up in a mental ward prominent. They follow some attacks upon me designed to soften me up by lowering my esteem and frightening me into retreat and silence. So, using my training, I ask myself how I feel towards the parts. There is some resentment for what I see as an unprovoked attack.

Here I was trying to talk to my guide and they have interfered to disrupt the process in a decidedly unfriendly manner. I realise resentment is yet another sign of suffering. This means their suffering has made me suffer as well, which is very common.

My guide speaks “They are polarized with the part that I invited to have a seat”.

I let that sink in... then ask “How do you know I am a part?”

“Two reasons. Firstly you were nervous instead of confident and secondly you feel resentment instead of compassion... these are not traits of your true Self but the emotions of a part”.

Another barrage from some parts arrives... “This sounds like nonsense to me”! “Nutter”! “We are going to make this sound like you have dissociative identity disorder you loser so that you can't show this to anyone”

I realize I am my writing part. My narrator. I tell them I understand they are worried about me explaining my experience, it being used to prove I am insane according to their beliefs. Also that I appreciate how hard they are working to stop me writing, how important it is to them that I stay safe and free. I feel compassion. I feel them take that in and soften a little.

Feeling disappointed and low- may trigger some,"Sunday has generally been a good day for me since this is usually a day of rest from my daughter's severe anxiety and bouts of depression(her boyfriend comes weekends and her mood lightens). Today however I feel badly because I fear tomorrow's visit at the doctor for her will not treat her mood effectively. They gave her Latuda before and it so was awful she had to stop taking it then when she requested to get in earlier to see her doctor they refused to help her get an emergency appointment (so she's had to wait 3 agonizing weeks til her normal appt which is tomorrow, to get a new med). I don't know if she can handle another serious disappointment..this last week has been one of the worst. She has been borderline suicidal but said she didn't want to hurt herself (so they won't hospitalize her) and needed for me to sit with her almost every day to feel safe and stable enough to make it through. This scares me and makes me feel powerless. I had to call off work once last week to make sure she felt safe and work is upset putting more pressure on me. Good thing I was made for this darkness and can calm and lighten my daughter's fears because I too have obviously experienced frightening mental health episodes. I have come through the fire,  changed my life for the better, and have learned to rely on management/skills to pull me through my times of need. It is hard on me to do this with my daughter because I love her so much and feel much more powerlessness due to our bond. I know I am projecting into the future and we are not there yet..we only have the present ...but I am still worried. I used to pray in times like this to get the strength to carry me through the day but instead I am sitting here feeling sorry for myself. I have an open long distance relationship with a long time friend/boyfriend of mine and feel the need to be comforted by him. He knows what has been happening over the last several months and gives me comfort when I reach out but it must not register in his mind how serious this issue has gotten recently. He doesn't understand the toll it is taking on me, how alone I feel right now and how afraid I am for my daughter if things don't start going better and ultimately for myself if things take a turn for the worse. I would like him to be more present but he is in more than one relationship, has a busy work schedule, has a son living at home and requires down time for himself..He is basically spread too thin. I need more of him even if that is all true as well as reaching out here and maybe getting into counseling again if things stay the same. My friends are all connected to work--and they are overwhelmed with the staffing problems there making me want to avoid them. The only other good friend is disabled and in bed half the time due to her own depression brought on by her boyfriend and family members who have past in recent years. My sister is overbearing- yet means well- but also lives a few hours away and I probably should reach out more to her.
I guess I just needed to vent today. I also bought myself materials to make a pretty fall wreath yesterday and believe it time to work on that to lift my spirits.",bipolar-disorder

"Medicine, too take or not too take. That is the qu","Hello, im new here. Currently in a funk, the reason i found a bipolar chat room to participate in. I was on abilify for 2 years, then (like the stereotypical bipolar person does) I quit. I had absolutely terrible withdrawal effects to the extent of ripping out hair, humming, scratching, scab picking. I was absolutely disguisting for a while. Anyways, after I quit i got manic and was a okay with it. Then, i dropped and im depressed. Its odd because i feel really crappy and think i should go back on meds again because it would help, others are on it, i cant help i have an illness that needs meds, and any other pro med points i could make. But then again i dont want to go back on because the come off was terrible. Plus, like meds can shorten your life span, and i dont like the idea of being on meds the rest of my life. And its just crap. Idk what to do. I dont want to be that person who refuses their meds and what not but i dont want to take them. There is something in me that makes me not want to take them. Im clueless. Any input is helpful. Thank you",bipolar-disorder

For so long now,"Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar.  My MD and therapist both agree that I have most likely have had it since my early teens. I just turned 59.  This explains so many things that have happened in my life.  I'm sure that this has happened to many of us.  While it's quite eye openning but it's so frightening at the same time.  My MD has me on Trileptal and Wellbutrin.  It seems to work somewhat, but I keep falling back thinking of the past that this crap has wasted/ruined. Has anyone else have this happen and if so, how have you dealt with this kind of experiance and revelation?",bipolar-disorder
question on sudden sex impulse in bipolar 2 wife,"I was married for 48 yrs to a woman who was finally diagnosed with Bipolar 2. She had an least 2 affairs before diagnose was made. She never admitted the affairs despite evidence of both.  I am reading about sudden sexual impulses. One affai was at a christmas party at a Brownie meeting. She brought the guy into the house to meet me. Did not know about she was caught having sex with the guy by our daughter untio the next day. She denied it. The second time I came home from work about 1 hr early, about 10PM. When I entered the bedroom the smell of recent sex was very strong. We had 2 children ages 5 and 10 ib]n the house.This time she  said you cannot prove anything. My question is: How overwhelming is the impulse to have sex ? And is you cannot prove anything a common reply and admission?

Bipolar I vs II because of Cycles,"I was at my TDoc, who I think she is about 325 years old, but she said that I have Bipolar I due to the number of cycles a year that I have.  I have never heard of this distinction before.  My understanding was the level of mania that drives the diagnosis.  What do you think?",bipolar-disorder
TDoc Today,"Not sure where to post this, Bipolar or PTSD.  It is both.  I am still so screwed up, I don't know which end is up at this point.  On the PTSD side, we started to talk about some medical issues and I relayed my first surgical expercience and how inhumane it was and how I remember the event.  I was crying over the event and then she showed how it related back to my central war-zone PTSD.  I never made that connection between the two and it answers why this one event causes me so much heartache.  Every time I remember back to my first operation that I can hardly make it through without either crying or leaving the story untold.  We talked about the PTSD a few weeks ago but I told her to back off and leave that alone till I can trust her.  My other TDoc told everyone at my work and my other doctors about what I had and what we were discussing.  My current TDoc hit on my PTSD today.  I am still unsettled by it all.  On the bipolar side, she said it was not a mental illness but a brain chemical imbalance and the drugs will help me to manage it.  She chided me for seeing myself as being, 1. broken, and 2. having a mental illness.  She may say this but the rest of society, including my wife, say different.
She stirred up quite a bit in me.  It left unguarded many painful points in my psyche.  Should I let her do that again.  What if she turns out like the last... I saw her for 14 months every week and no progress.  At point she yelled at me to ""stop this"" and to ""snap out of it"".  This of course didn't work.  She never dealt with what is at the center of all this.  ",bipolar-disorder
Sleep Sounds/Music,"So I have a Cyclic Rhythm Sleeping Disorder and I always use a Sleep Sound Machine, as I was looking online for newer model Saturday and checking out reviews on YouTube I came across a couple of really good YouTube channels that offered what I was looking for in a Sound Machine.
These channels have really good quality music/natural sounds, i.e. rain, thunder, ocean on up to 10 hour ad free streams.  I tried a couple different ones over the last 2 nights and they were awesome.  Just loaded them up on my laptop, I was able to set the sound to exactly where I wanted it, and fell asleep faster, more relaxed and they stayed constant throughout the night.
Didn't have to bother buying a new Sound Machine.  Just thought I'd share the Channels if anyone is interested.

As a result of being abused in this way by this lady I had a meltdown in front of everybody which was very humiliating and for which I take complete responsibility - in other words that aspect of the situation was entirely my own fault.  I am in charge of myself and doing what I have to to maintain a level state of mind, even in a crisis.

Coming back to check in,"Hi i am Merry May and have been involved with this group on and off for several years. Just coming back for general support. I have stressors but for over a year and a half now have been handling life without therapy! I didn't think I would be able to but several years of going enabled me to believe in myself enough to try it on my own. I plan to always keep the idea of therapy as a back up support just in case circumstances become to overwhelming. I thought it would be a good time to check in on the forum to put in place an extra layer of support.

So much has changed since i first came years back. I have a job now for 12 hours per week that I've kept for 3 years! It has helped give me purpose and allows me to express my creativity and for that I am grateful. My daughter is now days away from being 18 and unfortunately she is being run down by her evolving mental illness issues but to be honest i am glad to be there for her as a strong advocate. It's been really hard recently but at the same time she knows she's not alone and keeps dreaming her dreams of going to college even though it feels like it's not possible right now. We got good news today, from the college she's been accepted to, and they are letting her take online classes the first semester. We believe this will give her more time to get the correct meds before she has to drive there every day the 2nd semester. It's one day at a time but that's ok because it used to always be that way for me for many years and it still is some days.

So glad to be back.

Been Awhile~~,"Since I've posted in the bp room, actually been anywhere on ds except my journal. So for the ole timers, hello, and new bp'ers hello too.
I wanted to share something with you that I've been coming to terms with, have known, yet have not really put into practice due to fear...thinking fear, real fear, projected future fear. My fears have stopped me in many areas of my life...I've used my dx as an excuse, self talk as an excuse to not do what in 'reality I can do'.
Another share is the word 'control'. Since I have been out of control, psychotic, back in 1984, I know the fear of loosing control. Yet the word control not only promotes my fear, it creates my fear when something or someone doesn't do what ""I Think"" should happen, for my best good, or their best good.
Now combining fear and control as a single parent, I've hurt my son because I've not let him 'fall' in order to have him learn he can get back up. Yes, he has aspergers, that is not an excuse to no live life to his fullest. Yes, I have bp, that is not an excuse to not live my life to the fullest.
Today I celebrate my 66th birthday. My son is in a rehab with two blood clots in his legs, one in his lung and recovered pnemonia in both lungs, he is 23. What he suffers from is a disease that normally people in their 60's can get if they don't '''get up and move their body'''. I hurt for him, I cry for him, as well as anger, frustration and throwing my hands up in the air and giving up.
Giving up, for me is loosing control...and So I'm gifting myself the loss of control over my son today. Some ole timers on bp might remember I had cancer and only have one kidney..it's failing. I was recently in the hospital for 9 days due to a tick bite and my kidney function went down to 17%.
Fear took hold of me, I stopped doing things I loved to do, anxiety gripped me as well as depression. Then a month later, to the day, July 23, my son's birthday, we spent in the ER for 10hrs...he was dx'd. So we have both had 'life changing illnesses and experiences' within one month's time.
I chose today to push past my fear, I've not worked in my gardens since June, today I did. I chose to push past my fear, I told my son, I'm done, you are an adult, from now on you make your own decisions. If you want my help or advice, ask, if I can help I will if I can't I won't. I'll offer my advice or opinion, then ''the decision will be up to him"".
If he falls, he'll have to pick himself up.
For years, I've gone to a restaurant that has The Best Pie. To celebrate, I got us pie and brought it up to rehab.
I also gifted myself a T-shirt that I've wanted for Years from this restaurant. This too is how I'm going to move forward, to  the best of my ability to face fear and control...push past~~
~~""Life Is Short, Eat Pie""~~
I hope anyone who reads this post, you'll find ""your pie"" and totally enjoy each mouthful!
My best to you, ml",bipolar-disorder
drug interactions,"This morning I wasn't doing well, so I took 10 mg Flexeril/cyclobenzaprine, 0.5 mL cannabis oil, and one drink of alcohol to calm the anxiety because I'm trying to reduce my Ativan. Well the combination of these 3 medications and drugs/alcohol I ended up with heart palpitations and my muscles throughout my body tightening up very stiffly. I had to take 3 Ativan which settle things down a bit but I'm still in a lot of pain. I also think I need to reduce my Flexeril/cyclobenzaprine muscle relaxant to 17.5 mg total per day because 15 mg was not enough and 20 mg is too much and I get heart palpitations. I also get heart palpitations for morning anxiety as well as the jitters/small quick tightening muscle spasms. Instead of making myself better, I made myself worse.

A few weeks ago I needed to see another therapist temporarily, I like my new therapist quite a lot but it is a really rough adjustment especially given the abrupt change. I’m comfortable in session and even probably accomplished things I never have before. My issue really isn’t with therapy even with the changes I still feel like it is my safe place and it’s a good experience. What is really getting to me is my lack of support I don’t have friends in the sense that I have someone to spend time with. I am socially awkward and have anxiety and don’t feel comfortable around groups of people and I worry that people think I’m weird and I just wish I could find people like me I have friends like me but I guess they’re not good enough friends to actually want to hang out with me. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone today and went to a Harry Potter party at my local library it gave me anxiety and I was disappointed that it was really just geared for kids and I felt stupid being there alone but I stayed because I promised people I would get out of the house and do something. I wish I could meet other nerdy people like me I know they’re out there I have friends like that but they’re the ones that complain of never going out or having friends but they never ask if I want to do anything either",bipolar-disorder

Boyfriends mom schizophrenic/bipolar,"So I have been with my boyfriend 4 years. The first time I met his mother he had warned me that she is bipolar and schizophrenic. She was about 63 and she wore jeans and had her granny panties out and a belly shirt. Her stomach was out and she is overweight and she said hello to me and flashed me her tatas. So I hate to say it but me having bipolar I this was something a whole other level. So my boyfriend is not close to his parents. We see them less than 6 times a year. So My boyfriend and his father are always trying to get the mom back to normal. When the moms father died she hit a rock bottom and hasn't been a tolerable bipolar. she attempted suicide and ever since his dad won't leave her alone because she's basically on 24/7 suicde watch. She gets locked up numerous times since he was a kid. She runs around naked. she gets shock treat 7 times a month. I don't understand how thats legal. but she gets it, she had shock treatment and couldn't remember my name. She takes meds but his dad says she is resistant, she goes weeks without showering. When shes good it lasts less than 2 months  My boyfriends dad is dying and getting tripple bypass soon. I have a bad feeling and my boyfriend has told me before locking her up us expensive, i know his parents have the funds to do so. I'm support him but if she moves in I refuse to babysit to avoid her committing suicde I am not forcing her to shower. I work from home. I refuse to not not go on errands because she may commit suicide. His dad has spent the last 10 years on suicide watch. My boyfriend has said numerous times he feels awful for his father. the mom doesn't want to travel doesn't want to eat sometimes she'll drive to McDonalds, my boyfriend and his dad claim the mother us fake because she thinks for herself and will cook herself food, but won't clean, she'll leave dog poo on the floor and the dad has to clean it. So I'm preparing for the worst. I am going to be pregnant soon. I am going to support him. But he is responsible for her. We should not be on 24 hour suicde watch, he's like we'll if you need to run errand wait until I'm home. he's home by 8pm, His mom says she can care for herself but we would have to drive there to make sure she didn't kill herself.

I thought a service dog was not to be petted so as not to distract it from its human. 
Back in the break room one of my coworkers came in with the dog in tow. She proceeded to talk about how she bought the vest online to keep people from petting the dog even though SHE IS NOT DISABLED!!!

My inner therapist asks the voice about it's view. “What do you think will happen if you write without a plan?” Back comes the response “I will just ramble without purpose.”
Some other parts chime in. “You never show anyone anything anyway” and “You are such a loser” respectively.
I notice these comments but ask these parts to leave room for me to listen to my part that is worried about rambling when I write. I listen to the background noises within my environment. The gentle music. The birds singing in the pre-dawn warm up to their daily chorus. The sound of the air conditioner blowing warm air into the winter chill. I feel the air circulating with the hairs on my arms. I am still again.
“Well then my friend, let's see if we can discover a purpose for you shall we?” comes the offer of help from a trusted mentor part. Mixed thoughts arise on that subject. Firstly a desire for money. Secondly one for fame. Thirdly to save the world. Again I notice all these aspects but return to the worried part. I am curious as to what it thinks will happen if it rambles without a purpose?
Good grief! It is afraid of being locked up in a mental home or retirement village with a whole heap of crazy people. The poor thing! No wonder it stops me writing. On the one hand I remember terrifying experiences of being hospitalised. On the other a memory of my dad confused in a retirement home with vascular dementia surfaces. Ominous dark clouds surround my worried part indeed.
The good thing about being trained is that you know the right move for the right situation and you are careful not to over-extend yourself. What I mean is that I am skilled enough to go this far... to the point where the underlying fear is discovered. I am also wary enough of re-opening old wounds for no purpose to leave the work of healing the wounded parts to someone trained at looking in blind spots like the one I found above.
I send the worried part my appreciation for all it's hard work keeping me safe. I let it know I really get why it feels it is so important that I don't write down random nonsense. I also let it know I am not trying to get rid of it, but instead want to work with it to keep me safe. I can feel it relax some as it takes that appreciation in.  I let it know I will not try and interfere with it doing it's job. It is in charge of it's own destiny with me.

Crazy Pants!,"So I left work early today.  I needed some time off and I pulled chocks early.  When I got home, I put on a pair of my ""crazy pants"" and lounged like a tree-less sloth.  When I went into the hospital last time, I had a few days to ready myself as the insurance was being worked out.  Also, I was rather closely watched by PDoc and TDoc.  So back to pants, I was going to live in sweats while inside, and I had to cut out the strings of all of them.  So I have three sets of sweats with no string and that reminds me of the hospital.  Sometimes I look back and see how far I have come, and others I wonder if I have advanced at all.

Help me,"so yesterday and today I have been filled with severe rage. I just want to break a bunch of stuff it isn’t funny and at the same time I want to kick and scream and cry. A couple days ago I stupidly had a party and someone I rly love and care about almost died. We ended up getting busted bc I had to tell his sister or he could’ve choked on his puke and I don’t regret telling her bc i wanted him safe. My mom went on crackdown and put cameras in our house and I have to do a miles long list of chores everyday and it’s making me crazy. I just want to chill with friends or live my life and enjoy summer but I will never get to do that. I get that I shouldn’t have been drinking but unless your weird, all teenagers do it atleast once. I just am filled with so much anger and pain and emotions right now. It isn’t even getting grounded and stuff either I have other stuff going on, like the boy I’m in love with who I did stuff with didn’t want to be with me and after I told him how I felt, he agreed. But it’s like he didn’t bc nothing Changed and I just got more and more broken.

Lonley as usual,"Things subsided for a while,I guess I was distracted from being alone because I finally found a way to make money. 
But slowly things are seeping back into the dull,  monotonous,same sh*t - different day type feeling. 
Im 5 states away from any family or friends,Ive been here over a year now and all the friends I have are my husbands friends so really they're not my friends at all. Theyre just nice to me and come around because of my man and thats only sometimes. 
Unlike me they have lives and things to do. I have one friend,thankfully,we talk everyday and get along great but she lives about an hour away and we rarely get to hang out. 
My husband works 5 days a week and is soon starting football again soon so that means Ill have zero days a week to be together. Mon-friday is work and Saturday and sunday is football. 
As always Ill be sitting here alone watching people shop on youtube just so I dont feel so alone.

Extremely fatigued,"I'm not sure what's causing it.  I'm experiencing extreme fatigue.  About a month ago I developed Vertigo.  The Vertigo isn't as bad as when it first happened but I haven't felt right since.  I've seen my Dr. and she referred me to a neurologist.  I have an appointment with them on September 25th.  That's the soonest they could get me in. 
I know this seems off topic for the Bipolar group but I've seen many posts about similar things.  
Like many of you, I live in a less than ideal situation.  My son and his grandma don't understand what it's like to be me.  It seems like I have to do everything or it doesn't get done.  I feel so overwhelmed.
I have a job interview tomorrow.  It's for a burger restaurant that's a small local chain.  It's not ideal but I've been out the game for so long I'm start at the beginning.
I have a date with my boyfriend.  I'm superstitious about talking about my relationships because I'm afraid something bad will happen if I do.  I don't know why I developed that.  Anyway, he's my age and lives in driving distance from me.  We've been seeing each other since November.  He is very sweet and compassionate.  He has anxiety so we can relate with each other about our mental health.  I've cried in front of him because I was depressed a couple of times.  He was comforting.  That is one the many things I love about him.  I'm so afraid of losing him because of my condition.  I wish he could of known me when I was younger and more upbeat.
If at this time I need answers to what's wrong with me physically.  Also, I need compassion and understanding.  Something I don't get at home.  I know that life is tough.  I just need something to keep me going.",bipolar-disorder

New Drugs,"Saw the PDoc today.  My third time with him.  First was an intro, the second was to deal with immediate mania, and now I get the new drug change up.  I am leaving my cocktail for something new.  How do I know this will work? He says it will... but I have been told that often- ""do this therapy, you will feel better"", ""do this surgery, it will heal you"", ""take these drugs it will help you"".  I have been told these lies and tales for years, for dozens of drugs and therapy hours, and numerous surgeries.   How does this quack know more than the last, and is there any yardstick for the patient to judge one from another?  We are so much at the whims of Hippocrates up there just spinning the big wheel of medicine while we throw darts, interesting the word Hypocrite is very near. 
Ok, enough bitching.  We are just randomly receiving medical help from those that we don't know, for conditions not well understood (everyone is different, and we do not fit into neat little categories of the DSM V) with no way to judge one doctor from another.  I guess we should resort to height for judgment...its better than nothing.",bipolar-disorder

But I will never give that much of myself to another man again. 
For those of you who have past hurts, how did you get over them? It’s been six years and it’s so hard to let go. My old therapist also came up in therapy today. I never got closure with her and I never will. I don’t know how to let go. Will I ever get over either of these pains?",bipolar-disorder

Sad and lonely,"Last year was the 1st time my husband, Mike, went to Maui, Hawaii without me. It was stressful and I ended up having hypomanic episode the whole time he was gone, which is better than a depressed episode.Today he tells me he wants to book early but can't decide if he should go to Hawaii or Mexico or the Dominican Republic… And said with it being a short stay it is probably not worth going to the Dominion.… It seemed like he wanted me to say go wherever you want to stay as long as you want. If I can't say something positive I don't say anything at all. I'm not gonna fight over it. It's hard for me when he's away not just because I'm alone, but it is a huge reminder of a huge loss that I have suffered from my physical disabilities and chronic pain and being on medical cannabis that I can no longer travel or do much else.I don't think my life is worth living anymore. I'm not planning on killing myself, but I am going to stop having all preventative testing including mammograms, Pap test, and preventative colonoscopies (because my mom died in 2007 from colorectal cancer, and 1 of her sisters had colon cancer and a great uncle). My last colonoscopy I was 46 and the doctor found a polyp that could turn cancerous within 5 years and he removed it and told me to come back in 3 years. It's now over 4 years. I'm almost 51 and I don't think I'd get another one if my life stays as it is. I'd rather have a good short life than a bad long one.I think I'm just being selfish. I want him to be happy, but I wish he just didn't have to travel without me to do so.No more Maui for Maui1992 (my avatar name because my husband and I got married in 1992 in Maui at the age of 23).

Tardive dyskinesia – if you don't already know,"Tardive Dyskinesia
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious side effect that may occur with certain medications used to treat mental illness. TD may appear as repetitive, jerking movements that occur in the face, neck, and tongue. The symptoms of TD can be very troubling for patients and family members. The muscle movements are outside of the patient’s control.
Long-term use of medications called antipsychotics can cause TD. Some medications used for nausea can also cause TD. The symptoms of TD might continue even when the medication is stopped. About one in four patients who receive long-term treatment with an antipsychotic will experience TD. 
Anyone taking an antipsychotic may develop TD, but certain factors increase the risk such as:
It is important to remember that TD usually happens after taking antipsychotics for a long time. Some patients may have TD after 3 months, but many develop TD after several years of treatment. TD is unlikely to occur if an antipsychotic is only taken for a few weeks.
Later in the article it says that 1 in 4 people taking antipsychotics will develop TD at some point. YIKES! That's 1 of the many side effects that motivated me to treat myself with bipolar 2 on my own. But now I'm going to try medication likely Seroquel and see if things improve.",bipolar-disorder
Good News,"I have been under such a cloud for the past two years.  It seemed that little broke my way and life was beating me at every turn.  But, I got some good news tonight.  As you know, I am veteran and retired from 28 years on 1 Feb.  I have put two claims for disability from the Veterans Administration and the second claim decision came back today.  I received a disability of 100%.  This confers some additional monthly payment and some other benefits from the State of Florida.   I was fighting for this day and have submitted over 3,000 pages of documentation, doctor's letters, the letter's from PAs, x-rays, EKGs, EEGs, Nuke stress test and on and on and on.   A lot of work went into those claims.

Bipolar Shame,"Shame.  I always feel a great deal of shame and guilt from this disease.  You can be tried, convicted, and punished without accepting the underlying sin.  But shame, that is altogether different, you must accept that sin.   I read that others that are of the opinion that there is no shame in bipolar.  But I lie here still inconvenienced, I will do these actions again.  I know this, how can I not feel remorse for the future acts that I will commit.  Most of my mania actions are benign and rather stupid; some are not.
The counter-argument is like a heart condition you should be held blameless for your next heart attack because this is out of control and you are seeking help from a cardiac surgeon.  Mania requires volution in my mind.  I may be careless with the consequences, but this is still me acting within my agency to commit these acts.  Should I not be held liable?  And with that liability and my foreknowledge of committing future acts, should not feel shame?  Liability and criminality may follow in the future if I can't find a way to break this cycle.  
So the question - can I escape my shame?",bipolar-disorder
Bipolar and Sleep/mania,"I'm annoyed today. I've suffered from bipolar disorder long time. So I have come to realize since being diagnosed what precedes my mania. It always starts when I can't sleep. I work from home for a corporate pharmacy company. I handle review contracts all day for quality testing and quality assurance. I got my bachelor's in health care management and my masters in health care administration. So 2 years I've been working for the corporates pharmaceutical company the experience is so imperative to me. Its rough at times because for a fortune 500 company the training is awful! It is has been difficult switching careers. Initially I spent over a decade working for a university as a professor. So I know that job I know it like the back of my hand. So here I am with this pharmaceutical company and I've learned that the job assignments don't end. I see coworkers working off clock to meet deadlines. Its a ""secret"" but people are stressing. I had to record a training for a new assignment because it's the only way to remember all this stuff. I was up until 2 am last night organizing notes. I've noticed for myself if I don't sleep I can fall off the deep end. Monday for whatever reason I was manic. For me Mania is not being able to sleep or lack of sleep. I can't be up until 2 am with this madness of a career. So today I ended my shift 4:30 I'm going to bed early. No job is worth my health period. But in order to learn I have to get the training where I can. I swear this company is so huge how can they not have proper training. Its like pulling teeth to get help. I'm exhuasted and I'm going to bed. I have lost 77 pounds since working with my pdoc to cut my meds. I was 206 at 5'3 its hard not being on 800 mg of seroquel. But I have accomplished too much without meds. Its just I have peripheral hallucinations I call it shadow people I've had it since I was a kid but these medications make you fat its noy worth it. My pdoc has worked close with me. But sleep is a must. If I don't sleep all hell could pop off. I'm grateful to work from home because imagine if I did in front of a coworker. I'm now on 50 mg seroquel 100 lamictical 100 carbmazepine 150 welbutrin I feel good when I'm well rested. I ignore the peripheral hallucinations. But sleep is a must in managing my BP. I'm just venting. ",bipolar-disorder

At a loss with my son....could use advice,"Although this is a lengthy first post, I'll try to keep it short.Last November my son (18) complained of not feeling like himself. He would be quick to agitate. He would exhibit episodes of agitation, agression, crying, shaking. He would have elevated states of anxiety, depression, agitation for no apparant reason. Never a manic phase, but rather hypomanic (according to dr.)Now this is a normal, healthy 18 year old kid. Senior in HS, girlfriend, holds a job, good grades, good family.In March my son (18) was admitted to a Behavioral Health Unit and diagnosed with Unspecified BiPolar (Most likely BP2)Possible agitated anxiety, Possible Intermittant Explosive Disorder.Put on Abilify. He has had complications with every drug he has tried. Risperdal, Latuda, Vrylar....At this point he wanted to try CBD oil since he was esentially on zero antipsychotics. Started with 70mg. full spectrum 0%THC.Has a script of xanax (.25mg) should things get escalated.He had done great on the CBD oil for 3 weeks. Happy, calm, content...normal. Like he used to be.Flash forward to a break up with his girlfriend and all went downhill. I should state that his girlfriend reported a change in his personality the day of the breakup. I don't feel like the breakup was the sole cause of the mood change.Back to agitation, anger, unstable mood, etc....
His therapist feels coping skills are lacking. I feel like he can't learn any coping skills in the state he is in.We are headed back to Psychiatry and I know that the dr. will just want to put him on another mood stabilizer.He cannot take 2nd gen psychotics so we would be looking at Anticonvulsants (Tegretol)I should add that the Mental Health resources and levels of care in my area are awful.I have so many questions. Is it possible the CBD was only effective in controlling his ""good"" mood?How do I even know for a fact that we are providing the correct treatment when the doctors cannot even come up with a definitive diagnosis?His psychiatrist said if he was truly BiPolar then one of the 2nd gen meds should have worked and CBD wouldnot be strong enough as a mood stabilizer. 
Today, taking nothing, he is angry and agitated. He barely talks about anything other than he feels terrible.He thinks all I want to do is shove meds down his throat. He is depressed, mad and sad.I don't know what else I should be doing or asking for at this point.He is undergoing a ton of endocrinological blood work to look for any red flags.
Any advice is appreciated.If I posted in the wrong place, please direct me where to go and I'll remove it.Thank you

I have really, can I curse here? Idk if I can use poor language but I have terrible attendance at work because I am struggling with so much currently. I am trying to apply for disability. That is in the works. I am still transitioning with the new meds. Work moved me to a new room the other day, and I worked there, felt fine and suddenly I feel nausea and not okay. I guess because of my medicine? I know it's definitely not something that happens to everyone when they get just a little warm? It was 100 degrees, but I wasn't sweating, and I felt fine..... Regardless, I had to leave work and I might be looking for a new job now :( I needed a new job. I wanted a new job, but I didn't want to be fired. I am really needing 8 hour shifts instead of 12 hour shifts because 12 hour shifts in recovery, with co-occuring disorders is a nightmare. If there has ever been a better excuse to need a drug to help make your body do super human things, I have not seen it. Sorry this post is so all over the place by the way. Posting made me realize, I have, infact, missed my medicine this morning so I should be taking that now. But yeah, so my doctor does not really want me working 12s or in the heat with no air at the moment, and the no insurance thing is not working but my work's healthcare would actually just cost me more than not having insurance.....and I am not sure if i have a job at all right now until I get back to work and hear about my absences because IF they follow their own rules I have pointed out. However, their turnover rate is a little crazy because they work people so hard and it's not great pay for the heat and disregard for human well-being lol so maybe I am okay? I don't know if I even am still wanting to work there? I am not sure where I am today at all, I suppose. But thanks for letting me vent all this out.",bipolar-disorder

I have to have the money by August 10th.

i ALMOST disclosed,"So I need to save money in order to go back to univeriy next year. A couple of weeks ago I asked my boss for an extra shift or so a month. Then I went back and told her that I couldnt take on more hours. And then I realized, if she knew what I am going through she would be more understanding. So I walked into her office with the intention of disclosing that i have mental illness. BUT she seemed to know I was nervous and encouraged me not to disclose anything I didnt want to. AnSo go me!! My boss was very nice about everythig, especially when I explained that I wasnt to go back to school. SHe basically said whatever I need, to let her know and she wll work with my school schedule.. so YAY. She said ""DOnt worry about any work stuff, I'll handle it."" So that is a huge relief to me. I figured if I pick up three extra shifts a month, I can save $200 to put towards school. I am jsut so releivedd to ahve the work part figured out.

Co-occurring disorders and introduction,"So, my name is Ashley, and I am glad to have found this site.

I am a little worried about my new medication because I have no insurance, and when I looked at the price it is over 1000 a month. My doctor asked if I had insurance and gave me samples so hopefully that is her plan. I hope. I am really struggling with various things. I hope I am using this forum correctly by explaining what I am going through. I am currently using some group therapy through intherooms.com. I just restarted those today. I really was just looking for some community where as I go through this I can share what is going on and how I am feeling and taking things. I also just got clean from substances.

Update,"I was in the hospital for 6 days recently, following a psychotic break. Technically my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, bipolar 1 type, but I hope it's OK if I stay in this group.
I take Celexa, Lamictal, Clozaril, Zyprexa, and Ativan. I seem to be more stable now because I had another med tweak while in the hospital. But what scares me is the fact that I had the psychotic episode, despite taking 3 antipsychotic meds (my former pdoc had added Haldol prn). I asked the tdoc in the hospital, ""Is this something that's going to blindside me for the rest of my life (I'm 56)?"" She suggested asking my pdoc, which I intend to do when I see her Monday. I also see my outpatient tdoc that day. So far, so good.
I just read this, and I'm sure it's strange that I write that I'm ""more stable"" when my pdoc didn't change any of my antipsychotics. One thing I can say though, is that it was a relief that my delusions and paranoia were just fiction.",bipolar-disorder

Introduction. Hi I'm new to the group!,"
 
Hello all. I am new to this group. I have made one posting under the topic “I’m clueless”. I am currently 50 years old, married with no children but always have pets. I love animals. In my 20s I was diagnosed with agitated depression with anxiety as the main feature. I had this diagnosis for over a decade until I saw another psychiatrist who said I had bipolar 2. I did not believe it at that time, but I tried lithium anyhow. It made my hands shake so I stopped using it. She suggested I go on Seroquel, but I did not like the side effect profile. So, I stopped seeing psychiatrists and have not been in the psych ward for over 15 years. However, a few years after the diagnosis of bipolar 2, I had to let go of the denial and realized that she was right all along. I still tried just treating myself. I used light therapy for depression during the fall and winter so I think I have seasonal affective disorder as well. I started doing the light therapy just in the mornings, but when I changed to doing it in the mornings and early afternoons, I felt better the next morning. Very recently, I read an article along with the journal about a study using light therapy to treat bipolar depression and the results were very good. However, the protocol for using light therapy for bipolar depression is different than the protocol for light therapy for unipolar depression. For bipolar, they recommend increasing the light slowly and doing it mid day. I just did that today for the 1st time and see how it goes. I am considering trying gabapentin because online it says it can work as a mood stabilizer and/or antidepressant and/or reduces anxiety. I was on this medication before for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) and I don’t recall any significant side effects. I haven’t used it since. I didn’t try it for very long because I was starting baclofen muscle relaxant at the same time and I got chest pain and it could’ve come from either so my family doctor told me to go off both. I recently bought a self-help book from amazon.ca Kindle edition that I’m so far finding very good. It is called The Bipolar II Disorder Workbook: Managing Depression, Hypomania and Anxiety. Now I’m trying this support group also. I read someone’s post who said she used to be a psychiatric nurse but is now thinking of other work. Well, believe it or not, I have an MA in Counselling Psychology and was a paid eating disorder counsellor for a year before I resigned because of my physical disabilities and chronic pain. I realize that me being a counsellor is the blind leading the blind, so I taught ESL online for a while but I had to stop due to my physical disabilities that affect all 4 extremities. I’ve been hired as an online psychology tutor, but I put it on hold until I can see if my adaptive technology is sufficient for me to do the job on my own or my husband and I will work together after he retires in 4 years. Long-winded aren’t I? LOL

I don't do much besides sleep and I can't seem to find pleasure in anything. I have been battling depression for almost a month and quitting my job made it worse and now it's just crushing.

Hello / reintroduction,"hi! I was on here years ago some of you may still be on! My struggles w bipolar are not new. I was dx at age 46 after a very long manic episode ended w me attempting suicide ,having a mental breakdown and needing to be in a psyc unit for 3 months followed by 5 more hospitalizations in 1 year. I was an RN married and raising 5 young children. I was an absolute mess. Since than I am now happily divorced 6 y my kids are now almost all adults. My youngest still resides w me as a 16yo girl w many many teenage issues plus dx w BP this year. I have gone through a lot emotionally and physically. 
Its been a long road. I have the kind of illness that just doesn't respond to any medication. I stay depressed for years at a time w no reprieve. I get very bad side effects and can't take for long. 
I relocated to Florida from Long Island NY 3 y ago. I thought it would be a miracle cure w no winters no cold and plenty of sunshine. I wound up in a psyc unit with in the first month. 
It took almost 2 1/2 years to acclimate to Florida and find the right Dr s and medication. I am happy to say that through my new PMD and psychiatrist they took me off a whole bunch of meds adjusted my thyroid med and got me on the right meds w feeling better I was able to begin exercising walking enjoy the outdoors and find joy again. 
I was taking 7 different meds none of which worked and my thinking was so messed up anxiety depression TD unbalanced ,falling 
I now only take 200mg of Effexor,20mg of Latuda ,Mg ,D3,hydroxyzine for IC and Amour thyroid  
I am happy to be back. Look forward to reconnecting and making new friends

Chronic fatigue.,"Anyone else deal with this? It’s been near a month since it started. Around 7pm every night I feel exhausted and ready for bed. I go down to my room to read a book or watch tv for an hour. I take my meds at 8ish. Yet I can’t fall asleep till near midnight.
i am compensating for the low energy by drinking copious amounts of caffeine which is probably why I can’t fall asleep at night. I saw my dr a week and a half ago and she ordered bloodwork. I called today and dr hasn’t received the results yet. 
Many wise words? I plan on stopping all caffeine intake starting tomorrow ",bipolar-disorder

Finding support,"When you’re first diagnosed, anytime you’re in the hospital, they drill it into you to build a support system. I always had one in my family, but lately no one has time for me. I ask to hang out and I call and text, but no one has time for me. 
I have serious trust issues so it’s near impossible for me to reach out to new people. I just feel like a burden which doesn’t help my suicidal thoughts and depression. 
So what do you do when your support system isn’t being supportive? I have my therapist of course, but that’s only once a week. ",bipolar-disorder

New Here.,"Hi, I am having a bad day. This is my first post. I usually can tell when I am manic or depressive. I got off my meds in Dec 2018, because I feel easily manipulated by psychiatrists. Today, I finally got the urge to call my insurance company to help me find a new psychiatrist because I am losing my mind. I also asked about support groups and it led me here. While, I was waiting for the list of support groups I was told I would receive an email within an hour. Then four hours later, I had a serious panic attack and could not control myself. My grandmother helped me, but then a lot anger came out. I am a professional at putting on a fake face for strangers, but around certain people I let everything I have out on them. So I dealt with email situation by calling back. Apparently they spelled my first name wrong in the email. That made me even more upset, because I always felt like it is a easy name to spell. Any advice on how to help handle the anger? I have heard many like being manic but I do not. I tend to like being more depressed until it reaches the point where I get suicidal. I have overdosed on my old psychiatric meds in the past. I now still usually get suicidal thoughts and I make it seem so easy to get through them. It is not easy. I tend to either sleep for long periods of time but not at night. I have really bad nightmares and darkness does not help. Not even a nightlight, because my brain still knows it is dark outside. My depressive episodes last months and my manic last a few days. So my nights a usually filled with depressive and suicidal thoughts, most of the time I can numb out the thoughts by staring at a TV screen for hours. When I am manic, I do not sleep for days and I am very productive but my brain gets so chaotic, that I hate the sound of my own thoughts and voice. So while my family is having conversations at the table my brain is constantly either trying to find the perfect thing to say or telling me to shut up, then that causes me to have no idea what is happening and then it leads to the most annoying question ""Are you okay?"" I know somedays I feel that I want it to be asked but majority of the time I like to not have so many eyes on me with that look of worry. I know I am not okay, but sometimes I would just enjoy for Today's Gossip Hour not to involve me. ",bipolar-disorder

Repost of: Dangers of mixing Alcohol and Psych Med,"Because people don't seem to think its a big deal to drink while taking one or more Psych Medications at the same time when being treated for BiPolar Disorder.....
Beer has an ABV (alcohol by volume) of 2% - 12%
Liquor (Rum, Tequila) ABV of 40% - 60%
Vodka ABV of 60% - 85%
Anti-anxiety meds and Alcohol are both CNS (central nervous system) depressants. This causes increased drowsines as well as depressed breathing and heart rate. Because both Anti-Anxiety meds and alcohol are consumed orally, it's also a concern that this slower method of metabolizing these substances can compound the risks of side effects over time, as more of the drugs enter the individual’s bloodstream.
Drinking Alcohol and taking Anti-Depressants causes you to feel more anxious and depressed, it also amplifies the drowziness side effects of most anti-depressant medications.  Since Alcohol is a depressant, your Anti-Depressant medication becomes ineffective when your drinking and once the medication gets off track in your system, you then play catch up the following days to get your system back to the stable chemical balance in your bloodstream.
Its not rocket science, we have a Mental Illness and we take very strong Psychiatric medication to control that Illness, it's not a choice and everyone would change it if we could.  But, choosing to treat that Illness comes with a Responsibility and that means being a grown up and knowing that drinking Alcohol while taking these meds is dangerous and cannot only cause you serious harm but others around you.    You can go out and have a good time without drinking, people do it everyday.....its the safe, responsible thing to do.   Call me preachy, yell at me, whatever....I still luvs ya.   Somebody needs to point this out and I have a thick skin.   Seriously though, it's just meant as education, because I do love all my peeps on here and I don't want to see anyone get hurt.",bipolar-disorder

Eating Habits,"So a little over a month ago I had a manic episode that lasted a couple of weeks and I basically stopped eating. When i got out of the hospital and trying to get back into my normal life i realized that I wasnt getting hungry at all. I have been trying to regulate my eating habits for the past 3ish weeks, but nothing seems to help. I dont get hungry, I have to take zofran just to eat something becuase it makes me so sick, and I usually feel full after only a few bites. I know i need to eat in order for my meds to fully work and i need to stop losing weight but it is such a challenge. Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone have any recommendations?

Crisis - Extreme emotions,"I don't know how to handle these emotions. Just found out a close friend has been diverting all my texts to her friends and who knows who else. One of her close friends repeated an incident that she would have no explicit knowledge about and when I asked her how she knew, she told me that all my texts are sent to her and several other people  Now, I have been sharing my mental health issues with this person over the past year as I felt I could trust her. It took me a year to build up trust and then I started texting and let her come to my Facebook page.  Someone in my large community where I live, shared something with me that aroused suspicion why she would say such a thing to me and how would she know. Now, I have come to believe all my intimate details have been shared throughout this 180 bedroom senior community, no wonder people avoid me.I called the Apple Store and they told me to disable ""AirDrop"" and certain ""Notifications"" to prevent anyone from accessing my contacts and having the ability to do what this woman did to me. I also called a local hotline tonight to set up a friendly caller daily to help keep an eye on me.
There are alot of other major developments in my life. I don't have a psych doc, he retired, so I am looking. I am not in therapy because I cannot afford this. Going thru a bankruptcy and the paralegal who worked on my case quit and left with my file exposing me to identity theft. My psych doc who retired of 30 years copied me on a letter he sent to a psych doc that I since will not go back to, it was cold and I felt betrayed by him. And lastly my cat is very ill. So, alot of people have hurt me that I was very close to and having trouble coping with all this. Debbie

“That’s my place”,"Gmorning and Happy Friday!
in the long road of this illness I still suffer from self esteem issues about where I am in life,generally speaking.  I’ve been strong and stable for years now, work full time in a leadership role but never seem to progress any further.  Doesn’t feel like opportunities are there.  I don’t feel there are limitations to what we can do in life, what we can achieve, but when things occur in organizations where positions are eliminated and budgets are cut, etc, I can’t help but feel defeated.  Any normal person would feel frustration, but my mind goes to a place of self doubt over having been beat up mentally by BP and that looming feel of doom.  I’m sure there is a practical way to dissect and separate these feelings but I suppose I’m writing this morning to look for some inspiration.  The people who have excelled and thrived with mental health conditions are probably busy excelling and thriving and not on a support forum, but if there are folks out there, I’d love to hear of your turning point.... where things began to click in place and you no longer had to scrape together money to pay mounting bills.  When did you feel you truly conquered the low self esteem?

New to BiPolar,"I am new to BiPolar, although age 68, I was misdiagosed all these years and it has had catastrophic consequences, now seeing a new psych doc who has had extensive training in major psych hospitals. So far I am impressed with him. He ordered alot of blood work and wants to see me every two weeks for now.  I am now in bankruptcy for a second time in 12 years.  I kept telling my former psych doc that I was spending alot of money and could not stop it, but it fell on deaf ears, he did nothing to help me.
I worked so hard to reesstablish my credit only to be put on a medication a year ago that may have worsened my impulse control issues. 
On new medication now and adjusting to it. Still overwhelmed and depressed.  I seem to spend alot of time managing my mood and it's exhausting.
During the course of paying off my bankruptcy attorney each month for 7 months (going without medical care, veterinary care and food) he contacted me last week admitting that the employee he fired stole my file and all my sensitive documents.  He said to prepare me for identity theft.  He forgave my last payment to him, but refused to pay for identity theft protection, which I had to do. I have been very busy last two days filing out paperwork, contacting every agency to notify them.  It's all been soo exhausing. I have to hope that my bankruptcy will be granted, if not, I'm sunk :(
My 1 year old cat is in need of extensive veterinary care now and I set up a Go Fund Me Webpage, so fingers crossed one of my friends will donate much needed funds. I am soo worried about him.  He's a special needs cat now and has alot of health issues, which has added to the fluxuations in mood and depleating of my funds on hand. I am going to try to see if my vet clinic can work out a payment plan (here I go back in debt again) or I may have to find my cat another home, which I cannot bare to loose him.  My neighbor offered to pay for his vet care this upcoming week, but I had to say no as that would ruin our friendship. 
My former psych doc sent a written letter to my new psych doc and mis-informed everything.  It was as if he was talking about someone else.  I did place a phone call to him in exasperation over this letter, but he is not responding.  He is retiring, I have been with him for 30 years and this was a devastating moment when I read his letter.  He should never have sent me this letter to read what he thought about me clinically... it was cold and cruel which shocked and stunned me.
Started a daily mood diary so I can bring to my new psych doc.  Also using my fitness watch to calculate my sleep.  I find the more time in deep sleep and longer REM times I feel more balanced the next day. 
I need to update my profile, will do that next.
Anything anyone can add to help get me started with this new diagnosis would be greatly appreciated.

Favorite movies,"My favorite movie ""Bladerunner"" (the original one). I think it came out in 1982, staring Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard. I actually read the book too. The movie was better. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg0cmhjdiLs&t=44s

Sean Young was so pretty in this movie. Sigh..... 
I am not liking too many newer movies now a days. Not sure. It seems that Hollywood lost new ideas. I really don't like remakes too much. Sequals are meh too. I normally recycle old movies. Or watch mob movies. Sopranos etc...
Shawshank Redemption was good too. I think the people in ""the business"" call it ""character development"". I find that too many movies now a days relay on high tech special effects. Watching a number of YouTube videos, I think I understand the techniquies behind shooting film. (or digital now). ....the panning, zooming etc. DOF (Depth of Field). Ken Burns effect. I think Ken Burns is a director that developed certain methods of moving the camera etc... 
I feel I have still photography down pat. Video, on the other hand is more complicated. I apperciate good cinemotoghery (sp). Not only do I watch  the movie, I kinda try to understand how and why they move the camera why they do.

I've tried encourage him to go to bed early and put an alarm but he likes to read a lot and then ends up staying up late even if we went to bed early. And if we put an alarm for 9 or 10 am, he snoozes it soo many times. He now leaves the house between noon and 2 pm (though, to be fair, I am have bedridden for the last two months and has had to help me a lot). I feel terrible for not being able to help much with chores like cooking, cleaning and feeding our 2 cats. I'm sure my temporary illness hasn't helped his.I was wondering what can I/we do. Has anyone tried a medication that help with oversleeping? I know he oversleeps because he is tired, but he was already oversleeping before I became bedridden.

Just had a med tweak, the pdoc increased my Celexa. I think it's helping me be more clear-headed, at least it seems that way. I'm on Clozaril and Zyprexa for auditory hallucinations. I heard them the other day after I got home from a visit to one of my sisters. I thought about taking a Haldol but, I was able to wait them out. My oldest sister Charlene (not her real name) was in a foul mood today, and said I need to find another doctor. She just doesn't understand. Unfortunately, psychiatry isn't an exact science. I've felt like a guinea pig at times, let's try a little more of this and a little less of that etc. I like Dr. P, it isn't his fault the med changes don't always work. So the Celexa is working but the Clozaril isn't.
I understand that Char isn't angry with me, she's just unhappy that I haven't met with success with some meds. Char has a lot of physical pain from arthritis and diabetic neuropathy. My pain is all mental and emotional. I try not to get angry at God, because a mental illness can definitely interfere with my communication with Him at times.

It was the first time I ever went. I've been diagnosed since my early 20s. I'm now 34. My feelings range but I'm just lonely because I dont feel understood from my husband. It's been hard explaining to him what i have been going through. Thanks! ",bipolar-disorder

New to group,"hi.  So I recently seen my psychiatrist and she feels I have bipolar II tendencies.  I've already been diagnosed with BPD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, PMDD, and an ED.  What more can I take!  I was looking for some help finding reliable information and some support with my new journey. ",bipolar-disorder
Feeling presured to work,"I've been on disability for about a decade now and I often get subtle signs that other people think I should be working. I find it quite hurtful. Nonetheless, it makes me question myself. Do I have a moral obligation to try to work in spite of my mental illness? I know others who have it about as bad as me and are still able to work. Perhaps I'm on the borderline between able and unable. What I do know for sure is that I am miserable when I have a job. I worked from the time I was 16 to about 21. I hated every minute of it. I hated it even when I was hypomanic. When I was in a depression, I would sometimes fantasize about killing myself after work. The last job I worked at fired me because I asked to go home because I was so depressed that I couldn't handle it. I was still under their 90 day probaitionary period for new hires. My girlfriend at the time convinced me to admit myself to the mental hospital. I got out after a few days. a day later I cut my wrists open. they took me back in and helped me get on disability. The thought of going back to work is almost unbarable. I'm so much happier now. I have almost no stress in my life which keeps my BP from getting too bad. People see me all happy and well put together, so they question my need for disability. Even after telling them what I've written here they still question. What do I do?",bipolar-disorder

Why are meds always the answer?,"So i was pretty recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Pure OCD, on top of the anxiety and panic disorder i already had, and i was put on meds to help. Its been a lot of trial and error and we cant seem to find a med that works but my Dr seems to keep raising my doses and putting me on more meds. I am prescribed to take 5 different meds to help which is about 18 pills a day. I am really struggling to keep taking them becuase they dont seem to help and there are so many to take. Has anyone had this problem? Should i try to find a new dr?",bipolar-disorder
Do you question every mood?,"Of course I spent two weeks in a black hole. The last three days with the sunny weather brought in a sunny mood. I question all of my moods. What was my trigger? Why am I sad? Why am I angry? Why am I tired? Why am I happy?

Felt Good Today,"This does not happen often as I seem to be too depressed or anxious to see that it is sunny outside.  I went to yoga this morning.  This is my third class since my heart problems  (last class was two years ago).  Very relaxing.  The instructor does the same routine so you can learn the moves and not have to concentrate on what's next.  That reduced my anxiety a great deal.  The drugs were really screwing with my balance and depth perception.  Hard to do yoga (or drive) with that.  And lastly, the class was very freeing and supportive... was also in the nude.",bipolar-disorder
Starting to get really lonely,"I've been single for over a decade now (I'm 32). I find it almost impossible to meet people I am interested in. My standards are not high as far as I can tell. I've shown dating site profiles of women I've messaged to friends to make sure and they say my standards are normal. My best guess is that women just aren't all that interested in a guy that lives on disability. I don't mention that I am bipolar. I figure that anyone that is interested in me would ask about why I'm on disability and I would tell them. the thing is, I never get responses. on one dating site alone I messaged more than 50 women and got zero replies. I don't want to lie. I don't want to pretend to be something I'm not. I don't plan to risk my mental health by trying to work so I have money for dating. There are so many women out there who don't want to be alone, who have the same interests and values as me. is that not enough? must I also be the bread winner?

Trying this online thing...,"So, im new to this online support and therapy thing but I figure I dont have anything to lose...all I had (have) to do is get off the sofa, get out of my apartment, sign up, share and see if anyone replies...
So my condensed story is that for some time I have been struggling with the fact that I may be bipolar (or I have frequents bouts of depression)...I am totally in denial, totally ashamed and havent shared this with anyone except my counsellor. Since I was a kid I knew I was different...weird...I had a bunch of weird shit I used to do, I would ruminate over things, I was shy tho I like to seek attention sometimes...fast forward to being hospitalized and being diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety and ocd...I couldnt understand why my moods would go up and down, so ofte, almost regular and like clock work, it always came back...through mindfullness I became even more aware of my symptoms and was later diagnoses as bipolar.(by two different doctors)
Since last yaer, I have been going up and down, and right now Im just trying to get back to *normal after last few weeks of being down...absolutely no motivation to go out, walk my dog, I could stay on my sofa all day and only get up to eat and pee...I feel pathetic, worthless, shitty, I know Im isolated, I know I want to be well, happy and out socializing, I just cant get out, some days im paraniod to even leave home because I think i look weird or ppl are watching me...my head is so full of shit...I watch tv, youtube and eat and sleep and im happy but I know its not good....I am in crisis  right now and usually  have a lot of thoughts of killing myself, but wont, i just feel numb...This is the first step for me, starting to get thing out instead of internalizing...",bipolar-disorder

A lovely afternoon/evening. add some good things,"On Friday I had a lumbar/mri and when I got there every person I had to deal with was very pleasant and responded to my smiles with smiles of their own. then I had lunch in the hospital restaurant (they have a healthy food theme) where the food is amazing I got a small portion which was still too much for me so I had enough to take home and had a delicious dinner too.
I did grocery shopping and then went and bought a new sun-lounger as my fifteen year old one finally gave up the ghost. The first one I bought was almost identical to my old one with no cushion. Then I went to another store to pick up some other food items that I can't get where I live. There I spotted another one which came with a full length cushion at the same price. I bought that and then went straight back to the previous place and returned the first one.
I arrived home to see a beautiful pot of primroses outside my door. I sat in the car in delight just admiring it for a few minutes. It perfectly rounded off my good day. No note, no indication of where it came from but it makes me smile every time i think of it or see it. I am on a quest to find out who left it to thank them!

It's very calm now .Too calm, it's almost depressing. Lol

I have no friends ,it's too difficult to maintain lasting relationships for me. So I fill my time occupying myself with as much art, games ,walking around, prayer, etc. 

My future goals would be to get off of SSDI with a programming or computer science like degree .A boring desk job sounds like nice stabilized job for me.

Mania and Depression,"So I was misdiagnosed with depression in 2006, and finally diagnosed with bipolar in 2015. I believe this is the right diagnosis.  So, I don't know why but I haven't been very good at regularly taking me medication,  which is stupid because they work,  and I know better. 
Well,  I have stress in my life. As we all do.  But I have lots of new things going on,  new job, getting married,  and going back to school for my master's.  While this is good stress I'm worried it may be a trigger.  
I feel manic and depressed at the same time.  Homework takes me longer to focus.  Work is ok but I work rotating shifts,  meaning some nights.  My wedding planning is stressing me out.  
Just wanted to talk it out.  Not really feeling better.  But hoping to soon.

Update on cbd oil.,"I remain astonished and appreciative of the benefits to a life free from suicidal ideation (having had forty years (which included 20+ of despair inducing failures) with it haunting my every step. 
side effects:  1. a slight headache after half an hour which recedes if I do whole body relaxation and deep breathing. 2. almost constant hypomania that I have to be very vigilant with constant monitoring of the slipping into rapid speech, grandiose thinking etc. (you know the drill!)
3. Huge improvement in mood but as yet no pain relief. I have a different type ordered which is tailored to relieve pain. I will see if it works. Hopefully it will arrive this week.
4. almost complete remission of IBS (diagnosed in 2008).
5. steady reduction in med induced bloating and fluid retention I am heading back towards my size 6 which I am more comfortable with.
6. It is becoming increasingly easier to leave the house having become close to housebound over the last seven years, mainly only leaving for doc/pdoc appointments.
7 No self harm which had reared its ugly head again during the past several years.
8. I can watch movies again without feeling nauseous (a fibro thing) so long as it is on my small sreen laptop with the volume only slightly above 'on'.
The original flavour oil is bearable, the cbd/mct mix is vile and the mint chocolate one is the most palatable. I have been watching the site for a bottle of Mixed Berry flavour which i would love to try as chocolate is not really my thing. The best delivery system is sublingual which kicks in within five/ten minutes but it is undectectable in a small amount of (home made) smoothie and that takes 20/30mins to kick in. My current dosage is 500mg/one dropper (1ml) in the morning and another half dose at my usual 'slump time' at between 5 - 7pm.  No help with sleep yet but I am hopeful.
I still take Topamax but have stopped Prozac. I still have my script for xanax prn (as needed) but lately i might only take one in the week, if at all, depending on the things I cannot avoid which cause extreme stress. Even then half the dose works now.

All in all definitely worth trying for treatment resistant BP.
I will keep you posted. I hope this is useful to somebody.",bipolar-disorder

We eventually got out and got the errands done and the weather cleared at some point and the temp dropped to 56, it's like the weather has no freaking idea what its supposed to do.  I don't care, tomorrow it's to be Sunny and a perfect 74 and I will wake up Happy and be on University Lake in my Kayak, in my peaceful, stress-free, happy place!  If I could bottle that it would be my ""BiPolar med""....in a perfect world.

Karma,"so when I was in the hospital a nurse took off my necklace. Allegedly it was put in an envelope and labeled with my name and then sent up to icu with me. But the necklace is now where to be found  The necklace had a panda charm which was the last birthday gift I received from my late nana. My mom was able to remove my rings, also from nana and she put them up for me  
I firmly believe that the necklace is lost because I tried to hurt myself again. I did a bad thing and a bad thing happened.

The Patient and the Passive Aggressive TDoc,"Spencer here again.  I tend to be observed but in a more depressive way which has been a trigger before due to the lack of sleep.  But that is not what I wanted to post.  Do you think your TDoc is human or something that I should judge, and be judged, as the gold standard of information?  I have labored under the notice that she had some insight and that I should rely upon what she is saying.  But she has given me a diagnosis of GAD instead of Bipolar.  I think the treatment would be different.  When I tried to die at my hand, she still said GAD.  Or maybe I am refusing to listen to what she is saying and rejecting her advice because it is negative towards me.  She has busted my confidence four times in 15 months by telling my employer about me in detail and several others.  Some not connected with the medical profession.  This is why I was slow to open up and still have not fully.  I wish that I could trust her, but she always seemed false and judgemental. 
The last session with her was this week; she said that I was lying about my psychoanalyst testing of two weeks ago.  She stated that it was quite the performance and then moved on.  That was the first thing she said in the session.  The rest was just her unloading every little statement she wanted to say.  Very passive aggressive and not helpful for me.  On the psych-testing, I gave full and truthful answers to every.
I wonder if anyone can follow this train of thought.  I get the feedback from the Testing next week.  I tried to call the doc to see if that was his impression or was it just the TDoc clawing at me again.
I am so tired of military medicine.  I think that I have not gotten good care yet.

My job is winding down,"I got this really good work from home job in August. However as soon as I started, I think it may have triggered me and sent me to the psych hosptial for 7 days. 
A week ago, my boss kinda let me know that my work performance was not up to par. My boss K is a nice guy, and hired me knowing I had a mental issue. So rather than burden him,  I decided to resign. I feel bad, it was a good paying job and I was working from home. 
So I am hoping to get paid one more time. That would be really helpful. I am kinda down, but relieved that I don't have the pressure on me. I am thankful that I only have $200 dollars debt to my name. I was never a home owner, so I don't have a mortgage. I owe my parents $15K for a car loan they paid off for me. I have a new car, which I like. I am happy for that. 
I really would like to work for myself as a graphic designer. The problem is finding enough clients. I suppose the competition in Graphics is hard. There are people in India doing really good work remotely, for not that much. I know its a competive field. Also creatives I feel get taken advantage of alot.

"Am I ""Code Switching?""","The non-linquistic definition for ""code switching"" is:
the   modifying  of  one's   behavior,   appearance,   etc.,  to  adapt  to  different   sociocultural   norms.
I'm not entirely sure this is the correct term for what I am doing, but it's the closest thing I could find. Hopefully one of you might know more. I find myself acting or actually being (I'm not sure which) a different person to different people. I don't mean to say that I give a different name or otherwise lie. I simply have a different personality depending on what group of people I happen to be around. With my family I am a cynical jokster. with the elderly whom I play cards, I am an upbeat optimist. at the bank and other businesses, I seem bored and curt. I slip into these other personalities with no thought whatsoever. I can't tell if I am ""acting"" differently or if I am actually ""being"" the person I present myself to be at any given moment. another facet of this thing I do is that I almost never show my true emotions, and even then they are muted. Only deep depression and hypo-mania show through, and only just enough for others to barely notice a difference. People are always so surprised when I tell them I am BP.

Working and Bipolar,"Hi, I am new here, this is my first post.  I was wondering how others with bp manage their careers. I was hoapitalized last week with a  bipolar 1 mixed depressive state with mild psychotic features.  I am scared to go back to work because I don't want to overwhelm myself too soon and end up back in the hospital.  I am also scared if I do not go back I will become more depressed and isolated and feel worthless.  I worry about stigma and what others would say if they knew where I was last week, especially since I am a public school teacher in charge of supervising other people's children.  When I am healthy, I am a talented and reliable well-loved professional.  Right now I feel like I'm a mess.  Any thoughts or suggestions on how to balance this disorder alongside a career would be helpful.",bipolar-disorder

I resigned today,"I resigned from home today. I am 47, live at home with two very nice parents. They are disapointed in me (as usual). I got into this job last August. It was stressful from the beginning. The stress led me to say very negitive things about myself to a past ""friend"" who took it upon her self to call my local police. 
The police came, and ""insisted"" that I go with them. ....fucking goons. So I was in the ER at the local hosptial, I flipped out. That sent me to the mental hosptial for 7 days. I managed to stay quiet in that place and hated those fuckers. The food sucked. They kept screwing up my food orders. 
So I got out, resumed the work. G and K were nice, but I could not get my head around the job. I was talked to by K recently. K is the owner. He said my job performace was not there. So I thought about it, and decided to resign. 
I liked working from home, but this job was fucking complicated. I also was not into bathroom items that much. So I have one more month here. Ill work on his website. I hope to get one more check from him. Then cut connection with him. Or if he wants graphics work, I can do that for a fee.
I was having episodes during the stress of not being able to perform at this job. I hate doing a job and getting paid for it, and not doing it well. I rather just not be paid and not work in that profession. 
So now I will have no income in the future. However I have not hung myself. So thats a plus. Hanging would be the way I would go. Dont worry I don't have any rope, and am too lazy to make a noose. I don't even know how to make a noose. 
I don't like guns, and don't own one. Guns are evil. Just venting. When I get depressed I simply just goto bed. Sleep it off. Since its almost Summer, I am happy the weather is getting better. 
The only down side is me quitting, I can't file for unemployment. So I don't have a big buffer. I still owe 15K on a car loan for my parents.  My parents may be able to weather the missing 15K.....I do want to pay them back though. 
I would be pleased as punch if I could somehow construct an at home graphic design job. I just need a client base, a client base that are not douchebags and will pay a fair rate.

Off my meds,"i overdosed on lithium two weeks ago. The hospital took me off all of my meds for an entire week except synthroid. When they finally restarted them they only gave me Zyprexa and Zoloft. 
Ovviously they didn’t want to give me the drug I od’d on. And the Wellbutrin they said can cause seizures and since I have a history of drug induced seizures they didn’t want to give me the Wellbutrin. 
My mom called my psychiatrist who told her he wants to see me as soon as I get discharged. Being today is Sunday the office is closed so I’m gonna call first thing tomorrow and get an appointment. 
I don’t feel depressed. I have no suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to be off my meds too long. Dr told mom he will restart my medication as soon as he sees me.

Where do I go from here,"I need help... to start, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Chronic Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar & lastly in process of determining whether I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm service connected & lately been seeing my social worker once a week. I'll also be seeing my psychiatrist once a month. I'm on so many meds that I don't know what works or what doesn't. 

In the past year I've checked myself in for 72hr evaluation. Recently, I put my gun to my head... (I threw an unnecessary temper tantrum) My mood swings are destroying my relationship with my girlfriend. I say I'm gonna do something then don't do it. I have no want to do anything at all throughout my day. She wants me to get out & meet people. We went to the American Legion for st. Patrick's day & yes I... we had a great time. We discussed me joining the Legion to make friends & do something meaningful with my time. It's been almost a month now & I kept thinking about the Legion coming up with reasons why not to join. My biggest reasons are that I don't want to bury anymore of our brothers & sisters. I've seen too much death & it kills me to think about burying anyone else. Second, I really do not want to do any parades. The crowds make me super uneasy. The only reason I could think of as positive is cheaper beer. That's not a good enough reason... infact, that's the wrong reason to join the legion. This is a cycle, once or twice a month I become mean & intolerable to others. There's much more that I've done hurting those around emotionally. I don't know what else to do short of joining the legion as my girlfriend wants me to do. I don't want to do it just because she wants me to. I want to want it. Am I afraid to? Yes & i don't know why. 

Please... I don't want to lose her. I need help.

Edit: she's pregnant with our baby. She told me she's not keeping it as I can't be trusted. I can't blame her a bit. I want so badly to have this baby with her.",bipolar-disorder
Looking for ways to fill my time,"Im in the slow process of awaiting Social security disability. Im severely bipolar,have depression,anxiety,im basically a cluster fuck of mental illnesses. 
I live about 4 states away from my family with my fiance,Ive tried making friends but everyone wants to go out and do things that involve money,transportation and generally things that I have no access to.  
Ive made a few conversations with a few people but they always fall flat and no one really seems interested in being ""my friend"" so that brings me to this. 
My fiance works 5 days a week,we have zero money to go out or have any kind of social life because of so many bills,So that literally leaves me sitting here week after week struggling to find things to do to fill my time to distract me from the fact that I have no life what so ever. 
Oftentimes I get very depressed because I have nothing to do,people tell me to get a hobby and dont get me wrong ive tried but i always get so bored so quickly ajd get depressed again. 

I just wish I had something to do. Most days I sleep all day and am up all night so that hinders me as well,Ive tried getting my days and nights straight but inevitably they always end up mixed up so Theres no point in even trying with that.
I dont know how to live a normal life and be a normal person,what do people do who dont work,or have any family or friends or even a ride for that matter?

Crises,"Seems like an odd title.  Last week, I read an article about suicide committed by two mothers.  One was searching on the internet about methods.  I started to do the same and fell into a depression in which suicide seemed like the best outcome.  I wanted to but stayed my hand after going to a veteran suicide crises chat line.  I think these feelings come from bipolar, PTSD, MDD and GAD.  I am writing because I can't believe how fast the change was (and dangerous).   I reached out and what I was supposed to do per my therapist.  Note that my therapist does not know, but I meet her later this coming week.  Should I tell her?  She will be disappointed... whenever something does no go well, ""well I don't like that"", or that she will only see me if I not ""playing games"".  I feel like I should tell her but that will probably just bring me getting yelled at by her and no real help will be delivered.  She is on a military base so the reporting standards a less.
Also, I will never go into the ER for SI/SA.  I was taken there after taking pills and that experience left me much worse off and it landed me in the locked ward of a Psy Hospital for five days.  So that is not an option.
So tell her, get yelled at?  Or don't and live the lie.  Which, I do all the time.  I need a human to talk with that can't lock me up.",bipolar-disorder

Heartbroken,Hi all. Just venting. I am bipolar with severe anxiety. My brother (who has schizophrenia) has been homeless for 9 months now. I saw him for the first time in 4 months about a week ago. It just breaks my heart and there is nothing I can do about it. The state had guardianship of him and gave it back to him a little over a year ago. He was homeless within three months. He isn't a threat to himself or anyone else so there is nothing they can do as far as commitment. He is so talented. Our parents are dead so they can't support him. It just breaks my heart into pieces. Here is a man who litterally carries everything he owns in a cart and he never complains. The only thing I can do is let him know I love him and am here for him. It just doesn't seem like enough.,bipolar-disorder
Another Od and admission TW,"I don’t remember leaving work early on Monday. I don’t remember posting here. I took a whole bottle of lithium and a bunch of Zyprexa. I apparently called a suicide hotline who sent the police to my house. I was already unconscious at that point from the overdose. 
I didn’t regain consciousness till Wednesday. I was in restraints and had tubes in my throat to help my breathing. I vaguely remember my pastor visiting me and my sisters being here. Yesterday was more clear. The tubes came out Wednesday. The catheter came out yesterday. I’m still in the icu. Mom brought my iPhone today. 
I have a very foggy memory of what happened. I don’t have a clear memory from Sunday till Wednesday. I’ll be out of work for quite a while. I’ve had a pretty high fever for the last a couple days. As far as 104.1. I don’t really have an appetite but I am drinking a lot of fluids.

A Step,"I finally had the courage to see a psychologist. I've had a horrible childhood, and when my boyfriend moved in and he was showing me he will be there for me, I had to forced myself to change the belief that I wasn't worthy to be love, that I would spend the rest of my life alone because I didn't deserve to be loved.

My mother is bipolar. She made me fearful of life, of love, of people, everything good that would happen with be twisted to something negative, humliating.

When she found out I was seeing a doctor she didn't like it, didn't like the fact that I was talking about my life, about her, to strangers.

I have been afraid of her explosions, afraid of her, I ignored her, ignored it, because I needed something I couldn't even put in words. I always felt and knew she was wrong, knew that people couldn't all be like her, I couldn't allow all the fear I had of becoming close to someone get in the way to finally beginning to live.

Than I question myself thinking if I’m having a hard time now...shit just wait two babies are on the way. I guess I need to talk to my friends and tell them to chill. Trust me I have given them every reason to worry about me but when can you say that happened and I’m better now. I don’t think I will ever live down my old days. It is just different now.

Mood changes,By Saturday I woke up with clearity after my mixed episode and started feeling better then last night I started having self harm thoughts again. I tried to figure out what's triggering them and today I think it was my husband asking me to take my son to the gym while I work out and he goes to the kids zone. Sounds simple enough but the issue was I had just put my son down for his nap and I was leaving in 30 min and my husband wanted me to take him because he wanted a nap and just got his tooth pulled so he can't do much with him. I have been doing it all this last week even going through a mixed episode. I just wanted to go to the gym for an hour with my friend and have an hour to myself.

"FOr parents, and maybe you too?","Last week my sister told me that my nephew told a counselor at school that he wanted to die. THis was shocking to me but I suppose the bad thoughts were only going to esalate as he got older. He has several mental illnesses and is in a class with other children with special needs and behavioral issues. The poor guy is constantly picked on and bullied and has no friends.
Today I sat him down and asked him why he told the counselor that he wasnted to die. He jsut shrugged his shoulders and said sometimes he wants to hurt himself. So i told him that i see a psychiatrist too, that my brain isnt wired right. i told him that sometimes I get really sad too and that sometimes I want to hurt myself too. I wasnted him to know that he is not alone in his battle. I told him that iff he ever felt that way to call me and I would talk to him. I told him I love him very much and hugged him, then sent him back to play. He is 15 but mentally he is much younger. 
DO you think what I said was ok and appropriate?
Im wondering how you parents first talked to your children about your illness. I dont have kids and i dont think I will ever. But someday my young nieces are going to want to know wh I take so much medicine. They watch me fill my weekly organizer. I have told them that the medicine makes my brain feel better, but that my medicine would make them sick.
Someday they are going to wonder why auntie rarley goes to family get togethers, or why I hide in my room when guests visit, why i dont have any friends, why I am a grown up who still lives with her parents.

So this past week I went through mania and I literally felt like the Energizer bunny. I had so much energy, was shaky and figity but unlike my other manic episodes I didn't have euphoria I was angry and irritable and agitated. I actually didn't know I was going through mania, at first I thought it was just anxiety but my husband noticed it and said he thought I was having a manic episode. So i called my pdoc and they had me come in the next day. My pdoc told me I was going through a mixed episode. I realized something was really wrong and it wasn't just anxiety because Monday and Tuesday I was having thoughts of running my car into a tree or oncoming traffic or being irrational and wanting to cut or go get drunk and I've been sober for a year now and haven't cut even longer. So calling my doc was a good decision. He decided to change a med, he took me off Prozac and put me on wellbutrin adding to my concoction of meds of latuda and lamictal ect. 
Then yesterday I crashed. I came down from a bad high basically of taking speed lol so I slept all day yesterday and felt down and today I have been so depressed all I want to do is lay in bed, imI not eating very much (that's when you know something is wrong with me) and imI lacking drive but my husband helped me get up and go to class and I saw my friend and that helped, I feel a little more up beat now. 

Well thanks for reading I'm just scared of myself right now because I had a suicide attempt a year ago but I think I can handle it this time (I hope) ",bipolar-disorder
Too much prozac?,"I am wondering if too much prozac would make you too anxious. I was originally diagnosed with BP1. Now its major depressive disorder. 
I am on prozac and geodon. My am perscrbed 3 prozacs a day. I think 80mg, but I feel that is too much, and am only taking 60mg.
I get my boughts of anxiety and depression still. I am mostly worried about the future. My parents are aging and I worry about them. I know age is something that cant be avoided. 
My aunt in Flordia is 89. I was thinking of going with my mom and dad to visit her, so that I could help out my dad on the driving. However I dont want to take an absense from my work. So I decided that I would stay put and watch the house while my parents went down to Florida. 
This summer, I decided not to go on a West, or Southwest road trip. Instead, I will sit at home and work and try and save money. I think that is the best choice I could make right about now. Anyway I am rambling.",bipolar-disorder
Money Problem,I upped the saving to 3.00 a week. A little at a time I also am paying on the credit cards so that it will be easier to save more. I did buy some blank cards to make cards I caught a sale and it covered the shipping. It costs just as much or more when I go to the store because I have 3 hours to waste before the bus comes to pick me up so it is not cheaper and I spend more when I go to the store. They alwauys have something that I want ,bipolar-disorder
Not doing well at all,"I’m seriously thinking about killing myself today. I’ve been so lonely and I have no one to talk to. I live with the only friends in my area I have, but I’m an outsider in their home basically. I know it would kill my grandma and seriously mess up my dad. I mean I know the rest of my family would be devastated but I know they would be able to continue living. I don’t want to go back to the hospital because it’s really not that effective and it’s not a med thing so a med adjustment wouldn’t really do much. I’m always in a shit ton of pain all the time and I can’t really afford my medicinal marijuana anymore because I left Ethan and don’t have help with it, and I really don’t like pain pills because I get addicted really easily to them. So I’m going to ask one of the girls to give me a ride to pick up the meds I can get and I’m probably going to OD on them. I’m sorry about worrying anyone but I really think this is what I should do.",bipolar-disorder

Change of plan on sex spam,"ok, Mrs Fish has found out that when an account is hijacked it first sends out a bunch of friend requests. Only after adding a few friends does it add the sex spam.
So there is no way of being able to tell if you get a friend request if it's a hijacked account or not. However you should be able to work out that if they have not posted anything for a year or so it may be hijacked.
I have a feeling that a really well known member who hasn't been around for a while has been hijacked. I don't know what to suggest!
After really pushing DS I was told DS are closing the hijacked accounts. If the rightful owners want them re-opened they have to contact DS to do so. I've asked DS to confirm they are actually contacting the people whose accounts have been closed but no answer so far.
I also asked DS to put something up on the boards themselves rather than ""we are looking into it"" but again, nothing so far.
I have made a note of the accounts you have reported but for now I'm not sending them in. The hijacking has not ended - it's still happening and I think at an increasing rate. I'd prefer DS spend time working on sorting the root cause and stop the bot first.
You can probably tell I'm pretty pissed at DS (after having a history of being pissed at them).
Jan and I are constantly in contact and we will keep monitoring stuff and keep you informed.

Bad day,"Can't stop shaking. Feeling bad. My head keeps going to dark places. I was holding it together, barely but I was doing it. I don't know what's different about today but I'm filled with fear.

Managed to have some soup and kept it down, fighting every urge to bring it back up. Hate that this is my life. I don't know how to get through the fog.

Broken hearr," I took my nephew to his psychiatrist today and my sister called in the middle to talk to him. She said on Monday my nephew told the counselor he is depressed and wants to kill himself. My heart is breaking for him. This child(15yrs) has behavioral issues and adhd, ocd, oppositional defiant disorder. He is on so many meds. I love him dearly. He isn’t clever enough to figure out how to actually hurt himself but just that he is having those thoughts breaks my heart.

Iv tried to eat everyday but am still finding it difficult. I slept all weekend and manged to reset my sleeping pattern so I'm at least awake during the day instead of sitting up all night. Still very fearful of any kind of social interaction that I'm not comfortable with which is making life hard. My concentration is increasing and the shaking has been less, I think diazapam is helping with that. Still having moments of great dispair and getting upset at everything / anything. My head can't stop going to a dark place but I'm finding I'm able to come out of the spiralling thoughts without it going to such a crisis point where suicide is an option. Last week I couldn't have said the same everything felt so final. This week has definitely has had dark moments but I survived",bipolar-disorder

After losing my best friend I never wanted another friend but it was like she knew exactly what I was doing and she just opened my heart again. 
Why im writing is to ask people to tell people always make sure the people you love or care for know exactly what they mean to you.  I don’t understand why people cut but my friend cuts and luckily she was found so she is getting the help she needs.  I need to read about cutting if anyone who is reading this and they don’t mind if they cut maybe I can understand it a little more.  I’m scared for her she is the most compassionate person I know like i said I wish she could see this too.  Also if you could say an extra prayer for her I would appreciate that and I’m sure she would be grateful too.  Just if you care about someone make sure they know how important they are in your life.

Training a girl and my anxiety,"training a new girl at work. She allegedly has an anxiety disorder and a job coach follows her around while we work. Weird but ok. This girl has the attention span of a fly. Not sure how much she is taking in. She seems to have unlimited energy but wants to talk about everything BUT the job. She has no concept of personal space. Hugging residents and asking them to dance. I find that inappropriate. Then she was standing so close to me that I had to ask her to back up. She drove up my anxiety.

TERRIFIED,"So I start a (another) new job on Monday. Today is my last day at the job I've been at since early February. I had to find something else because wasn't making enough to live on.  I couldn't afford to pay my rent. I was about a month away from being homeless.  I really liked the job, but I need a roof over my head. 
I was fired from the job before that (in February as well as several others since 2015) due to ""not catching on fast enough"". I am TERRIFIED of another failure. When I told my dad I found a better job, he really hurt me. He said ""are you going to be able to do the job""? When I asked him what he meant by that, he rubbed my nose in my job failures. I'm already feeling insecure enough and him saying that was a low blow. I haven't really had much contact with him in almost a week because of it. 
I don't know what I will do if I fail again.  I'm TERRIFIED by it. Any advice?

What bothers me though is that it doesnt seem to bother him that he gets stuff wrong that I tell him even though I tell him over and over again session after session; and that his responses have nothing to do with me because he's not understanding what I'm saying to him.   It's so frustrating and makes me very angry to not be heard or understood where I need to be the most.",bipolar-disorder

...and More Problems,"That job at Fred Meyers I toll you about.  I might loose it because my background check won't go through.  I have never been arrested or in jail.  They said it was because it shows that my ssn was issued in 2001 which is way after the year I was born.  I told them that around the time I got divorced and went back to my maiden name.  That didn't clear things up.  I look up my credit history and it doesn't show that someone stole my identity.
I was told there was another applicant they're having the same problem with.
It's always like this for me.  I can't get ahead because I was dealt a bad hand in life.  My whole life is filled with disasters and disappointments.  I hate my life!  Rarely has anything gone well for me.  Everything has been a struggle.  I want to know what people with good lives, friends, success and love have that I don't that keeps me from having these things.

my son,"I have anxiety and depression myself. I have a 23 year old son that is bipolar. He got dignoised with ADHD at age 5. The school said if I did not get him some medication so that he can sat down to do school work then he was getting kicked out. I had some rocky years till he turned 14 and then it got bad. I had to put him in metal hospital for sucide.He admitted he was sucidal. They really didnt do any thing for him. Now he is 23 living in my home. i buy his cigarettes because if he doesnt have them he punches walls in the house. When he gets a job he loses them because of the add he forgets the small details. I can relate because I do too.I have add also. The problem is I cant get him to do anything not even study for his drivers lincenses. He can drive good. I kept telling him to call about his GED. He told me that he was grown. Then later when I quit reminding me it was my fault.when he got sucidal I called mental health out here and police came too. They only listened to him and he lied and at that time i was mad because he was telling me what I can do and not do in my own house and cussing at me. I even told police he was smoking pot and he is addicted. Ive never seen nobody addicted to pot like him. They still didnt do anything.even though the pipe was there. Then to make matters worse police officer knew my rent man and later he told me if I called police back out here then i had to move because he doesnt want that kind of thing here. At mental health they wont give him adhd meds because he smokes pot even though I can get records from age 5. He really didnt want adhd meds but i convinced him to get them and then mental health said no. When we were in another state and they drug tested him he has so much TSH in his system that they put him in drug rehab at least they did that but when I seen him he was on worse drugs than pot and was jerking. Pot is the only one that he will do becuase he is already hyper and he wants something to bring him down. Nobody wont really help me because he is an adult but they wouldnt help when he was a minor. I think they should do counseling and manidatory classes. None of his friends wont let him stay with them because he doesnt clean up behind himself doesnt work and blows up. This summer I have to move and dont want him on the streets but also dont want him to take over my house again. beating up my house. Sometimes i think about just leaving because I dont know what to do and dont want to wtch him self destruct at same time, Im all he has and dont want him to commit sucide. I also have a 10 year old son. He also has a daughter and the mom is bipolar also but she asks me to get him help then says Im his enabler and i am but i dont know what else to do. she says she got turned down for housing because when they lived in housing he punched a whole in the wall.

What do you do . . . .,"What do you do when you find your therapist woefully inadequate and even disruptive of the therapeutic process?
I dont believe he's even a licensed therapist or a psychiatric social worker.  I think he's one of those Catholic Social Service workers who they use as therapists.
And as time has worn on, I've become horribly frustrated with his inadequacies.
Trouble is I'm part of Mercy Life here in Pennsylvania and I have to use their therapist.  There are no choices.

Continuing to make ‘asides’ to myself,"Well, I've kind of taken it for granted now that I will always be making nasty little comments to myself at a whispering level when my toxic feelings are engaged.  I can only hope - and pray - that I don't take it any further.
On the other hand, I've also on a couple of occasions been successful at controlling myself and stopping myself from making comments out loud directly to people who annoy me, and this self control is a completely new thing for me.  I felt really good about it.
Am hovering pretty well at 75 mg. of Seroquel although it doesnt stop me feeling irritated but maybe is giving me that little bit of help that enables me to control myself at critical times.",bipolar-disorder

Amazing Day!,"I saw John for the first time since December 17th. It was Wonderful!! When I got to where he lives he had a huge grin and smile on his face. I got out of the car so I could give him a hug...he picked me up Off The Ground and swung me around. We went out to lunch, did some shopping....all nice chatter. Nothing like helicopter Mom, no advice, no telling him what to do...just fun.
The only bad part of the visit was when I went to the eye glass place to check out prices etc..I was there with John for just about 2 hrs and the guy was driving me nuts...so bad John had to leave and go outside...I ended up just saying I'm done and left.
Then we went home, John opened up his Christmas gifts and was Very Happy. We just chilled out, had dinner and I drove him back around 6:30pm. Leaving him off I told him call me if you want to come over and if I'm not doing anything we can come home, or depending on how much time I can go up to see him...it's about a 30minute drive.
It's a good start :) and I'm feeling happier than I have in a very very long time!",bipolar-disorder

I shut it off and beg five more minutes. Even with the sunlight coming through the windows a put my head under the pillow.

Wait till you hear this !!!," It's been awhile since I've posted anything.  But this I think will definately spark your interest.. Please forgive me for some graphic words I may use cause I have to to get the point across for the sake of the truth.  I went to Churchill Cornersburg Ohio for a mental health agency, now I find that ironic cause thats exactly what I DIDN'T get.  I had this great therapist for about 2 years.  She did alot for me.  But after I left her her attitude totally changed about me.  One time the door opened to the offfices down the hall.  I saw Jen and said ""Hi"".  She started screaming ""Who is that... Who is that!  I never did anything wrong.  Then later on I horrificly discovered what she meant by that.  She used to brag to me that her husband was leuitenant of the Youngstown Fire Department...and that she was from a posh town in Ohio.  She was implying I was a nobody.  Then one time the guy I got from the same agency after her asked me if I masturbate.  I thought it was o.k. to ask someone that cause therapy has to be intimate but when I told my friend about it his wife was a case manager she said they had no business asking me that.  I once told Jen I watch adult films but I never mentioned the word ""masturbation"", I know better than that.  So this guy brought up masturbation again and he asked me ""you didn't tell Jen you masturbate did you?""  Then another time he said,""I have an issue to talk to you about,""jen said you where following her around the mall"".  I had know idea where he got that.  One time after a session with Jen she made me mad.  As I was leaving and walking away from her she said ""see you next time ...take care.""  I ignored her on purpose and didn't say anything.  This comes into play when I was with the counselor after her.  When I left this guy he just happened to be in the hall the first time after I transferred to a different counselor.  When he saw me walking down the hall he said,""Hi john...I said hello"". I started ignoring him too then I got scared and turned my head off to the side,and I know I looked scared,and said,""Hi"" at the last minute.  So I see Jen at the mall,she walked out in front of me, I said,""Hi Jen""!  She turned her head off to the side and looked scared on her face and said,""Hi""  After it happened I wondered why she looked scared why would she be scared of me.  Then I remembered how I looked at the agency.  Then I found out that she was mimicking me being scared and she followed ME around the mall.  I was like ""I had been set up for a prank by both of these so-called therapists.""  I'm pretty sure this is what happened because the next time I was at the agency when I walked through the door Jen was at the window looking at me and said,""Hi"" with this look on her face like Ha Ha I got you.  I apologized for ignoring her when I was walking away from her I thought she let it slide.  The guy I had after Jen,when he accused me of following her around the mall, kept saying in a threatening tone,""Don't worry about it...Don't worry about it"".  The last guy I saw was even worse.. He also started coming off threatening after some time.  He would say things like,""I know people who have went to jail for that"" and How bout you do voluteeeeer work How bout you do volunteeeer work.!! So I stopped seeing the guy cause he was acting shady and he just happened to show up at Donkin Donuts where I hanged out before work.  When he saw me he said,""You staying out of trouble John"".  I went up to apologize to him and said I was sorry ,he just glared down at me and angrily growled,""You call!!!""  cause I didn't call off the apointments,I didn't trust him.  Then one night,when my friend was over my apartment, the cops showed up at my door.  I just got done telling my friend,""Somethings not right here Joe, theyre acting weird.""  They asked to come in and I let them in.  They said,someones concerned about you.  They asked me what I was watching on t.v.  We were watching a comedy movie called,""Dazed and Confused"".  I wasn't doing anything wrong , my mood was fine . I wasn't suicidal and I wasn't violent.  It really enraged me because I work hard for my money with two disabilities then I get treated like this.  The cops were somewhat nice, they said I wasn't in any trouble with the law but someone could have told them ,""I'm worried about him"" but meant for them to scare me, and that's just what it did.  I called help hotline and said I'm going to jail.  Thank god I got a good lady and she calmed me down.  It was really scary.  She said, ""John, you're not going to jail tomorrow.""  I loved these therapists like they were my family, cause I left my biological family.  They and my friends are all I have. I bought Amil a greetings card when I first met them.  They implied I'm a hipster.  Jen's husband, when ever I saw him in public ,was wearing a black baseball cap like me.  Amil was wearing an earing like me and it looked really awkward on him.  COINCIDENCE. I apologize for the long entry.  Please I would like to hear all your thoughts about what happened to me..",bipolar-disorder
Update,"I saw my old pdoc. She looked at the EKG that caused Dr. Ratchet to flip out and RIP all of my meds away from me. She agrees that not being on Celexa is a good idea, but decided that it was ok to go back on the Seroquel. She said my EKG was only SLIGHTLY off and also had me sign a release so that she could look at prior EKGs from before I was on the Seroquel. She put me on Lexapro for an antidepressant.   I took the Seroquel last night and I slept a little better, but still not great  ",bipolar-disorder
wolfgang shouting at me.,"apparently on sunday night while dreaming i woke him up begging him (or whoever was in my dream) not to hurt me and kept repeating it. he knew i was a asleep but still took it personally and kept shouting at me to wake me up which terrified me even more and i became almost hysterical in tears. he kept telling me to shut up that he wanted to go back to sleep and turned away from me. i left the room and continued to cry outside. yesterday before i left i asked him why he had not comforted me and been kind which is what i would have done. he said 'well sorry, that's the way i am when i am woken up being accused of hurting someone' i just told him i was totally confused by his reaction which really sent me into a deep depression and i left for home. I had an appointment with tdoc this morning that i had to make. it went well but he does think it is time i broke up with wolfgang who since his heart thing in particular has been doing a lot of shouting at me which terrifies me. i am completely confused. i booked a holiday for us on the 2nd april in costa brava and now i'm wondering if i should cancel it.  don't know what to do really.

Wales is a wonderful country with it's own language, many great actors, writers & singers (Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Sheen, Dylan Thomas, Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey etc etc). It also has 45% of the world's rain.

hospitals here - waste of space.,"I had a bit of a meltdown in a store in one of the nearbytowns on friday and they brought me in and gave me tea and water etc and were very kind. next minute two cops arrived, the store security had spotted the cuts on my arm. they took me to the station (arrrested me) under the mental health act and insisted i be seen by a doc. stupid doc came and wouldn't take my word that i was not going to kill myself, that the cuts were self harm not a suicide attempt and sectioned me for 24hrs. cops took me to a hospital in another town to the psych ward where i was admitted and held overnight. they were so overcrowded the bed i got was a temp one down the centre of a four bed ward. i accepted all that happened calmly and politely and they were all very nice. I was interviewed by a junior pdoc and told her the absolute truth and the sh, the suicidal ideation, being manic for the last week or so and so on. anyway stayed the night and as usual did not sleep at all which the nurse was amaed by because apparently, i looked 'very bright and fresh/'. saw senior pdoc who said 'looking at you here, you do not need to be here , you look calm and ok so you are discharged'. I had to lie to them that i was being collected and escaped. managed to get 100euro emergency money from ATM (my wallet was lost/stolen the night before in one of the stores). had to pay 50 euro to get back to my car and then came to wolfgang's. i sh'd again last night. they should not have let me out. they are a bunch of idiots and completely ignored all that i had told them. it was a lovely, safe night in the ward where i relaxed for the first time in months.
apparently a new pdoc has been assigned to my area so i hope to christ he is nice and i am going to try and see him as soon as possible.
my daughter was also a total bitch to me on the phone when i rang her to do the computer work needed to get the emergency funds released and actually said 'you are not the only one in need you know' my response was 'my god i have been there for you for all your needs all the time.' so she hung up on me. i am sorry now i even let her know i had been in the hospital. apparently a sprained ankle or other injuries inspire sympathy from her but being alone and penniless with a sick brain merely made her impatient. i am still stunned.
a friend called just that minute and he had the computer work done in minutes and half an hour later i was able to withdraw the money. he was so kind and would have found some way of getting money to me if the online banking had not worked for him. the difference in the responses was amaing. my son who works in computer tech was also very impatient with me when i called him to do it but it could not be done from a phone. i was about to call wolfgang to do it who i also knew would do a song and dance about it when paddy called and rescued me. good friends are indeed gold.
I did call my (just left) GP an he too was so kind and called back three times to make sure i was ok.

thanks for reading the ramble. I hope i get better help this week or next from the new pdoc. (still no meds, hospital pdoc said she would leave all that to the new guy.).
i will say that the night on the ward did me the world of good and if wolfgang had not been expecting me i would have begged them to let me stay.

I'm trying to find a way now to really 'let go', I told John to tell me if I'm oversteping boundaries. I'm off your back, you know what is right and you know what is wrong. If you want help, ask, if you want advice, ask otherwise my lips are zipped.
John called and we talked and talked, laughed and I'm so proud of myself, I didn't cry...came close a few times but I held my breathing tears under control. I told him how proud I was of him.

I love my nieces and nephews, of course I do, and I don’t want them to rot in foster care, but I do not want to be a parent at this point in my life. I just don’t. It’s not an accident that I am thirty years old with no kids. It is a deliberate choice I made. I want kids someday, but not now. It’s hard enough taking care of myself, I don’t have the energy to take care of 4 kids!!!! And I know it won’t be me by myself, that it will be a group effort between me, myself, and my sister, but I can’t help but be freaked out! I’m freaking out!!! The kids will be here on March 4th, 2019 and I don’t know what to do. I know this is happening and there is nothing I can do about it, but this is a major change. A major change I don’t wanT, but that I can’t avoid. Any advice would be appreciated. ",bipolar-disorder

a bit out of it...,"Sunday night I suddenly had toothache which became jaw ache, then a headache, neck ache, shoulder pain, arm ache and chest pain.
Not that I'd had it before but I thought it might be an infected tooth - so I managed to get to see a dentist who couldn't really see anything but gave me anti-biotics and told me to come back to see my normal dentist because I may need a root canal (oh joy).
But he wasn't happy I had all this other stuff about arm ache and chest pain so told me to go see my GP.
I managed to see her and she wasn't happy either. So I went to hospital. I'd just started the anti-biotics so things started to get a bit surreal.
I ended up with a diagnosis of angina - something I'm still really not convinced about. I picked up the new meds today and noticed two of them (nitroglycerine and another nitrate) will conflict with my blood pressure meds and quietapine. This is after the doctor had gone through all my meds. wtf? Also I got a statin despite a blood test last week that showed my cholesterol was fine.
I'm supposed to get a ""heart scan"" in a month or two but I'm thinking in the meantime they only med I'll take is the asprin.
So I have no idea what is going on (the antibiotic doesn't help clear thinking) other than I seem to have the prospect of various invasive procedures.
I would have asked on the angina board but that hasn't had a post for six months or so...

Anyone here got their bipolar meds reduced ?,"Anyone here got their bipolar meds reduced to nothing after years of being stable ?
I have been stable for 12 years plus because the trigger for my bipolar episodes was eliminated because of my old age. I was eager to get married when I was younger, and got emotionally involved with girls and my mind went wild because of it. That was when I had my episodes. Now that I am 54, and no longer have any desire to get married, did I manage to stay stable for 12 years plus. 
I have been taking lithium carbonate for about 30 years. Now that the doctor at the health clinic said that I have chronic kidney disease made me think that it is best for me to reduce taking my bipolar meds if possible. The doctor at the hospital have changed the lithium carbonate to sodium valproate recently because of my kidney disease. I am staying quite stable on the sodium valproate since.
I am wondering whether there is anyone here who has had kidney disease as a result of possibly taking bipolar meds ? Are you thinking of reducing your bipolar meds as well ? Or anyone here who succeeded in reducing their bipolar meds to nothing now.
Mind you, I am still having an injection of invega sustenna every 28 days and I don't mind having it for the rest of my life.

Since she has text bombed me numerous times with different ever changing resins why she wants a divorce.  When she leaves on the weekends I have to pick up the pieces from our devastated son who is sobbing and shaking as she walks walk the door.

She has been diagnosed bipolar depression, anxiety, and borderline and has been on meds for a week (Zoloft and Latuda)  she's going to therapy and we are trying couples but her message is the same.... I want a divorce and I want to move in with my boyfriend.

I still want her to get better for our son and our family.  I'm willing to o over look the 4 years of infidelity but she seems to have no interest.  I think if we do divorce she will spiral further out of control, and all I want is my wife and family.

"Happy Valentine's Day, everybody!!","This is a general message I am posting to all of the groups I belong to:
I just thought back to when I first found DS soon after it first began and what a different life I had then.  It is much better now, mainly because I have my own apartment as opposed to living in an old travel trailer in somebody's driveway. But even that could have been much worse than it was.  I have been here now since Nov. of 2009 and a lot has happened.  I had a relationship with a man who I connected with like I've never connected with anyone else and doubt I ever will.  Unfortunately although we both battled his severe addictions, he passed away on 9/11/2015.  Since then I have been picking up the pieces and collecting myself to recover from that, losing my oldest son to suicide in 2005, and a miriad of other assorted issues that got shelved and not specifically dealt with along the way in my past and since.  All along I have not been able to find effective resources or solutions to my many ""deep seated"" issues until last year when I found The Tapping Solution on Facebook.  I have spent the last year working on it here and there and this year it is congealing into something solid for me to work with.  Last year when I first discovered it, they were just about to have their 10th annual summit and now getting ready for their 11th one. 
*A note to those in the Bereavement group and others in intense acute pain at the moment:  While this method is effective, please don't expect it to take away all the pain you are feeling immediately. Just as with any physical wound, it takes time for emotional wounds to heal as well.  But this will undoubtedly be helpful to calm your nerves and ease your pain. 
Here is some info about it in case you are interested:
EFT tapping, AKA, Emotional Freedom Technique tapping, involves tapping on a series of certain meridian points on your body while speaking through certain issues you focus on in order to identify and release the negative emotional charges that get stored in your body that can cause stress and pain, and blocks your normal energy flow in your body which can also make you feel tired and sluggish. I started doing it about a year ago when they had their 10th annual summit, and they are getting ready to do their 11th one starting February 25th. They have many people endorsing it, some of whom I was familiar with before I discovered this program, like Dr. Wayne Dyer and Dr. Christiane Northrup who I've seen on OPB, and Iyanla Vanzant who I saw on Oprah years ago when she had her show.
I have been working on it here and there throughout the year and am looking forward to this year's summit. It is structured in such a way that for 10 days, you get an email with a link to several video options you can choose from to watch as many as you want to on different aspects and topics to choose from.  You don't have to watch them at a specific time, you will have 24 hours between each emailing to watch the previous days' videos.  The summit is a great way to learn about how it all works and the different types of styles you can use.  You will need to sign up if yoou want to participate.  If you're interested, check it out here:

Question,"
I don’t really want to go into my history but the major problem I’m having is to learn to trust myself.  I have lost pretty much everything in my life my father (cancer) my husband who committed suicide and blamed me because I wanted a divorce, my job as a RN, my house and my best friend. 
Anyways ever since I was diagnosed and taking all these med I never questioned every stressful moment or just had to pay attention to everything I do or did. I use to be at my best when I was stressed especially at work. The harder or more depressing the case was the more I dove in. I thrived it all. I’m not to sure if it’s all the therapy I have gotten inpatient and out but they all talk about keeping that stress down and how important it is to stay stable. I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s like they are almost saying the best way to stay stable is not to feel...no extremes stay in the middle. The problem is I don’t like the middle I never have but the key is I never questioned myself that I could handle the extremes. Is it the therapy that makes you question every damn thing or is it the meds. I miss the old me. My friends husband is leaving for Venezuela soon and in the back of my mind I take my meds and go see my Dr because I want to be ok in his head. Hard to explain but it doesn’t really matter. After talking to him today I have so much stuff going through my stupid head. One is I’m not sure I can do this without him and the other is maybe see if I can go off my meds. I want that zest for life again If this feeling of getting off my meds is so strong now how is it going to be when he is gone. I realize I need to take care of my mental health because of me and not him but right now in my life I need more of a reason. Can you ever get off meds yea stupid question. 
Does everyone question if they can deal with just the ups and down of life. Do you ever just trust yourself that you’ll be ok no matter what happens in your life or do you live on a damn roller coaster forever. My dream is to get back on that roller coaster but trust myself that you can get off. Hope I making sense to someone who is kind enough to read this. Thanks for your input. Namaste Pema

Alone and Confused,"I'm feeling alone and confused with many conflicting emotions and no one to talk to about them. Now it's been 5 weeks since I've talked with John. I wrote him an e-mail stating I would respect his silence, as a form of communication, and when he's ready to call me...I won't call him.
I found some valuable information on adult asperger depression so now ""I get him more"" and what I saw as lazy, is a form of asperger depression, inertia. Constant fear of doing something, then the anxiety and fear continues to grow into a snowball effect, thus increasing and increasing as procrastination sets in...as John described the inertia to me, ""it's like my feet are in cement""...I continued on with could you take steps...he said ""I want you to stop talking about this""...application for a job...""my anxiety is going through the roof.
My emotional attachment to John, being a helicopter mother to a child with a disability, well it's been a life time occurance for 20+ years and really hard to stop the ""fighting behaviors for services"" and the thinking process and  to let go. I started 3.5 years ago when he left home. Now this time, no contact, is another stage. Thinking about the silence as a 'stage' has brought some comfort...simialr to when kids go off to college. When he first left, we'd talk on the phone every day, some times more, then we went to skyping...then back to the phone every couple of days...progressive decline.
So now, I know the silence is another process for me to learn to let go...to let him be...and to, if he falls, be there to give him a softer landing. He will now Have the ability to fall...I won't be there as a safety net. I've also, to reduce my constant anxiety and worry about him, to believe if Anything Severe did happen to him, the staff where he lives would contact me...I'm his contact person. So this helps.

It’s like if I relax I think to much so I just don’t relax. 
So many things have changed since she is gone. Now her husband is traveling to Venezuela for humanitarian aide he is a Dr plus he can do pretty much anything he puts his mind to. It doesn’t surprise me what he is doing it would of been something they both would do. He has done and helped so much since her death it is so scary that he won’t be around. He asked me if I would stay at the ranch and look over the day to day operation of the property. He has a lot of people working there so it really doesn’t need me.  I get Louise my friends therapy dog when he is gone. She goes back and forth between both of us anyways. I guess I should look at as I would sure be busy so much to deal with on the ranch but the memories just come flooding in. I’m not sure I can deal with it. He realizes my hesitation and is so kind which puts more pressure on me not to screw this up. Trust me I have screwed up so much. I guess me fear is to be still and to actual feel what has happened and trust that my head ont go off the deep end. I just don’t trust myself.. my question can you trust yourself being bipolar. Will that ever happen or will you always be afraid of going off in the ditch. I hate living my life in fear.  Does that make sense to anyone or am I the only one who feels this way. 
Thankyou for reading my rambling I’m just a mess today. Thanks again.

Not OK - Need prayers,"I've been out of the hospital for a week, and my symptoms are becoming unbearable again. I've been hearing voices for the past 2 days, telling me I'm worthless and to cut myself. It's not that I really want to cut myself, but who wants to listen to a Greek chorus prattle on in their head all day? I try doing things to distract myself - I love to read, and the Internet has opened up a whole new world for me, including groups like this one. I always loved to walk, but of course in this part of the country the weather has been crappy.
So here's where we stand: I saw my new therapist today, my second appointment with him. He knows I'm living in hell, and I told him everything I just told you. I have an appointment with a new pdoc tomorrow, and the tdoc urged me to keep that.
Another thing is where I live. I'm desperately unhappy here (personal care home), but I don't know what to do.I'm even sick of hearing myself talk about it.
The tears on my emoticon are only figurative - I haven't had a good, soul-cleansing cry for months - but real enough. My sister, Charlene (not her real name) knows me better than anyone, and she knows I'm a mess. I asked her if she'd be upset if the pdoc decided to put me in hospital, and she said no.
One thing I should mention about my ""home"" - the staff all violate HIPAA all the time. Whenever I've been in hospital, and I see someone I know, I never blab to anyone here about it. But there's no privacy here. I spend most of my time in my room, surfing the Net or reading. They can even hear me walking around upstairs. And the rent is ridiculous.
Char suggested finding another personal care home, and there are a lot of them in this area. I'm worried about moving again after a long time (almost 9 years).",bipolar-disorder

Practice Administrator," Well, I have put a call into the practice administrator at Dr. ratchets office. I left her a voicemail. I’m really afraid to talk to her about this, but I feel it needs to be said. He is not doing right by me. I’m telling him how awful I feel, and all he can do is tell me to go inpatient So that I can get help faster. Ummmmm hello??  He is a Dr.! Why would I need it to go check myself into a hospital when there’s a doctor sitting right in front of me who knows how bad I am? Maybe I’m missing something here?",bipolar-disorder
Lonely and alone,"Today is a rough day, I feel so low and empty. Nobody seems to understand that I am this down for absolutely no reason. I am so tired of being told ""There must be a reason"" ""You can't just be this sad for no reason"". Does this make anyone else feel more guilty for being sad with no reason? It makes me feel as though I am ungrateful for what I have, like nothing is enough..

Is forgiveness an option?,"on Monday I talked to my therapist about my biological father. I endured decades of abuse and neglect at his hands as did my mother and siblings. 
I also talked about my younger sister who I hated with a passion for most of my life. I was able to forgive sister and we now have a great relationship. 
I still after all these years can not find it in me to forgive my father. My therapist says that forgiveness is an option. That it is possible to let go of hate and anger and still not forgive someone. 
I am a Christian and I view forgiveness in a biblical view. if I do not forgive those who have wronged me, God will not forgive me of my sins. According to my faith, forgiveness is not an option but a requirement of me.
So I am asking you, is there someone you can’t or won’t forgive? Is forgiveness an option in your eyes?",bipolar-disorder

Your social skills,"how are your social skills? I never learned to socialize properly with peers. My sisters didn’t play with me very often.

So I never learned how to make friends and socialize with kids my age. And temhat lasted all the way through high school and into college. And at my job I am good at talking about work stuff but not personal stuff.

I wish I could leave this city. Nothing good has happened here since 2010. It has been a constant string of failures and setbacks. And it is a small city too, which means I am always running into some reminder of what went wrong. I don’t know where I went wrong or what I did wrong, but the end result was failure.

Help !,"          Anyone having any experience changing meds and having a nightmare as well ?
          I have been taking lithium carbonate for about 30 years. Recently, the doctor from the health clinic said that I contracted stage 3A chronic kidney disease, but he couldn't pin point whether it was due to taking lithium carbonate. As a result, another doctor from the hospital asked me to change from having lithium carbonate to sodium valproate. I had been taking 600mg of lithium carbonate for one year plus before then. Since 16/1/2019, I have been taking 500mg of sodium valproate but my moods weren't good and I couldn't sleep well at night. I kept having conflicts with my three close friends and one of them stopped talking to me. 
          Is there anyone here who lost their friends or have conflicts with them as a result of a change over to a new meds ?

The WEIRD thing - I have a good attitude!  My body and mind scream NO to vaccumme  and yet I still smile, joke, just a calm attitude.  Thankfully this attitude helps me with acceptance and new coping skills - like everytime a bad memory comes up I now chant ""No Regrets"" and it has helped.   Where do all the bad thoughts come from?  Oh Bipolar = a sick brain.

Dog for sale,"just kidding but this dog is going to kill me. He is crazy like I am.  His wounds just healed from chasing a bobcat. Yes he lost. So tonight he jumps garbage can than on wood pile than over the fence. Next thing I know someone is knocking at my door saying my dog is stuck in the pond. My first reaction was stupid shit save my dog from a frozen pond.  I asked him frantically is he still in the pond and he says ya I’m not getting him and I should be thankful he knocked on the door. I thought I was going to hit him.  Anyways my legs don’t work well sometimes and of course it is one of those days. So I’m falling in the damn snow which I’m not dressed to be out in. I get to the pond and I wasn’t even thinking I just went right in. Those stupid people who do the polar plunge are crazier than my dog and myself. So I grab the dog he claws my face so now I have blood in my eye. I can’t see and I can’t feel anything. How I got him to the edge I will never know. I just pushed his ass up and he made it out. Than he looked at me with this look of pure fear. He was jumping and barking going crazy  I found a spot I could pull myself out of the pond. So now we are sitting far away from the heat because just walking or I should say falling in the house is painful.  The heat hurts and it’s not even hot. 

If I have to go to hospital because my feet are frostbite I’m going to lose it. I just don’t know how long you should wait. I don’t have a lot of feeling in my extremity anyways. I’m doing my best to warm them up slowly but it’s hard when you are shaking so bad and of course my partner is visiting her father out of state. Why does this happen when no one is around. Plus weird thing is I have no clue who that was who knocked at my door. He didn’t come with me to see if I needed help or anything. Isn’t that weird. Who in the hell was this guy and where is he. So besides trying to warm my dog and me up and of course my dog is acting like he is fine except worried about me now I’m worried about this man. I’m more worried about him than my feet and my fingers. I got to go and try to get my feet working again. Sorry for the rambling I’m just a little nervous is all.

No More Hamster Wheel,"First, thank you to all posters who wrote to assist and support me with my Dear Angel With Horns, John. This is the Power of Peer Support working at it's best. Feeling safe enough to put out my worries, and having the feed back, then me responding has lead me to a understanding and a place to begin my own healing.
During WW2 there was a bomber pilot who was repeatedly sent on bombing missions, that rarely did any good....he was exhausted, yet was sent out over and over again and again. 
The Cambridge Dictionary I got my answer. Catch 22
""an impossible situation where you are prevented from doing one thing until you have done another thing that you cannot do until you have done the first thing: a catch-22 situation. Thesaurus: synonyms and related words. Difficult situations and unpleasant experiences.""
What I've not done is to let go of my emotional attachment of trying to """"""control""""  my son, out of my worry for him and his life. 
I'm Totally! emotionally! dependent! around his life and his behviors and his choices. Total co-dependant behavor, trying to control, to fix, save, what is ""not mine"" to control, to save or to fix.
Not easy for a Mom to let go of an adult asperger son, who doesn't 'get' the same info, processing, or maturity of 'typicals'. Yet, I've realized I'm doing what his school teachers did...making life easy for him, being there to fight his battles, and now he's learned there will be someone to prevent him from falling. By not falling, he will not learn accountability and will suffer more and suffer for longer, by not learning a life lesson, if I keep trying to save, to fix, or control the outcome of his life.
Thinking back to Alanon for me, only this time not for healing from the relationship of an alcoholic, rather the continuing symptoms of a codependant that I thought I'd beat...Not! 
Awareness is the first step towards healing. Finding this answer will be my first step, towards a healing process with dear son's and my relationship, and him living """"his"""" adult life.",bipolar-disorder

O?T Dear Son Update,"Well, I'm still struggling, emotionally, not sleeping, gut issues, and the good ole hamster wheel turning at warp speed. My Dear Angel With Horns, I've allowed him to torment due to his silence...Never In 23 Years gone this long without talking...going on 3 weeks. The reason I say I've ""allowed him"" is because my thoughts, feelings, he has no control over, I Do...thus responsibility to change my thoughts and feelings are on my shoulders.
After dancing on his head with spike heels about his health and life style, well lets just say that is the Elephant In The Room which he doesn't want to address. Fear? or maybe because I did that dance trying to get him to go, has gone right under the proverbial rug...which now has a big hump.
Currently 22hrs in his room either sleeping or on computer, 1.5 hrs eating, and the other 15 minutes for you know what...His weight it twice what it should be for his hight, diabetes runs in my family, me kidney disease, cancer and high blood pressure. Oh Joy too he hasn't been to the dentist in nearly 3 years. Exercise...are you kidding...ha ha
He chooses to not see a therapist, although he 'needs' to see one, is in a deep depression..I can relate to his symptoms, as a depression sent me to hospital for an 11day vacation in a facility.
I've made the Very Hard Decision to just let him be, no calls from me, he totally missed Christmas and New Year with me...first ever...I hate it, but what's a Mother to do...tough love sucks! I miss him, I worry about him and the worst I regret the time lost not speaking or doing stuff together...this time will never come back again.
I'm trying to believe this is a good learning lesson for him to seek out the help he needs on his own...65, one bout of cancer, and I'm all he has, so unfortunately...well lets just say, life is short...live each day as if it were your last....personally I Don't Plan On Leaving Any Time Soon!!!",bipolar-disorder

Advice from those who know,"I'm here to try to understand my spouse and to get advice from those who suffer with mental health issues. In short, we've been married 25 years. I have to keep many things to myself because I'm afraid to set him off (so to speak). For years, I've known he's had mental health issues (although I've never said anything to him). My suspicions were confirmed several years ago that he's had numerous affairs, even with prostitutes and strangers he met on dating sites. Without going into detail, he had a bad episode yesterday and I was afraid he would hurt himself. Because of the things he repeats about himself, I'm sure there's some guilt about his promiscuity. He's tried medication for several years, but it didn't help. Sometimes it made his mental state worse. He will do nothing to help himself.
My question: Am I a reminder of his past (or maybe even present) actions? Would it be easier on him if we separated/divorced so that he could start a life with someone new...someone he hasn't repeated lied to, or cheated on, or hurt?
I want to do what's best for him and I truly don't know what that is. I don't want to cause him anymore mental pain by being around him.

I’m new here, but hope to see some cool responses. I was diagnosed with bipolar I exactly a year ago and have had much success with my medications that I’m on. I’m however super ADHD and have never been diagnosed even though I’ve struggled with it since I was a child. I’m in gradschool now and am having so much trouble keeping up with the material and balancing everything. I’ve done everything to cope with my ADHD tendencies my entire life but it doesn’t seem to cut it at this point in my life. Barely making it is not possible anymore! Anyway, I’m thinking of bringing this up with my doctor now that I’ve thankfully been stable for a year, no manic symptoms at all!

Dr Ratchet Appointment," So, I had a doctors appointment with Dr. ratchet today. I told him that I was going to be talking to my primary care doctor about her feelings of me being on lithium because it messes up your thyroid, and I already have a messed up thyroid. He said that he had put in a call To an  Endo chronologist to ask them about that issue. Also, we discussed the fact that the short term Prozac is working, but it is causing me major G.I. issues. He told me to  hold off taking it tomorrow and Saturday and see how I feel mood wise, because the Prozac will stay in my system for several days. If I have to go back on it if I start having with drawl symptoms, then I will. So things are still precarious for me.  And I also saw my primary care doctor. She increased my Synthroid dosage because of my thyroid being low. She said she didn’t think it would be a problem for me to be on lithium even though I have a thyroid problem. So, whatever. And also I found out while I was there that my diabetes has come back. I had worked very hard to lose 100 pounds. When I lost the weight, my diabetes one away.I got down to my lowest point in May, and then I decided that I like to self sabotage, and I put half of it back on and now I have diabetes again. I honestly wish I could just drive my car off a damned cliff and get it over with.

At first it was my back and I had to do to go to a doctors appointment, and now my mental issues today and last week. I’m trying so hard not to screw this up.

IDK,"I honestly don't know how I'm doing this. Going to work, dealing with all new people, b*******. I am tired. And not the kind some sleep would fix. It's a tired I can't even explain. My body and brain have been and continue to go through a proverbial wood chipper in the past 5 weeks.  I honestly wish God would take me. I’m NOT suicidal, but I’m ready to go whenever He is.

Saw Dr. ratchet today,"After feeling like committing suicide the last few days, I took my full dose of Lamictal Last night, I slept like a baby, and I woke up feeling so much better. But I know that I had to go see Dr. ratchet because this is not good. So here’s how my day went. I got up trying to go start my car and it was dead. I had left my light on on Saturday and my battery went dead.  It was like 14 below this morning. So then once I got my car started, I called Dr. ratchets office. I spoke to nurse ratchet, and she tried to say that there were no appointments available today. I turned on the bitch mode. And they were able to get me in at 11 o’clock. So here’s what happened at my appointment. I told my doctor exactly how bad things have been the last few days. He told me he doesn’t understand why I had such a horrible reaction to stopping the lamictal.  I just really had a hard time not laughing at him. I told him I took my full dose last night and he got very angry with me and pretty much told me that if I didn’t stop this he wouldn’t see me anymore. So he increased my lithium, and is having me take 50 mg of the LAMICTAL For two weeks, and also prescribed Prozac for a week to help with the serotonin withdrawal syndrome. He said he doesn’t understand why I am having such a hard time with this. He said “on “you must be very sensitive to medications “”   well no shizzle.. he also said that if I start having with drawl symptoms immediately after I stop the Prozac, that something else must be going on. He said that the half-life of Prozac is a very long time. So if I go three days after stopping the Prozac, and with drawl symptoms came back that it was probably still with drawl. He seems to think that it’s just my anxiety causing me these problems. I don’t know where this guy got his medical license ??  I just I feel so exhausted mentally. And I told him that I REFUSE to go back to the ER and  that I have been through partial hospitalization before, and it’s pretty much a joke. I said to him that he doesn’t understand something. I am all alone. I have no support financially mentally physically or any of it. I just started a new job, and if I lose my job, I lose my apartment, and I’m screwed. And I told him I do not want That to happen, I finally find a job where the people are decent the work is manageable and the pay is halfway decent. I cannot screw this up. So, that is where I’m at right now. I just want to thank everybody for helping me and being here for me. It has really meant a lot, and I hope that when I feel better, I can return the favor to everyone.",bipolar-disorder
Lithium,"i think I forgot to mention that my thyroid is already messed up. I have hashimotos (it’s an autoimmune disorder).

I ate today,"the last time I actually ate was Friday night. I had a couple bites of steak and a couple bites of a baked potato and some baked vegetables. Then I didn’t eat all day Saturday until 11pm and it was only a cup of jello. Then I didn’t eat at all yesterday but at 3am today andither cup of jello. Finally tonight I got really hungry and had a couple bites of soaghettti and some fruit. 
Ive has no appetite at all. It really stinks. I’ve been lying to my mom about not eating so she won’t get on my case. She still has no idea I’ve been majorly depressed for three weeks. While I’m glad she doesn’t know I’m a bit upset that she is that oblivious. She thinks I just have a bad stomach flu. 
Today my therapist suggested I talk to my psychiatrist about going back to iop. I’ve been thinking a bout it and if pdoc agrees, I will call them after my appointment with him. 
I also saw my go today and she is very worried about me. I was afraid she wasn’t going to let me leave without a police escort to the Er. I have a feeling she called my psychiatrist to confirm that I have an atfor tomorrow. She is young and very nice but I just didn’t want to confide in her about my depression. Tdoc said I should tell gp about being physically ill as well as depressed cause it might be something besides depression. But I couldn’t do it. Anyway that was today. ",bipolar-disorder

That being said I was just watching a show on BBC World News about ""intersex"" people.
It was really a positive and optimistic, supportive show. I have to say I am so heartened
to see our society growing to extend the social respect for them. They deserve the respect

"ok, new stuff about spam and abuse","Ok, for a few years now Jan and I have used a tool which allows us to hide spam or abusive posts or replies. Recently there is usually one spam post here a day I hide in the morning.
Many years ago when this first came in, I sought assurances from DS that hide didn't mean it was also hidden from DS. I was told that anything CLs hide, plus anything any member deletes is visible to admin.
Today I got a note through saying they couldn't ban a spammer because I had hidden the two posts and therefore they cannot ban them (implicit in this is that they don't really trust the CLs, but that is probably understandable).
I've written to DS asking them to check. Maybe it's someone new, maybe someone's being lazy or something because for the last 2-3 years Jan and I have been hiding posts and spammers have been banned (and I'm fairly sure they were single post spammers).
Until we get this sorted out I won't be removing spam or abuse - so just be aware of that. It will however all be reported.

An epiphany: There is hope.,"So I feel like I just had a break through.  I’ve been having a rough go of it lately. Like anytime I have down time I think about Self Harm. Tonight was no different. I just started singing a line from my favorite poem, “Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light! I have love the start too fondly to be fearful of the night.”  From “The Old Astronomer” by Sarah Williams.  I wrote it in red ink in my leg, while singing. I then got this idea that I should record it on my phone. So I recorded myself singing it on my phone, and now I’m playing it back trying to harmonize with line over and over again. Its…like an epiphany.  Like….I can use this force of negativity, and turn it against itself. It doesn’t have to be this deep darkness that I am constantly fighting against. I don’t have to give into it. When the urge comes, I can use it as a force of creativity, and inspiration. I can focus on creative outlets, instead of focusing inward on fighting so damn hard. Creativity is a wonderful distraction. And a rewarding distraction. I just feel like self harm has been a shadow over me for the last month. Constantly on my mind, in my thoughts. But, if it is going to be there anyway, I can do something with it. It doesn’t have the right to have power over me. I can take my power back. So maybe when I feel like cutting…I’ll sing. I’ll acknowledge the feeling, then move forward. I feel like…this has given me something solid to cling to, when I’ve just been drifting, clinging desperately to any distraction that I came across. Video games, tv, those work, but they are so fleeting for me. Now I want to sit down at my piano, and develop chords for this melody. I want to write music. Or to at least try. I’ve never been the best at musical composition. But this…this could motivate me to try. I can use this for good, and not let it use me.
 I just want to say to everyone that there is hope. Keep fighting, be compassionate toward yourself. We are all humans, and we all fail. But we can't let those failures define us. We are so much more than out failures and successes. We are so much more. There is hope. A long as we are alive, there is the ability to change. Change ourselves, our cirsumstances, our thought patterns.  As long as there is breath in your body, there is hope. ",self-injury
Wanting to cut.,"So things have been a whirlwind lately. I haven't been on an antidepressant for a month. I've spent that month fighting with insurance, then fighting with my Dr to try and get things to go thru. In that month, I know I've slipped into mania. I have been very volitale and angry. Felt super high energy and restless, and realitively good. Other than being angry. But the latuda finally went through my insurance last week. and I've been taking latuda since tuesday. The thing is, I haven't actually felt that depressed being off of the antidepresssnt.  And once I got off wellbutrin a month ago I haven't wanted to cut. But today, the urge came back. Like I havent wanted to in weeks, and around 10 am today I just got sad, and really want to cut. And it's like..wtf.
I dont know if this is related to starting the latuda, or if I would've crashed without it, but it sucks. I know there are things I can do to distract myself. But the problem is I dont want to do them. And I have no desire to make myself do them, which is worse. I don't want to fight this feeling, but I know if I don't I'll regret it, and end up feeling like a total idiot for giving in. I've been trying to be positive and get out of this funk. I feel like the healthiest thing I can do is take a nap and try to sleep this feeling away. But I'm not somewhere where that us socially acceptable right now. So I've just got to sit in this uncomfortable state of mind.
Honestly, since sleep isn't an option I feel like I've already decided to do it. I know the action hasn't been performed yet, and I can change my mind, but fuck, man.. this sucks.
I'm going to try and distract myself for a while. Maybe take a shower, or go for a walk, or something equally boring...wish me luck I guess...",self-injury

hitting myself,"In the past, I went through a cutting phase, but, over the last couple years, I've developed a tendency to punch my legs, and occasionally slap my face, whenever I'm throwing some emotional tantrum. There are times when I get so overwhelmed, that I laugh hysterically, while crying, and sometimes impulsively hit myself. My legs are often covered in bruises. If my fiance is around, he'll always hold me, if I start to lash out at myself. He asks me why I don't hit something soft, like my pillow. It's an impulsive act, and the closest thing to me is always myself. I also derive some satisfaction in feeling the contact, even though it's mostly the urge to punch. I have no tolerance for physical pain, but I'm extremely weak, so it barely hurts. I probably wouldn't even have so many bruises, if I didn't bruise so easily.",self-injury

I cut myself for so long for so many years and now all this sudden I got these urges all over again and I don't get it.

Back again,"Last time I was on here I was talking about how I was three years clean and that I didn't want to relapse, but I did end up relapsing and have regressed as far as being able to deal with my stress in a way that's not considered self-harm because that's what my mind jumps to first once more. I'm afraid to tell my therapist (even though I haven't talked to her in five weeks because I don't have anywhere private in my house to talk on the phone with her) because I'm so ashamed that I can't consider myself clean anymore. Does anyone have any advice?",self-injury

I messed up,"I had been doing so well with avoiding self-harm. I started writing and asking for help and setting boundaries. It all worked wonderfully until the past week or so. I have cut 3 times in a week, actually three days in a row. And last night it was way too deep. Deeper than I meant to go. I had to get stitches because I couldn't get the bleeding to stop. So whatever relief I was trying to get from cutting was washed away by the guilt and anxiety of having to seek medical help. Yet those feelings somehow make me want to cut again. I don't know what to do. I still have 6 more days until therapy. Does anyone have any less dangerous, or taboo, coping mechanisms that I can try out? I don't want to keep falling down this spiral.",self-injury
How do I close the door on self injury?,"Hello everyone. I am new to the site and new to the group. I cut for the first time in nearly 5 years on the 19th of this month. It didn't help anything, and deep down I knew it wouldn't. I even told my self as I was thinking about doing it that it wouldn't help. But I couldn't stop thinking about it. I was desperately trying to sleep, but the thoughts wouldn't shut the hell up. It didn't help that I felt terrible that day becase I wasted an entire day playing video games an doing nothing else. I was so dissappointed in my self, but at the same time, angry. Angry because I should be able to motivate myself to do all the things I need to do.  And kind of curve ball here, but angry at my mother too. I hate saying that becuase it is so petty, but I'm trying to be honest with myself. And I love my mother, I really do. I know she loves me, and I know she's worried, and thats why she pushes and pushes and pushes, because she thinks thats the only way I'll get anything done. But, I was just so dissappointed in myself for not doing anything productive, and feeling gulty and worthless because she kept asking me if I had completed this task, or talked to that Doctor. Which I havent done, of course. So later that night, as I was trying to sleep I just kept thinking about it over and over and over. And suddnely,  some small part of my brain screamed ""fuck you!"" I felt so vindictive and righteous as I was doing it. It was like I was punishing myself for being such a terrible person, but it was also a scream of frustration carved in to my own flesh. I thought that if i just got it out of the way, I would be able to sleep. I forgot that when you cut yourself it actually hurts, and you have to live with that for a week or two.That daily reminder that I slipped. I was pretty emotionally jacked up for about 2 or 3 days afterwards.I'm ok now, or as ok as I can be, but its like I opened a door I can't close. Self harm creeps into my thoughts quite a few times a day. Which isnt that bad. Its been worse. But the fact that I didn't think I'd do this again, the fact that I could've chosen something else and didnt...that sucks. I know other coping strategies, and other ways to deal, but it was just the most accessiable and easiest one to do at the moment. Even now, as I'm writing this, I'm picturing the shaving razor in the bathroom that I could use. Its like, I'm not even in emotional distress, but I want to do it anyway...I've since talked to a therapist, and am going to see her every Wednesday for as long as I possibly can, but I don't know why it is so hard to close this door. Why am I thinking about this so much? Why do I want to participate in it so badly, and why can't I get it off my mind? It used to be I only did this when I was in emotional disterss, because it helped momentarily. But I'm not in emotiona distress. Sure, I'm sad, and feel kind of lost...I just want to be grounded. I want something to hold on to. I don't even know what I want, but whatever it is I can't put it into words...I just want to stop thinking about this...why can't close the door?",self-injury
I cant,"When I went into the hospital I had everything figured out for when I got out. Then when I finally got out I had so much going on I couldnt even ask for help.

new to the board & struggling,"i'm a college student and i have pretty severe mental illness. i've been clean from self harm for 3 years but this back-at-home stuff, living with my mom, and having mental illness directly related to the fear of being contaminated and being sick leaves me struggling and grasping at anything to feel okay again.
i feel like i'm drowning, and this is how i felt every single time i hurt myself in the past. i'm so afraid to relapse, but i'm almost more afraid of what happens if i don't. what if this feeling never ends? what if this is just how i am forever? what if the urge to hurt myself never goes away? it's amazing i haven't relapsed already - i have 2 different impulse control disorders and i know it's only because i'm in an video chat classroom right now.
i just don't have any coping mechanisms and to top it all off i can't go to therapy at all - i go through my university.

Since then I have been tracking how often I take it via an app that sends me reminders and shows when I did and didn't take it. Over the course of the past couple of months I have noticed an increase in mood, but also that the lows seem lower. Is that normal? It's as if experiencing the happiness I have been striving for for so long has shown me how bad my low points truly are. Does anyone have any advice, or a different perspective on this issue?

Back pain gone wrong,"Hi guys, I need your valuable advice here. I have consistently been pretty healthy, a couple of times, over the most recent 10 years, my 40s, I have twisted or twinged my back a little and had a little pain for a week or two, and it would leave. But before around 3 weeks, I twisted and bent down to get something from the bottom-most rack of the refrigerator and felt a little pain in my lower back, right where the spine meets the pelvis. Nothing really awful that night, but when I woke the following morning, groggy, felt some pain, but figured it would work out, walked towards the washroom and began brushing my teeth, and something like a dairy cattle poke to my lower back made me nearly tumbled down, I advanced back to bed, and laid there keeping completely still, never needing to feel that again. I didn't go to the doc, I simply attempted to work through it with massage therapy, went a week and a half, hardened and moving slowly, and the back pain step by step diminished, and I thought it was going to reduce, and I probably tried to be too active. On Monday it came back, accompanied by fierce, crippling sciatica on the leg where the pain was, I could hardly walk, and I most likely attempted to be excessively dynamic. I tried calling all the orthopedists in my town, could not get an appointment before next Monday. What the hell is going on? I cannot sit or drive, I can stand, but I cannot walk far. What was a little weird was that I had zero lower back pain, just sciatica. Any insights on what would have happened to me?",self-injury
Feeling kinda guilty,"On the 26th of this month it’ll be 4 years since I started harming, since I ruined a life long friendship. I had gotten suspended from school the first time and I told the school it was my friends knife. I ended up telling my mom the same thing and the friend found out. She told me that if I told the truth she’d give me a second chance. I never did out of fear. Fast forward to about a year ago I had stopped harming for a long period of time and all the guilt finally resurfaced and started eating away at me. I told my mom the truth about 2 or so years late. Anyways I reached out to the friend to actually give a formal apology and let her know that hey I said what I had to say and I don’t expect anything from you. As expected she didn’t care which is completely understandable I’d feel the same way if I was her. I thought that doing all of those things would stop the guilt and it did for a little bit but now that Its close to an anniversary it’s getting a little challenging, I can’t do anything about it other than live with what I did but it hurts because I constantly wish I could go back and fix things etc. but at the same time I know that I probably deserve this terrible feeling considering what I did wasn’t right either way it’s hard to deal with. ",self-injury
Ashamed but wanting it again,"Hi everyone,
My boyfriend and I were so tight. We talked of dreams, a home, a family, a future. He asked me to move closer and I did.
Then he was diagnosed with a disease--it's not a death sentence but he does have to live with it for the rest of his life. Right now, he's overwhelmed; the symptoms can be agonizing and when they are, he wants to be alone.
He's in a dark place and so am I. Suddently I don't know him anymore. Suddently, he says, those dreams are done, with anger and resentment.
Now I'm in a town far from home and friends with no one.
So I started cutting. The last time I did was nearly 10 years ago when I was so desperately sad and hopeless.
It feels so good to get that relief. Now I have to shop for long-sleeve shirts to hide the cuts on my wrists and lower arms.
I can't function. I have work up the a** but I'm in a fog and just wanting to cut again. To clear my head and let loose these feelings festering inside of me.
Thanks for reading. I just needed these words out to people who know what it's like.

Lately I have thought more about restricting my food intake or eraser burns rather than cutting. not that those are any better but they’ve been lingering in my mind quite a lot.

In short, I have a wound that opened up Saturday Morning, and it still hasn't properly closed. It kept bleeding most of the day, but in small enough amounts that the loss itself wasn't worrying, it was that it just didn't stop. I was concerned enough to make a doctor's appointment for Monday morning. Even at the end of today it's oozy and hasn't closed the way it should have. Now the reason the mark was there in the first place, and the reason it opened up, were both due to self harm. It was impulsive, it was small at the time, I didn't think I'd be watching it warily two days later. 
So really I have two problems. The smaller of the two is that I have to tell a doctor I don't know that yes, I self harm and I know I shouldn't and I'm working with my therapist on it. 
The second is that this one doesn't qualify as a small thing anymore and could be an early sign of a very harmful diagnosis. It could mean diabetes, it could be the sign of an ulcer, or some anti-clotting problem, or other metabolic failure. The longer it stays open the higher the chance for infection. Google sais if it doesn't stop bleeding after 10 minutes its a problem worthy of a doctor. 
So Worst case scenario, I know I'm catastrophising, my self harm leads to a diagnosis of early onset diabetes, which I live with for the rest of my shortened life. Best case scenario, I still have to tell a doctor I self harmed, but it heals and is not an omen of something worse.
I mean has this ever happened to you? Where it bleeds for hours, opens up at the slightest disturbance and just won't heal? It's a first for me and I'm freaking out. I'm a scientist, and I don't think my biomedical background is helping my nerves right now. 
I could use any support or insight you could offer.",self-injury
New here....,"As I'm scrolling through posts (I didn't open any yet) I feel like I have finally found a place that understands a battle that I have had for over 15 years.  I just want to thank all of you for having the courage to share your story and daily struggles.  That is something I have not had the strength to do until recently.  You are all so beautiful and so brave. 
To make a long story short: about a yer ago I got sick.  I recently had sugery.  During this time I have been battling depression someting fierce, and feeling like I lost my whole life.  The first coping mechanism I ever found for the feelings of hating myself and wishing I didn't exist or was someone else, was self-harm.
I have been clean from self-harm, drugs, and alcohol for nearly two and a half years.  Shortly after I got sick, I have been battling the urge to self-harm almost every day.  I hope that typing this out will help the desire to lose some of its power.  Over the years I have learned many healthy coping mechanisms to replace the self-harm; however, many of those that help me the most require me to be healthier than I am.  I work hard every day to not give up and give in no matter my circumstance.  I don't want to lose this fight.

Shattered,"I feel like my life is just falling apart bit by bit. My boyfriend moved to California last week and before that we got into a 5 day fight because I was friends with a guy.

But my boyfriend is jealous and feels like he was losing him to me. And now everyone in my family and friend group is convinced that we like like eachother when we are both dating someone.

No one knows that I have still been cutting or that I have anything but it just kills me to feel this way. And I hate that my mom makes me feel this way. I feel like I won't be able to make it the rest of high school. And my actual brother doesn't want to talk to me and my father doesn't call me unless I call him.

I spent an hour last night breaking open a razor to get the blades. I put them in an empty chapstick bottle and now I just wait. I wait for the courage to relapse for when the urges get too much. When I’m sure no one is around. 

Do i I fight these urges? When I do I feel good that I could distract myself but this time around I feel numb and I want to feel something and to be in control, despite knowing if I pick this blade up I will most likely have an allergic reaction.

I feel like I can hear the devil say that I used my whole body as a canvas for his art work..... I know what I'm doing is wrong but I cant seem to stop. I have mentors and people in my life that do know Im cutting but... i just want to stop. But I cant find a reason too (And Ik theres a lot and biblical ones at that too...) does anyone undersand? ,self-injury

Its been 10 years and I'm ready to give in,I haven't cut in 10 years. I have a handle on my depression and for the most part my anxiety. But my ptsd gives me the most trouble.

Relapse,"I haven't hurt myself for a year although I've continued having the most distressing urges and thoughts about it. However, over the last few weeks I've given in and harmed frequently. I feel so stupid and hate myself for it but I don't know how to stop again or what to do about it? It's like I'm harming just so I can get through the day.",self-injury
Cuts,I started cutting when I was in HS stopped for awhile. I guess I just replaced it with punching things. I would punch until my knuckles swelled up. I think I chipped the bone in one of my knuckles. Only recently did I pick up a knife to cut myself again. It got bad. Lots of cuts . I used it as a punishment for anytime I annoyed people or felt like I was bothering them. Cutting for me is a mixed thing I use it as a punishment and to feel something .Lately cutting is the only thing that makes me feel something. I stopped for maybe a week. People at work noticed and now I'm talking to someone about it. I have a lot to work through I thought I was doing better but for some reason I feel really down . Will I ever be better or will I always crash. ,self-injury
Wanting to Relapse,"I quit cutting for over a year, Im 25, I feel like I should be able to put this behind me, but I still get temptations and I just started living on my own in a new city, I been strugling to get myself financialy stable. I graduated in May from an associates in IT but its hard to get started in anything and, I owe over 2000 on my credit card and my job as a housekeeper might not have much work in a couple months because its somewhat seasonal, I havent had a relationship or sex in over 2 and a half years and I have bad social anxiety and my mom has lymphoma and its stage 4 and idk if she will survive. I really just want to go back to cutting, because it comforts me. I fight not too often just because Im afraid of being judged by other people and myself. I tell myself I dont want to be that person anymore, that Im more mature than that but nothing really has changed so much. I deal with things a little better but it doesn't feel like Ill ever be happy, so I don't always see the point in fighting things. I thought if I quit this long, cutting wouldn't even be a thought too much anymore, but I feel like Ill always be addicted.",self-injury
Progress,"2 days until I’m one year clean. I never thought I’d make it to this goal so many times I wanted to slip up but I did it, I made it. 
Its hard to notice but I can kinda tell that I’ve became a bit happier, a bit more motivated, looking forward to everyday since I stopped self harming. 
I suppose I got to such a low point that’s its very exhilarating to be able to come back up to the surface and to genuinely care about my well being. 
Its progress, I’m proud of that and happy to share it with you all in hopes that it will inspire you. You can get through what you’re going through and once you do it’ll be worth it, even just the beginning of recovery is overall worth it!

Urges have come back.,"I have to say that since I found out that I was pregnant in December of 2015 I have done an extremely good job with no harming myself. I didn't want my son to be taken Away from me, or people think that I am an unfit mother, so despite how bad my urges have been I have resisted, for my son. However, I will admit since September it has been hard. I got arrested on 9/11, my grandfather passed away on 9/30. On 10/19 my grandmother passed away. On Oct 8th was my grandfather's fueral, on November 5th was my grandmother's funeral. I have missed a lot of work because I have been extremely sick lately, and my son has been sick. Life has just been extremely tough lately. My mind has been going to that dark place lately. I hate that is where its going. I feel weak for having my mind going to that dark place, but I can't seem to help it. What if I am not strong enough to resist the urges. I hate this so much. ",self-injury

I have began cutting again, after years of not. Only this time on my leg to not draw any attention to it. I'm so lost on what to.",self-injury
just a vent i guess,"I don’t like how everytime i do one little thing wrong i get so negative towards myself. for example: today i had trouble getting my calculator open and just thought “wow what the fuck is wrong with you? you’re so stupid” etc. it sounds stupid when i type it or say it out loud but it’s so frequent especially at school. 

like i tell myself i’m gonna be nicer and not be so hard on myself but i go through with it nor does it rarely work. It’s not even really urges to cut anymore it’s just getting really mad at myself and as i already said putting myself down. 

I started writing in my journal again and that kinda helps. talking here helps too but I wish i could figure how to correct the negative thoughts and switch it to something good instead. also everytime I think about recovery I want to go back to how i was before i started cutting, knowing that’s not how it works. i need to move on from the past and realize i’m gonna grow as a person etc and can’t live there forever. I have to focus on the now and the near future but it’s so stressful and difficult sometimes.

it's been maybe 10 years,"But there's this one relationship. It used to be this intimate friendship. And she was so incredibly there for me when I was a cutter in my teens and early 20s. And God was I in love with her. But she's straight, and we grew up in the church together so I was deeply closeted (still am), and I moved away, and although we remained friends, the friendship we had was no longer intimate. Most of my friendships in that time period, my senior year of high school and early college, were intimate. I haven't had that in over 15 years and there's always a piece of my soul that is dying because of it. But still, I haven't cut in 10 years. It's barely occured to me in that time. Hell, that time was a fluke because before that it had been maybe 5 years. Then last night things were bad with this friend. I tried to ask her how she was, but somehow I was awkward about it, it came out wrong. Then I made it worse by texting more and more throughout the rest of the day. She finally answered and I continued to make it worse. I brought up how intimate out friendship used to be, and how one sided it was and how I recognize I was the one who always ran to her, and never allowed her to lean on me. And I brought up how two, maybe three years ago, I drunkenly admitted my school girl crush on her when I had over estimated her level of intoxication and had assumed my confession would be lost in the ether of the night's festivities. It hadn't been. Everything I do now feels like it's going to be interpretted through this lens of ""is this her being in love with me?"" And God help me, I've been in love with her for 20 years. I'm still deeply in love with her so this  last night, whatever it was, killed me. For the first time in 10 years I needed to cut. But I'm a social worker. A new one. Looking for a job in the summer. The only place I like to cut is my forearm so I can't very well start doing that again. I don't have insurance now so I can't see a therapist either. I'm stuck, and I feel like I'm dying. When I confessed to her my past feelings, it had been after she had confessed to me that she had been cutting herself and oh my God, I was sitting with her, holding her hand and running my fingers over her forearm telling her how precious those arms were to me. There was this moment, I swear it was there, where I could have kissed her and she would have let me. But she would have never spoken to me again. Even if she would have been okay in that moment, she would have panicked the next day and I would have been out of her life forever. It took everything in me to not kiss her, to just hold her hand, and caress her forearm. I would give anything to have that moment back and not be in this one where she thinks whatever it is she thinks about me and where I'm thinking of cutting again. It was this brief reliving of the intimacy we had in our youth. I think it played into the volitility of my moods at the time, and maybe it still has that effect on me, no one else seems to have that effect on me. Not even my last boyfriend. When he broke up me he destroyed me. I made the intentional decision to not kill myself because I couldn't be someone who killed themselves over a fucking man, even though him leaving me made me want to die every single second of every single day for about two years. I don't know how to end this. I'm just hoping that saying this, getting it out that this is how bad I am right now, will help keep me from cutting. ",self-injury
my sadness is overwhelming me,"i wake up with a broken heart everyday. i cant stop screaming, scary memories in my head. the only thing that helps.. at least for a while, is sh. i hate myself and i feel so stupid because i cant stop sh, i cant control memories, i cant control my anxiety.. im so tired.",self-injury
"So sad, so trapped, so sorry","I've read a few entries from other folks and I feel such sorry for them.  What a crazy, chaotic world we live in.  The pressure and unrealistic expectations are immense.
I haven't cut for YEARS tho I often wanted to.  Then I had some horrible family visits (some were great tho!) and then was verbally abused by my own brother.  
2 dozen knife cuts later and it's not enough.  I wanted, NEEDED to stab myself.  But I stopped and thought ""FUCK him! I refuse to give in to this horrible person!"".  So I put the knife down and went out to edge my garden.  Yeah, I still punished my body (and soul) but at least now I have a nicely edged garden!  :)
I think having a backup plan before things get that bad is a must for me.  And others.  
Be safe.  Care for yourself like you would care for someone you love.  Peace, Nibs",self-injury
Self Harm and I,"Hi, um.. I really dont know how to start this but I guess I can just try and give it a go. I self harm, the first time I did it i was really young and didn't know how to deal with what was going on in my life.

I'm what is considered non-binary and I might be transgender.... but I'm still figuring things out, and these questions have led to me harming myself.

***TRIGGER*** Too Much Stress,"Hi, I’m new here and don’t really know how this all works so I’m just kinda winging it and getting all this off my chest.
Over the past two years my self-harming has been spiraling out of control. I’m not suicidal anymore so I’m not trying to kill myself, just harm myself.
I’m so bloody stressed from everything, especially at home. I’m still in my high school years so naturally I live with family. I’m always so tense at home because I’m usually either ignored, yelled at with insults and complaints, or ordered to do chores. Home life is unpredictable as things can be so different from day to day and my family so often tends to just snap and change from happy and laughing to arguing and insults. This causes tons of stress that I usually self-harm to relieve. I’ve done almost everything to harm myself. I’ve cut, pinched and scratched my skin, overate, under ate/starved, overexercised, overdosed on prescription medication, punched myself and walls, stabbed and scratched myself with pencils, poked and scratched myself with needles, pulled my hair, suffocated myself to the point of unconsciousness, banged my head against walls, and that’s all I can think of right now.
I do all this for a bit of relief from the stress and completely overwhelming feelings. Also, because I’m so often told how everything is my fault and I’m such a horrible human being so I deserve to punish myself. And so I know that at least some pain that I’m feeling is real.
This was all just kind of a rant mess. I don’t know what to do and as stated earlier, I just want to type this out and put it out there for somebody to potentially know some of what I’m going through.",self-injury

Hitting myself Not coping well job loss and family,"in April I lost my job. 49 years old and lost everything except what I could fit into my car. Just finished the cross country trip from Florida to Missouri in order to be closer to my dad and some family members. While I seem to be bouncing back already from the job loss and subsequent loss of 99% of my worldly possessions, I am stressed beyond belief. Last week I had an episode prior to leaving Florida of hitting myself in the head and violently pulling my hair. My 26 year old daughter witnessed this and it happened again last night when I got off the phone with a sister. I’m not sure what I can do to stop hitting myself. Last weeks episode was triggered when I screwed up and made a cheap motel reservation for the wrong date. While the reservation was easily fixed by calling customer service, prior to doing so I inflicted many fist punches to my head, pulled my hair and left bruising which had still not healed prior to last nights episode. So last night I punched myself in the head as well as my chest. Now I have bruises over bruises and bruises on my chest. I was gone from Missouri for 15 years. In that time my parents, a sister and a niece came to visit. Of those people, I paid for my parents and niece to come see me. The sister that called last night never came to see me even though she promised she would. My phone didn’t ring over the last decade from her but all of the sudden now that I’m back she starts calling me. I have no desire to see her or speak to her but she wants to come visit me tonight at my 84 year old dads house. While on the phone she compared my “trials and tribulations “ to one of her friends and told me that things could be worse. I guess that was supposed to make me feel better somehow? Anyway, it didn’t and when I hung up the phone I just started hitting myself and cussing. I do not want to see her. I don’t want her to come visit. Why all of the sudden does she feel it’s acceptable for her to start calling me. Did the phone not work while I was across the country? I have not slept last night and now I’m searching to see if I can find a cheap motel to stay at where people will leave me alone. Just because I came back doesn’t mean that they are allowed to just walk into my life after years of ignoring me. This same sister sent me a text message 3 years ago when I tried to move home to Missouri to be closer to my mom before she passed away. In that text message she indicated that I had some kind of a lesbian relationship with another sister of ours. And when I was 12 her then husband raped me in the name of religion. she went on to have another baby with that pedofile/rapist. So our relationship has been quite strained. Not even sure why I answered the phone. I don’t know how to cope with all this so I have taken to hitting myself I assume since I don’t know how to be assertive and tell her to efff off. Just typing this makes me want to hit myself. Does anyone have any advice on how I can possibly cope and prevent further self harm? I am really afraid that this will escalate into a much more serious situation and that I will at some point harm myself in much less reversible manner. It feels like I am dying inside. And I want to speed up the process and finish the job. ",self-injury
SI when your an adult,"Hello everyone, 
My name is Bella and I have been battling SI since I was 12 years old. I am now 27 so its been over a decade that this has been in my life. I have been to therapists and admitted myself into a hospital when I was 18. Since then I havent cut on a regular basis but this past year I have really been struggling with my PTSD (rape survivor) and that mixed with everything else going on in my life is a cocktail for relapse. Its been about 4 days since my last relapse and honestly Im so ashamed of myself. Ive work really hard on the many things that used to hold me prisoner and let so many things go. Now its time for me to heal the parts of myself that being raped has damaged and its so hard to face that pain. The nightmares, day dreams, flahsbacks and anything else that triggers those memories and feelings are ruining me.

The dreaded relapse...,"I went over two years without cutting. When things became too much, there were a few times that I'd pinch or scratch at myself, but never anything that left a mark. 
It all came to a head last night. I used a pair of scissors to tear away at my arm.
I'm so disappointed in myself. I'd done so well, I'd kicked my bad habit, and then this... and of course, just in time for the warm weather. I had forgotten how awkward it was to be wearing long sleeves despite the fact that it's 80 degrees outside. Especially at work; God, I'd lose my job if anyone saw. 
The relapse was a wakeup call. I'd been falling apart for quite awhile, now, and I've just been allowing it to happen. Now, while my stomach might roll with nausea every time I glance down at my arm, I at least know that I've officially fallen back into my pit and I'm ready to do whatever is necessary to get out of it.

Grateful!,"I have not cut for 3 years. There have been many stressors in my life lately and I started pulling my hair until it hurt. I think I have a lot of anger and I just wanted to cut. All I could do is cry my eyes out. I yelled at God. I know he loves me and he wants me to be real with him. So, I was real in my emotion last night. I asked him to sustain me with the willingness to do the right thing. I just did not want to take care of myself. I felt so wiped out after that moment with him I fell a sleep. Releasing that emotion defused my desire to cut some. Hopefully, I can continue to walk in His grace. Since I suffer with depression, I was surprised that my spirit was lifted a bit today and finally got some things done around my house. I thank God that he is faithful and he really does hear our prayers!",self-injury

One of those days I got really upset and  I was just like forget it. I  went to my safe spot aka my bathroom.  Then I did my  first real cut across my arm. After the day I continued and anytime I did it  I told myself  I hated me because of what I’ve done. Of course I’m not proud of not being able to stop but I’m proud of them and so should everyone else because those are your battle scars those are what brought you to victory. I wish to stop. But we all don’t get what we want...,self-injury
A while,"it has been a while since I started hurting myself. I made promises to the people that I love and I still want to do it, but I haven’t done it yet. My scars are healing. Why is it I still have the needs to harm myself, but I can’t bring myself to do it anymore? ",self-injury

New to group and frustrated,"Not sure if this will help.  I have self-harmed in one form or another as long I can remember.  I have c-PTSD and have been working thru the things that trigger my urge to cut.  Lasted 6 months without doing it, faltered a few weeks back.  Finally opened up to my therapist about it yesterday.  He asked me to open up about what triggered me, what I did, and how I feel about it now.  I glossed over the specifics but he stopped me and asked specific questions about where on my body.  I guess my frustration is that I feel the same way every time.  It makes me embarrassed and angry at myself.  Am I alone?",self-injury

contemplating relapse.,"I've really been wanting to relapse lately. whenever i used to cut almost everyday whenever i would walk after school i'd go to the store and get blades. the other day I walked to my friends house, I had money and all i could think about was going in and buying some pencil sharpeners I didnt do it but i'd like to try to. i'm sure i would regret it but relapse just seems nice right now.",self-injury
My problems,"Hey!!
I would like to share my experience as a migraine sufferer. Around two years ago I began getting awful headaches when I was around 20 years old. Now I'm working in an MNC and I find it very difficult with a severe migraine while sitting almost 24 hrs in front of the laptops. Sometimes I would be unable to complete my work due to a heavy migraine. For anyone who suffers from a migraine reading this, will totally understand the frustration of being told that it’s only a headache and that you’re drinking too much coffee etc.  Living with a migraine has changed so much for me. For being 18 years old I rarely touch alcohol as I can’t justify inflicting a headache upon myself when I spend three or four days out of the week crying in pain with headaches. I tried certain painkillers. Burt there is of no use. I heard about medical cannabis treatment at a clinic in Ontario ( http://apollocannabis.ca/ ). How to intake medical marijuana? What are the side effects? Kindly share your experiences.

Do you hide your scars?,"I used to hide my scars all the time, i was super self-conscious of my arms and always wore long sleeves or wrapped something around my forearm to cover them.
Recently I've stopped doing that, but i find i still want to keep my arms covered on first dates or when meeting new people. Sometimes I will hide fresh scars from close friends for a couple days until either they've healed up a bit or i feel ok to be asked about them if they get noticed.

idk...,"I have self-harmed since I was a teenager. I went for a while without doing it, but in the last year, I have cut myself as least once a month (and yes, at times other than PMS).

He was angry because I needed to complete my timesheet and mileage last night and I did not spend it with him. I have been so depressed lately. I usually take pride in my ability to care and work, but lately I have been neglected so much.

Can't stand seeing it disappear,"After 2 years of not cutting I relapsed back into it.  Things have become a mess in my personal life, and cutting is a way for me to feel like I can deal with all of the emotions and anger and lack of control without exploding on someone else.  Even though I know that it isn't a good outlet, it feels familiar and ""safe"".  I don't want the cutting to be a crutch for me so I told my housemate and handed over all of my razor blades.  But now, every day when I see that the places where I cut are healing and closing over, I feel paniced and want to rip them back open.  It's like seeing them heal feels like my control is disappearing.  I knew that it would be hard to give up the act of cutting, but I didn't realize how hard it would be to see the cuts begin to disappear.  Of course I use a razor blade so that it won't scar long-term, but I like the temporary reminder that it's still there.  I feel like I'm going crazy because of it.",self-injury

Trying not to fall back into it,"I have been doing these things to myself for 2 decades - cutting, burning, biting, scratching, pulling hair, picking scabs, ect. I try not to be so hard on myself, but I keep asking myself when does it stop? Do the urges ever go away. I stopped cutting for 6 years. Why do I keep doing these things? Why can't I JUST DO SOMETHING else that doesnt involve hurting myself? Exactly why did I start doing this in the first place?",self-injury
I think this is important,"So when I cut I use razor blades so they don't leave scars. But when I go to bed I pick at them and my mouth would water. I freaked myself out and I thought it was a symptom of being a serial killer or something.
So I googled ""psychology behind cutting"" first, and it said that self harm is a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar, OCD, and others. 
Then I googled ""why does my mouth water when I pick my scabs"" and it came up with a type of OCD that uses incessant scab picking to calm nerves and patients go into a trance like state when picking. 
My point is that maybe there's something ELSE that we need to get a grip on that could in turn fix the self harm. For me, OCD doesn't really have treatment, but simply knowing makes me feel better. ",self-injury
5 Years and 8 Months Clean........But Relapse,"So long story short, I have been clean of self-harm for five years until eight months ago and since then I also have been clean. But recently with my depression hitting me so fast I feel like resisting the urge to self-harm again is just not enough for me to feel better, I have a serious drive to try to feel better. I have been in constant battle with depression for my whole life and it is an on-going struggle to battle my need to self-harm myself, I just turned twenty three twelve days ago and I thought I was over my self-harm and was close to battling my depression until recently when my mother who I used to be close to started to show she no longer seemed to care about me to a point she seemed to happy when I said (mostly out of frustration during an argument) that I should move away then and she acted like it would bring her joy when she said; ""Good!"" So it struck me and all my efforts to battle my depression and self-harm suddenly crashed down, she was there when I relapsed from self-harm eight months before and tried to assure me everything will be okay (I am severely financially unstable) and the stress of it has brought depression out of me. Since then I am struggling not to steal my old razor blades that I threw away and go back to self-harm again, I want to feel better and I want to feel alive again, not be stuck in this hopelessness that says I should be dead than alive. Self-harm only made me feel worst than it could make me feel better and one of the reasons I want to stop is for my sister who also knew I self-harmed and had been clean, I hadn't went through with it but I feel the urge to go back to it.",self-injury

Q: Can Eating Be Self Harm?,"Caution warning for suicide, mentions of cutting.

Probably a rediculous question but IDK. Can over eating be considered self harm? My depression gets so bad I waver back and forth on life and death and feel I'm barely hanging on the line. I feel like, I over eat so much, and drink so so so much soda (Consider one to two 2 litres a day to myself) is in fact my ""new"" way of self harming.
I went from cutting, to taking too many pills, ect, to... this. It feels rediculous. But when my husband asks me what the heck I'm doing, why I eat like garbage, and drink so much soda, my only answer is ""I just want to die, and this is as close as I can get.""

It isn't even that I eat a lot honestly. I eat maybe twice a day, but when I do, it's junk, and it's a LOT. Then I wash it all down with a soda. Then I feel crummy. I'm way over weight, I have a ton of limiting disabilities and so I'm in constant pain and it's like this is all I can control.
Self harm for me was control. Cutting myself meant I controlled how deep I'd go, how much blood I wanted, how much pain I was bottling up would be released. Sometimes, I was out of control and couldn't stop it, in the throws of depression. It was a high.

I'm literally in the mindset that food will kill me.

If I'm lucky.",self-injury
I’m fine,i know all of you probably have your own problems to worry about but I just needed to say this... I have tried to kill myself a few times now and I cut everyday I recently started burning myself because I couldn’t get ahold of anything sharp. On top of that my dad that left me when I was 10 I recently got in touch with and found out he replaced me and my family for some other women and Her kids. I’m extremely suicidal nowadays and I don’t know how much longer I can do this I only feel pain I can’t remember the last time I was happy or felt normal. It’s not because of that it’s just everything is too much to deal with.,self-injury

The fine line.,"Yes I realize the irony in the title. For the last 12 years I have been self harm free. Over those years, the need but or simply the desire to cut has been difficult to thru. The last month has been exceptionally difficult. My arms tingle, my mind races. It seems the only way to get the release I'm looking for. I've done all the things to cope. I've talked about it. I've asked for help but nothing is giving me what I think I need. My thought patterns are stuck. 
The fine line lies between happiness and being ok and knowing I can feel better, the other side is not quite happy but okay enough to survive.

a year clean but not happy about it,"february 9th was the last time i cut. i think i knew it was the last time as soon as i did it, because cutting was always something that made me immediately more relaxed and at peace with myself. but this last time, i had been going to therapy for months already, and i started to feel more and more guilt and disappointment in myself every time i cut. so i guess it just stopped being as helpful to get rid of negative feelings as it once was, because it just added more negative feelings.
i think it's important to say that, because it wasn't really that i wanted to stop cutting, but more that i felt like i had to. i think that's how most people probably end up quitting as well, but it just sucks.
a few months ago i came so close to relapsing. i was desperate, and constantly debating whether i should give into the daily urges now, before i hit a year clean, or wait until after being a year clean. neither option seemed good to me, because i hated the idea of starting over. and that's pretty much the only reason i still haven't done it now.
for some reason i told my friends that i was about to be a year clean pretty soon, and they want to do something to celebrate it. so i've been Googling things and looking up different ways that people have celebrated being a year clean from SH. in fact, i was just doing that a few minutes ago, but i felt myself start to get really anxious. i became aware of my heartbeat speeding up and started to panic a bit. just the idea of throwing a huge party or doing a big thing for this is nerve wracking, and i don't know why. i know i should be so happy for accomplishing this and feel proud, but somehow i can't feel proud because the whole time i've been ""healing"" and ""overcoming this"" i've still just been wanting to cut. nothing has changed except for the fact that i just don't do it anymore. i still want to cut almost everyday. i feel like i shouldn't even deserve to celebrate this.
and don't get me wrong, i know that i have made some progress. i mean, even though i want to cut all the time, i still have found some way to finally say no to those urges. i still found a way to stop, and i guess that's really what we're celebrating. i do know that i'm also more mentally stable now and i try to solve my problems rationally instead of resorting to something that will make me forget them temporarily.
honestly, i think what the biggest issue is here is that i'm so afraid of cutting it again, and this is only amplifying that fear. my friend asked me what i wanted to do to celebrate, and i joked saying, ""the only thing i want to do to celebrate not cutting anymore, is cut again."" but i'm beginning to realize that's not just a joke, and that's honestly the only ""reward"" i can see really making me happy for making it this far. it's also scary, because i know that after a year passes, i will never be able to self harm again unless it's something seriously huge. after a whole year of being clean, i can't see myself just throwing that away. if i do, i will hate myself for it, and my SH will probably become even worse than it was before. but the idea of never doing it again is also terrifying, because i feel like i will have these urges forever.
i've learned how to stop giving in to the urges, but i haven't learned how to stop them.",self-injury

not really sure,"my therapist gets upset when i try to diagnose myself with more problems but thats a whole nother issue. I want to say I dont have an eating disorder but I dont really know much about it. I dont eat very much mostly beacuse Im not hungry. My body doesnt tell me i want to eat so I just dont. I could go a whole day without eating and be okay with it. Actually eating makes my stomach hurt and makes me feel bloated. I still do eat enough to pass through a day i guess but its nothing healthy because I dont find a point in making myself healthy at all. I have depression and anxiety so a part me just thinks this is all linked to the depression of wanting to not make myself feel good. I usually like the pain my stomach feels when its hungry, the bubbling and aches is kind of an easy way to make myself feel pain. I dont really know why I do it because its not intentional but i dont not like doing it. I like thinking some day i might faint from hunger but idk im sorry to mself for doing it but i cant stop im really just dont want food. sorry for the vent just really confused about my diet. ",eating-disorders
Food guilt,"Hi everyone. I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder but if I don't stop bad habits, I could be. not started last week. I am a bridesmaid in my sister's wedding in two weeks. I ordered my dress in March, it came in in May and it fit well. Well I tried it on last week with the new shoes I bought and now the dress won't zip. I know I am overweight and it's because of a medication I take for my bipolar illness. So I've barely been eating so I can lose weight to fit this dress. I weigh myself every night and so far have lost three lbs. on Monday I made myself sick from not eating and left work early. Today I ate avocado on toast with a fried egg. Mom took me and dad to dinner at a steakhouse. I ate less than half of my meal. Everything I eat I feel guilty about.

^My name is caroline I am 14 years old and I am recovering from a long time struggle with an eating disorder(manily anorexia). I have gotten mostly better and am no longer at the dire low weight I was at before. Although, I did most of the recovering myself and was never put in a proper treatment program. I think my parents were half aware that |I had an eating disorder but not that I am at a much better weight for me I don;t think they understand I still have issues. I still weight myself a lot and am focaused on maintaing a certain weight for my height. I am going to a new school next year and am nervous about how people will percieve me.

I binge/purge cyclically
It looks like I may be going back to work soon and that means I'll be in camp away from my friends and family for two week stretches. Feeling lonely is of course a big trigger for me, and it stimulates my craving for sugar. That sensation of having a knot in my guts freaks me out. I know where it leads.
Generally I start obsessing about sex. Then that wears off and I start to feel lonely and isolated. Now i'm f....d. I begin to believe the self talk that says i'm pathetic and will never be loved by, or be able, to love a women. The talk says that intimacy and even true friendship, is beyond my capabilities. 
Now the cravings begin. I'm back with my head in the toilet. Thats not satisfying enough and I'm now feeling hopless and wishing that I had never been born. I may as well go all in and crack out. At least I'll get to feel pleasure again before I die( this is what i tell myself).
I don't feel afraid to die, but the thought of going back to sticking my finger down my throut, does not appeal to me, to say the least.
Just venting some concerns and putting myself out there to the universe!

Stress and thoughts during this lockdown,"During this COVID-19  it has been really hard cause i've been feeling more anxious than usual I got on meds for my anxiety a few months ago I'm on 2 medications for that. When i came back from africa towards the end of february ever sense i was younger I did this thing where I would skip lunch and breakfast then only eating dinner and small snacks throughout the dya sometimes. I didn't see this as an issue but one of my best friends did as I always had stomach issues, one time in august of last year I was sick with a cold and my blood results were off and my doctor said i needed to drink   and eat more cause I was malnurished and still this wasn't a huge issue to me, my eating habits have always been pretty bad like that never completely stopped eating but would do the whole snacking through the day and just eating dinner avoiding breakfast and lunch sometimes. Eventually when I came back from Africa my best friend explained to me what I was doing to my body when that habit was going and then said to me that it was a problem that I didnt' see my eating habits as a problem and I went home that night thinking about it and was grateful that he said this to me because I did realize now that it was a problem and started fixing it, I never realized why i did it and then I started therapy going over a lot of past stuff and I've always had body image issues and confidence issues and found myself over the last few months looking in the mirror, worrying about my weight, feeling guilty of what I was eating even though I'm a heatlhy weight for my age I always wanted to lose more and I'm now seeing a therapist and fixing these eating habits I now make sure I eat Breakfast, lunch and dinner and other days are harder than  others so on the harder days i push myself I have anxiety and OCD so often times when things are tensed or when people are angry I start thinking about all those thoughts again. Does anybody have any coping mechanisms they use to help them through when they are feeling this way?  This is as best as I could explain my situation, I've slowly told more people how i""m struggling and that talking about diets can be triggering for my thoughts. Does anybody know what helps them when they have random days that started feeling like this? ",eating-disorders
Stressing About NES,"I feel very stressed about my EDs right now... I know it's probably rampant right now, since so many of us are stuck at home and have to face our EDs full on. I, very fortunately, am still working as a pharmacy technician; that gets me out of the house, but it's not helpful when I get home, which is when I binge eat like there's no tomorrow. It's really upsetting because I've tried so many different things to stop doing it. I've tried not buying any food; that turned out to be a very expensive endeavor as I was getting takeout a lot. I've tried removing all the foods I binge on at night; didn't help because I just bought them and ate them during the day. I've tried taping my cabinets and fridge shut and covering them with notes telling me not to eat; I didn't read them and just ripped through the tape. Sometimes I remember eating at night, and other times I wake up and head to breakfast and see a ton of crumbs and wrappers on the kitchen counter with no recollection of having eaten the night before. My therapist and I are trying to figure out what is triggering me to do it; it seems to be part psychological and part automatic habit at this point, as I've been doing it for over 6 years at this point. I feel horrifically ashamed of my nighttime eating, especially as I learned in early March that I'm over 200 pounds. Again. Back where I was in 2013. This blows. I exercise four times a week (hopefully that is not triggering to anyone) and I also power walk a lot, but my eating is a real problem. I'm so good during the day, but when I get home from work around midnight it all goes to hell. I had a revelation last week and told my therapist that part of the reason I eat at night is because, as I said to her, ""I want to be bad."" Since then, I've also recorded some of my other triggers, which include being upset about current events and also being in severe pain from a workout I did the other day. I just don't know what my pyschological revelation means or why I feel that way. I wish I could swim-- it's pretty much the only cardio workout I've ever enjoyed, and of course, right now all the pools and rec centers are closed. I do a ton of strength training workouts, and like I said, I power walk. Power walking around my neighborhood is so boring though. I will not run. Fuck that. I will not be humiliated in public. Swimming has always been both energizing and soothing for me, very cathartic. Just me and the water and glorious silence. I just feel so depressed over my NES-- it's a major problem and I don't know what else to do to get rid of it. I feel like I'm a horrible person and I just wish I could get rid of it. The worst part is that, deep down, I feel like I could overcome it, but that something is blocking me and holding me back. I just don't know what or why.",eating-disorders
Stagnancy making this hard,"I am having trouble with the gyms not being open right now.  I had anorexia back in my early 20s and have struggled off and on with it.
When things around me are out of my control I get those anorexic tendancies again.  I've been consumed with the 10lbs Ive managed to gain in a year and being isolated and stagnant has not helped.  I am consumed with thoughts during the day about skipping meals.
Yesterday I did some research on the Keto diet thru Slimfast.  I think this would help me organize my eating times and food-atleast I'd have a pattern to go by and it gives me the control I need.  My boyfriend does not understand my need to skip dinner in the evenings.  It's hard to explain to him.  I want things to go back to normal.",eating-disorders
Relapsing Hard,"I am really in a bad place right now. I am diagnosed since I was a teen...I'm early 40s now. I'd been healthy and ""recovered"" for years (like 15+) and then last year, I had a short relapse. Binge/purge. I went back to my psych, got some treatment and within 6 months, I was back on the road to recovery.
Fast forward to now. My partner (of 10 years) and I moved to a new city. I work from home and have been having trouble making friends. She was not. She made friends and has a job that is very social. Anyway, I found out she was cheating on me with a couple. I had suspected but she gaslighted me hard. I thought I was going crazy. She didn't even confess until well after the fact that she built a relationship with these other people. She told them she loved them. Point is...I am spiraling. I cannot find my self-worth and I am unable to not think about food all the time and calories and exercise (things I can control). I'm exercising up to 3 hours a day, restricting foods, and obsessing about my appearance. I haven't binged/purged (my go to), but I fight myself everyday not to. I have no support system here (new city), no family, no friends, no medical team like back home, and even if I could find a community run group to drop in, I'm stuck with a stay at home order. I am really struggling. Help. Me. Please. ",eating-disorders
Just another day,"I feel like my eating disorder is just part of who I am now. Like logically I know it's not normal, I know it doesn't define me, but I cannot picture myself without it. After nearly 15 years of it I don't even know who I would be without it.
I'm not thin like I used to be. I have about 15lbs of pregnancy weight left, so it's been harder to be accepting of myself. I struggled with anorexia between 10-15 years old and then turned to bulimia. I'm 25 now. I'm just so frustrated because I find myself purging without thinking twice, even when I haven't binged. Before I could try Ito talk myself out of it. I just feel like it's a 'normal' part of my day now, like having a cup of coffee or going to work. Not something to think twice about or question and I'm trying to work out what's changed in me.

being understood,"last night I had a few glasses of wine with my roommate. I tried to explain to her that I have an eating disorder and it is the binging and purging that precedes my use of smoking crack. I tried to explain to her that I'm not actually into doing drugs, but they take away the urge to purge. She did not get it. I remember standing up at an OA meeting and expressing that I would rather be sticking a needle in my arm that sticking my finger down my throut.
Both addictions are horrible, but I carry more shame when it comes to having an eating disorder. Perhaps the reason is that I am a man. i don't know.

I developed an eating disorder from one bully who I thought was my friend. He would constantly call me any names he could think of whether they made sense or not. My parents found out about a year later because my band teacher saw me ripping up food and then going to purge at lunch. It's been several years of this.

New to this group,"Honestly, I'm questioning why I am here. I think I have disordered eating but have never met full criteria for any of the eating disorders, including the OSFEDs so I question if I even have disordered eating sometimes. I meet all criteria for anorexia, except being medically underweight. I restrict what I eat and track it in an app, I workout to burn off what I do eat, I am terrified of gaining weight, and am constantly comparing my weight to others (even if we aren't the same height). For me, I feel like I am not good enough unless I am the skinniest one in the room. I love the feeling of getting out of bed and my vision going black and me having to hold on to the side of my bed because I am light-headed; I know I shouldn't, but I do. But see, I struggle with this because as soon as I go a day without eating and I am proud of myself (which is the opposite of how I should feel and I know that but I don’t), I end up eating a lot of food. I wouldn't say they are binge eating episodes as I don't typically eat more than a normal person would in one sitting, but to me, they feel like binges and I have to start all over in my restricting. I guess I am just confused. Am I suffering from an eating disorder or am I not? Typically no, I'm not, I don’t meet any of the criteria for any of the eating disorders, but then what is it that I have because I feel like its way bigger of a problem than just disordered eating. I came here to maybe get a better understanding of what it is I am dealing with and to not feel so alone in my quest for ""recovery"" (if I even really have something to recover from because I honestly don’t know). ",eating-disorders

Thank god I have gotten past the food problems but I am still very concerned about my feelings and scared that I will always have this in the back of my head. I am seeing a eating disorder therapist once a week. The hard part is that I live alone and going through a divorce. I have grown children who live out of state.

New Here & Struggling,"Hello all....
i am new to this group,and although it is always really hard for me to reach out i am trying to here.
i am going to be 45 this year.My eating has been disordered since i was 11 years old.
i developed full blown anorexia in 2008.
i have been to an inpatient program 3 times,the most recent admission last March.Every time i went into treatment i ran.
i regret that now.
In March i left after 5 whole days.i just packed my bags,didn't give staff a chance to talk me out of it.
This program is CBT based and goal based,both things i find extremely difficult.i became overwhelmed.i tried to reach out to staff about it,but it did no good.i was suicidal before i went inpatient,and being that depressed there was awful.
i actually had not too much trouble with the meals and snacks.i finished everything,as scary as it was.i always felt like i had finished first,eaten too quickly,every meal felt like a binge.i felt like such a glutton.
Anyway.
Once i was back home i was determined to recover on my own,even though i know all too well from experience that it is hard,if not impossible to recover in isolation.
i actually did much better for awhile,although i was not eating perfectly,i wouldn't be hungry for dinner for example,so i wouldn't have any.i was binging.
i was putting on weight,and although it felt odd to notice my changing body,i was not all that freaked out by it.i couldn't bring myself to get rid of my scale but i was only weighing myself once a week.
Any improvement i made was soon all undone.i cannot pinpoint any trigger that set me backwards again,but it didn't take long for it to happen.
Now i am drowning in it again.Heavily restricting,binging sometimes,sleep eating,weighing myself multiple times a day,body checking.
It is getting worse day by day.
i am too old for this.i have wasted years to this.
i have an amazing therapist,and he is really trying to challenge me.He has told me that my older body can take much less abuse than when i was younger.
My healthy side wants recovery desperatley.My eating disorder wants to thrive.
i'm considering going back into the hospital if i can't turn this around as an outpatient.
i dunno.
i am so ashamed to be middle aged and living with this.
Please,to those of you who are younger than i am,i hope you all will get help,and embrace recovery.You don't want to end up being my age and still struggling.

Hello All,"Hello there, my name is Pechadur, and today is the day where I'm finally admitting that I haven't gotten over my ED, it's just morphed into something else. When I was eleven I was diagonsed with a GED- not quite leaning into anorexia nor into bulemia, I was just not eating enough to give me energy throughout the day.However, when I was eighteen I started to eat more and I thought I broke the vicious cycle of starving myself until I needed to eat something small. Boy was I wrong (I think). As the doctors in my area are only interested in pushing pills instead of actual therapy or help, I can't say for certain, but I think I'm now exhibiting signs of Binge Eating Disorder.At first I thought it was just a ""diet"" where I would purposefully starve myself until dinner, where I would then eat a lot of food. I also will go out and buy cookies and crisps after a stressful day and eat the entire package, which then comes with feelings of guilt and hatred towards myself for doing that. I know it's unhealthy but even if I did try to seek professional help in my area, I know it wouldn't do much good.It's just the feeling of a loss of self control that I hate and wish I could fix, though it's hard by myself. I don't want to admit it to my family because all I'll hear is ""I told you so"" in reference to my previous disorder.So... that's my struggle with food and eating.

I'm in Stage 3a failure. I guess that's not so bad. (It's kinda bad) If I take care of myself now, I could stay at this stage and probably avoid dialysis...or so says the nephrologist. I follow up in 4 weeks to see if it's advancing. My labwork looks like I'm starving, even though I'm NOT underweight. Which is how they diagnosed me. I'm malnourished. Dehydrated. You think all this would be enough to make me ""just eat"". Only now it's not so easy. Even though I want to. I can't. My therapist found a team of ED Specialized Dietitians for us to start working with. They had me start using this app called Recovery Record. I've been using it for 2 weeks with them. It's really amazing. Hard, but amazing for recovery and accountability and encouragement and keeping me in touch with my team all day, 7 days a week. I'm scared. I don't know how to live without my eating disorder. But it's killing me...physically and emotionally. I HAVE to start eating. I HAVE to start somewhere.

Shallow Friendship,"I have been suffering from anorexia for the past year. Prior to that I have spent the majority of my life being obese. Both issues are different sides of the same coin - trying to have something that is all my own that no one else can control and trying to cope in a family where emotions qualified you for ""being too much."" While I was heavy I had a friendship for 5 years with another woman who was also heavy. Among many other things we had in common we would discuss our challenges with being overweight. Once I lost significant weight and developed anorexia she no longer chose to be my friend. She said that I was a ""trigger"" to her and stopped wanting to be around me. To top it all off, my friend is a therapist who works with clients that are binge eaters. You would think that she woud empathy for my struggle and some loyalty to our friendship. I have vacillated between being sad, hurt and angry. I feel abandoned in a time of needed support. Yes, I am only thinking about me and not how I am affecting her. Yes, that is selfish of me. It's just that it is one more example in a lifetime of examples of being shunned when what I needed was to be seen. ",eating-disorders

Confused and Conflicted,"I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa around 13 years ago. I have thought for the longest time that I was recovered, that it was no longer an issue. But recently, I have begun to question that notion and have realized I've held on to AN in more ways than I previously thought.
I guess I am feeling confused at the moment of whether or not I have a problem. I realize that denial/lack of insight into the seriousness of the problem is a part of the disorder. I do technically fit the criteria and especially over the past several months, have felt tortured by my disordered thoughts and my weight has gone down some. And yet I always try to convince myself I do not have AN (I eat too much, love food too much, am just meant to be very thin, still get my period so my low BMI must mean I am ok, etc). 
I don't know. I feel in such a hard place right now. People around me are very concerned about my safety and yet I feel as if I am not seeing everything they are seeing. It is hurting my relationships. And sometimes I can see I am hurting myself, and even in those times, find it hard to care because I am filled with so much self-hate. There is such a large part of me that wants to destroy myself.
I feel ashamed I still struggle, and at a loss because if I am not even entirely able to see the problem, how will I ever recover? And then of course there is a part of me that clings to the eating disorder and does not want to let go of it. And yet I feel as if I have reached a point where I can no longer live with it. 
I am not sure what point I am trying to get across...I guess I just wanted a space to write all of this out, so thank you to anyone who reads this.",eating-disorders

I have little to no friends, and tend to live in secret most of the time. I try to go out but my anxiety limits me on most things. I find that it is easy for me to socialize when i exercise. I really want to live a normal recovered lifestyle but it seems distance. I love to exercise, but never feel I can ever take a break. I feel guilty every morning and try to make up for it. I tend to workout 3-6 hours a day depending. I am so afraid to confide in anyone about this because i feel awful about what i do, being so wasteful and uncontrolled. I dont feel anyone understands. I am afraid i will be like this forever. It feeds into my depression and makes me feel i am unfit for life. I dont know where to start, not sure if their is hope for me. I just want to enjoy life again and learn to love myself. anyone else feel this way? any suggestions?

i want to be better.. i really do. i want a life, i want freedom but i also want to look pretty, and the only way to look pretty is being skinny.

i tried so many things to try and help myself. i wrote in journals, went to therapy, made food logs, eating healthy and working out. but nothing is working. nothing is helping.

Need advice/opinnions,"So, I’ve been out of inpatient for about 2 months.. When I initially got out I was at a “healthy” weight and suppose to go into a program. When I got out I decided to not do the program because I thought I could manage it and deal with it with the help of my therapist.
Now, I’ve lost all the weight I’ve gained in the hospital and my therapist wants me to do a higher level of treatment because what I’m doing now is not working. I keep trying to tell her I just need more time and I can show her that I can do it with the help of her and my family. But, apart me knows I probably need to go and get more help because nothing on a lower level seems to be helping. The idea of putting my family through that is emotionally exhausting for me and them.

After the 3 days I spent in the hospital, I've already gained about 6 pounds from protein shakes and large portions etc. I'm extremely stressed about this because I don't want to gain anymore weight especially when the doctor promised me I wouldn't gain just maintain the weight I was at now. Now I feel super jittery and unhealthy and I can't lose the weight or else they'll send me back to the hospital for being ""negligent.""

I don't want to go back to the old me and it sucks that this was forced on me. Any thoughts?

I don't think to not journal,"is an option at this point.  I think by focusing on it too much I give ""it"" energy, I believe in some way this is more of an ego disorder also.  I know putting weight back on is making me not want to go in public, do anything or see anyone I know.  Maybe that is some of the purpose I do this.  To isolate myself.  But that is not an option.  I have a daughter with special needs, High Functioning Asperger's Syndrome.  She is very high functioning acedemically, however socially and sensory has been very challenging for both of us.  We have been in therapy since Birth to Three, 15 years.  She is amazing, without early intervention she would not be where she is.  I have had my own therapy and team of health doctors.  I have trauma and chronic pain and illness I deal with each day.  I might be repeating my, I hope not.  This definately is'nt a poor me either.  I am so grateful for my daughter, therapists, doctors, friends and family.  I also know through suffering we gain a higher consciousness, if we choose to.  However, this binge eating is kicking my ass, I have had other addictions that since having my daughter I have been able to let go of.  But suffering every day overeating till I'm sick is having an impact on my health.  I do exercise everyday, walking and PT exercises, which is definately helping.  But I don't want to just be helping myself, I want to lose this weight and eat like a normal person.  I thought the first night I journaled and didn't over eat so much that this was the ""answer"", then yesterday was crazy with food after I did everything I had to and my daughter went for a nap.  She never sees me binge, and she seems to eat very healthy, eats when she is hungry and stops when she's not.  My mother was a compusive overeater and it had a big effect on me.
It does feel good to be honest about all this.  Maybe not feel good but it's like decompressing from the day/night before.  I guess this is another tool to help me, not the answer to all my food issues.
It's about the journey not the destination.  There are many mountains that get in my way but they also are how God strengthens my Spirit.

I don't know how to change this,"I have many issues.  But for here and for now my binge eating is taking over my life.  I suppose that is what it is meant to do.  If that is what I am focusing on then I don't need to focus on my life.  My life isn't anyone elses idea of a dream, but for me I think or thought I am managing well.  Except for my nightly binging.  I eat and excersice well every day.  Then the night creeps in and I am a zombie and foods are living humans.  I eat till I get sick and it puts me asleep.  Now like I first wrote, I have many issues.  I have been clean and sober for 14 years, quit smoking 13 years ago, have Bipolar Disorder diagnosed since I was eight,  have battled Hep C from a transfusion when I was a baby.  Did a 7 month and then 11 month RX with the old drugs like Interferon. Was made to leave home when I was 14.  And it goes on and on, however these have been the opportunities to strengthen my faith in my God, and to start my climb to my higher consciousness.  I have to amazing therapists, one being a yoga and spiritual teacher really.  All this to say I know my first addiction and way of escaping pain was with food.  So here I am, full circle.  I talk about it in therapy, ""journal"" about it, meditate about it and so on.  Still I have been stuck in this daily, or nightly, binging cycle for almost a year now.  I have always struggled with food, weight up and down, and binging.  But this is different and I don't know how to change or what to do.  I have tried all the suggestions from people who don't really get it, have a snack ready, don't eat after six, blah, blah, blah.  But I thank my God for another opportunity to face this Goliath.  I do believe every situation happens for a reason, and even though this is not changing in my way or my time, there is a purpose to bring me to where I am Spiritually supposed to be.  It still sucks!

Never Been “Sick Enough”,"I know that “sick enough” is a myth that ED has created in order to keep me stuck in my eating disorder...but it’s so hard not to believe that it’s true. I feel like I’ve never been “sick enough.” I’ve been at my lowest weight 2 separate times, but each time, it was never a problem for me to gain again on my own. However, once I did gain, I hated myself all over again. I feel like once I’m finally “sick enough” and recover from that, then I can fully live. Isn’t that so irrational? But that’s what my eating disorder is telling me. It wants me to try one more time. To lose weight and have a doctor tell me to go to residential or PHP. To have someone give me permission to eat. To have to be fed through a tube. To lose my period. To see my bones. And I believe it! That’s the frustrating part. I’ll believe that part of my brain and say “here we go again” and I’ll starve for a few weeks. And then in comes my rational brain very “inconveniently” and I’m like...wait - I’m hungry and I’m human and I need food! And I binge. And then I hate myself all over again. I feel like either I need to do the stupid thing and fully commit to being “sick enough” or fully commit to recovery. I’m also worried about this...once I’m “sick enough” people will think I’m healthy. Like last time I was sick. They praised me, said “what’s your secret?” to losing weight, my parents were finally proud of me. And then I’ll just be stuck again. So I think about all of this and then my depression kicks in and I’m like “why don’t I just throw in the towel?” 
Has anyone ever had similar thoughts before or currently? I know what I need to do - I need to recover. But it’s just SO HARD. ED is so unbelievably convincing. Literally like the snake in the Garden of Eden lol. ",eating-disorders
Struggling with ED,"TW: 


Eating disorders, sexual assault, depression, anxiety, ptsd, suicidal ideation, self harm


I have suffered with Bulimia for going on 2 years now, but yo-yo'd weight loss and gain with it in 2017. Last year, I became exceptionally obsessive over my weight and image, having suffered with it all my life. I reached an ultimate high in my weight, resulting in my enhanced attachment to my ED. I was able to lose 60lbs from bingeing/purging/restricting, laxative abuse, 1 gal. of water daily, and over exercising from March to October and then, I hit a plateau.
In December of 2018, I was assaulted and since, I have struggled with severe depression, anxiety and ptsd. I began on a binge spree in January of this year. After the assault, I struggled with my life and ended up becoming suicidal. I quit my job at the end of February and holed myself up, costing myself a 20lb weight gain in 3 months. I am now struggling with the tendency to do as I did before, but lack extreme motivation, therefore I binge. I am constantly beating myself up for doing this to myself and think about harming myself to make it stop, as I have never been happy with myself. I allowed this to cost me my engagement. 
I need help, support, motivation, anything to recover. I am stuck in this cycle and losing miserably due to the onslaught of mentally debilitating disorders I suffer from. I want to lose weight and I am so obsessed with it I do not THINK about anything else except for my wrist size, my collar bones, my neck/face fat, my thighs getting more cellulite, my belly gaining a couple of inches. Please. I need something. I have been going to therapy for 2 months since I came out about the assault, but no one understands. ",eating-disorders

Struggling big time,"After almost 4 years without any bulimia behaviors, I have relapsed. I find myself lonelier than ever. I have zero friends besides my husband and acquaintances at work. It is difficult to stay motivated in recovery when I feel that I get so stuck in recovery that I isolate. It’s as if the recovery becomes my new way of coping. I am still not living. If anything, I live less, because I am scared that anything can be a trigger. 
The positive side is that I know that I can survive day to day without bulimia. But will I ever be able to live without it? I know that what I am missing is connection to something greater than myself. 
I want to reach out here so that I can be honest about what is going on. I feel a lot of shame about the fact that I have “messed up” my recovery, which has prevented me from reaching out to anyone in person.hopefully this helps me move past this.

I recently had weight loss surgery, almost 6mo ago. I'm getting teased or bullied by friends and family saying that I took the easy way out. This is not easy by any means! I get mixed messages by my doctors and other ed professionals. On one hand I'm getting praised for losing weight and on the other hand I'm getting messages that I'm fine just the way that I am, (HAES). I am following all the ""rules"" that my bariatric surgeon says is vital and I really don't want to let him down. I went to see another pain specialist for my first consultation who told me that if I just lose the weight I wouldn't be in pain. He had no history of my chronic pain issues. He gave me this really restrictive diet to follow. I felt very dismissed and felt like he was very rude about it all. Idk what to do? I see my bariatric surgeon in two weeks for my 6mo follow up appt. Maybe I should have never had the surgery? I thought it would help. I was pre-diabetic, had a fatty liver, high cholesterol and had high blood pressure, not to mention the severe pain I was in. Most of these have resolved themselves now. According to the BMI, that my surgeon lives by, I'm still obese. I want to be healthy but I don't know what to do anymore? I love food, probably too much. I've never restricted prior to surgery. But I have binged and purged. I restrict now because of the after bariatric surgery diet that I'm on. I don't want this to blow up into a huge ed crisis. I've got other mental health issues on my plate as it is. I have a trauma specalist therapist who has also suggested losing weight to feel better about myself. I'm frustrated, confused, and stuck. I don't know who to reach out to? I'm a member of gastric sleeve support groups on fb as well as ed support groups on fb. On one the gastric sleeve page I'm seeing pre and post op pictures of people who have lost a bunch of weight and I compare myself to them. And on the ed pages I'm seeing intuitive eating and HAES posts and how being thin won't make me any happier. I'm just confused and don't know what to do?

New here and struggling,"I’ve been battling Ed for 10 years. Biggest problem I have is I also deal with abandonment issues and depression on top of it. I think I started when my grandma died and my marriage was crumbling. This was all shortly after I lost 40 pounds and was the fittest I had ever been. So it had set the stage so to speak. Meaning I was very regimented in eating and exercising at that time and those events seemed to be triggers and I felt it was a way of controlling something. I am not going to lie it felt good the first time I threw up. Of course that sounds rediculous now. Well I over the years I found ways to combat it but it would always return. I always thought I was smarter and now it’s back and worse than ever. But for the first time I am talking about it and I am going tomorrow to seek help for it. There’s a few things I want to share that may help some people. I do know these things for sure. By doing this I did cause my thyroid disorders which is terrible because your thyroid controls immune systems mood metabolism body temperature etc. also once do this for awhile the hardest thing to overcome is your brain 
i mean not just the voice of telling you to do it but the chemicals that happen when you do it . Ultimately your brain all day seeks out rewards . I mean for example like for me it’s m&ms if I see those my brain says reward. So I have to tell my self are you really getting a reward by eating those? Of course not because it sets off a chain of horrible events. Also I say this ultimately because I have been in the position many times, once you get your body into any habit , it will fight change it wants to maintain homeostasis. Even if it’s not healthy. That’s why when people try to do something they have to stick with it long enough to get change. Most people don’t make it that long. Like me, it takes a month to break a habit. Basically you replace a bad habit with a good one. I have tell my self this often but it is true that starving yourself or throwing up like me causes your body to hang on to all body weight and actually it will consume vital organs and muscles first. And once you start doing that it will stay in that mode for a long time to protect its self. That’s a fact. I say all this because like you I struggle and I’m trying really hard cause I think if I can go a whole month then I can keep going. And sometimes the littlest ways people say things can be so profound. Thank you for reading. This is the first time I have been able to tell anyone. I know now I can’t do this alone. Wish me luck with the dr.",eating-disorders
Is Not Eating ok,"hi im new to this group. I’ve had some emotional upheaval lately and I have no appetite, not even hungry, I current weigh or should I say last Wednesday I was 205 lb but after a few issues and not really eating much, still drinking water, we’ll ok only really drinking water for the last 5 days I’m down to 191 lb I realise that this isn’t normally healthy but I’ve not been hungry at all I think I’ve had maybe two stomach rumbles the whole time, today I made myself eat a couple of eggs. I can be in the kitchen cooking things and can be around people eating but I just don’t feel like eating. I’m not missing the taste of food or the process of eating it. It’s not like I’m drinking gallons of water to fill my stomach just been sipping throughout the day. 
So basically I’m just asking people opinions on way my bodies decide it doesn’t require food. It’s not like my body doesn’t have excess fat it could lose",eating-disorders
Grieving Old Self,"I feel like I grieve my old self everyday. I miss who I was before I had depression. I long for my smaller body when I was deep in my eating disorder. I’ve gotten to the point where I realize that what I did to get that smaller body was unhealthy and I know it would be harmful to do it again. I’m also learning to accept that the size that I’m at now is my body’s natural set point. But I still miss my smaller self. It was so much more comfortable. I still haven’t gotten used to my “new” self. I had gotten so used to being cold all the time that it’s uncomfortable for me to have a normal body temperature, let alone feel sweaty and warm. I miss how the smaller sizes were big on me. It’s so uncomfortable how my stomach and back roll and my thighs touch. Every time I get my period my eating disorder HATES it. It was so much easier to be peppy and energetic when I had less weight to carry around. My fingers and toes look stumpy now, and my cheeks touch my glasses. I can’t feel my bones anymore. The sad part is, this all is part of being a healthy human. Everything that makes me uncomfortable is something I should technically be grateful for - warmth in my body, fertility, the fact that I have legs to move, “womanly curves” lol. I guess some days I grieve my old self more than others, and this is one of those days. I’m wondering if anyone else can relate, and what is helpful for you when feeling these emotions? ",eating-disorders
Stubborn,"Basically, I feel like such a stubborn little shit who’s always playing the victim. A few years ago I was dealing with an eating disorder, really underweight and unhealthy. It was like a different kind of depression. I went to a therapist (but not for my eating disorder bc my mom refused to accept that I had one), got meds for anxiety and depression yadda yadda yadda. I started gaining weight because now that I wasn’t so anxious anymore I was fucking hungry lol. I would eat a lot of food at one time because of extreme hunger (which is normal if you’ve been starving for 3 years). What bothers me is that THAT is the moment my parents and doctors decided I have an eating disorder. My mom told my therapist I couldn’t stop binge eating, which made me feel ashamed, therefore I tried to starve myself time and time again only to be severely hungry and EAT. I’m at a stable weight, the weight I was before I purposefully starved myself thin, but I hate myself more than ever. I left school because I can’t focus on anything, I’ve had to quit little part time jobs because more often than not I have days where I can’t make myself get out of bed, though I hardly ever sleep. I lost all my friends because no one can rely on me, my family and my doctors treat me as if I’m stupid and lazy and addicted to eating. One of the doctors told me she could help me lose weight...which is the reason I’m here in the first place!! The psychiatrist prescribed me a medicine that is used to suppress my appetite and I just...do people even know how wrong that is?! And now I just want to be like...if they don’t believe what the problem here actually is, if they’ll only believe me if I’m fucking emaciated, I can do that - no problem! I did it before. I know I shouldn’t but it seems like that’s what everyone wants. Everyone, even the treatment teams, are biased. If they don’t think I need help unless I’m in the hospital with a feeding tube, then maybe that’s what I have to do. ",eating-disorders
Never Important,"Sometimes I feel like my eating disorder will be important enough to my family after my nephew passed away. I try to please them and not complain and don’t or I get fed up and blow up and then she still gets mad st me. When is she going to start seeing I’m not okay and have a little sympathy for me and talk to me instead of yelling and dismissing my feelings. I’m a human being and I need psychological help or outpatient treatment. I can’t stop and if i keep living like this I’ll have a mental breakdown or worse, besides dealing with my depression and anxiety. Any tips or suggestions since im already seeing a counselor and she says I need to say no to doing stuff for my parents; it’s just hard to say no. ",eating-disorders

Relapse,I’ve relapsed back into my eating disorder. I’m not sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. Frankly I don’t know where to turn to for support. My therapist had said she’d stop seeing me if I regressed. I’m thinking I should just keep it a secret and see where it leads me.,eating-disorders
Recovery is HARD...but it’s worth it,"Recovery is SO damn hard, but I’m sure you all already know this. I started my recovery process 2 years ago this month, and let me tell you, I thought my life would be “perfect” by now. Recently, I have been so angry with myself, picking out all of my flaws, everything I’ve done wrong. But in this moment, I’m able to look back and see just how far I’ve come. 
2 years ago, I thought recovery meant “just eating” and being fine, but it is SOOO much more than that. For me, the eating part came first, and everything was fine until my body started changing. Then, I would freak out, try to restrict again, and end up binging because of extreme hunger. Then, I’d get even more angry with myself and the cycle would start again. 
And I’m not going to lie to you, that still happens to me today. However, now my body is at its natural set point. Now comes the hard work - accepting my body for what it is and what it can do, while not trying to change it. This is more difficult than “just eating.” My mind struggles every day, every hour, with thoughts like “maybe I should try this diet tomorrow...no wait, that’s wrong...maybe I should buy a scale..no no no!” 
It’s important to not act on these thoughts, but just let them be, which I’ve been doing pretty well, but I get soooo frustrated having my mind constantly at war 24/7...like sometimes it’s even in my dreams! I pray that someday these thoughts will become less and less until I can’t even hear them anymore.
The other thing that’s difficult about recovery - once you can’t use manipulating food and body as a coping mechanism, you have to get to the bottom of what’s really going on. For me, that’s depression and anxiety. That means that once my coping mechanism got taken away, I became a MESS. I still am a mess, but I’m a self-aware mess.
I started having to take medications, using a “sun-lamp,” a weighted blanket, trying ANYTHING besides something harmful. So that’s also part of the reason it’s been hard for me to see my progress throughout these two years. 
On the outside, I look like a failure. I withdrew from school, lost all of my friends, I can’t handle school or a part-time job right now, I live with my parents, I have no idea what I want to do with my life or how I’ll get there...and the list goes on and on.
But if I decided not to give a shit about what other people think of me (which is what I’ve been working on), I would be confident in knowing this: I’m only 19 years old, I have a family that loves and supports me, my mind is simply not ready for big commitments right now because it’s not in a good place and I can recognize that, I’m willingly going to therapy and taking my medications, I lost those “friends” because they really weren’t friends at all. 
At the end of the day, here’s what motivates me to recover...1) I like food. My disordered self HATES myself for admitting it, but I DO. It’s yummy, it gives me energy, it makes me happy, and oh yeah...I need it to survive! 2) I don’t want to be a shallow person. My disordered self was soooo shallow. My mind was constantly hating on myself and others based on looks. Not to mention I was hangry all the time. 3) I want happiness for myself. I really do, even though for some reason it’s hard to admit. And I deserve happiness. As do YOU! I want a family and a career I love someday and I can’t do that I don’t have mental space because my eating disorder is using it all. 
Anyways, this post is a mess, bless you if you’ve made it this far, but I wrote on here for both of us. For me, it was to actually recognize, in writing, how much I’ve grown. For you, it’s to show you that recovery is not a straight line, and that’s okay. At least we’re trying. This is just one example of what recovery looks like. Obviously I have serious work to do still, which is totally fine. You may be in the early stages, or in the depths of it like me, or you may be on top of a mountain right now. But wherever you are, just take a second to recognize how far you’ve come. 
I believe in you and in myself. We both deserve a rich, full life filled with happiness. Best wishes and love to you all! ",eating-disorders

Eating Disorder?,"This has been an issue I have been dealing with for upwards of 7 months now. I've been in and out of doctors seeking assistance in order to go back to the days where i was ""healthy"". My lowest weight was 110.2 lbs which started at 140.4 lbs and dropped in a matter of two months. I'm still declining in weight as my safe foods aren't feeling so safe anymore. I was prescribed a new medicine by the name of ""Reglan"" in order to stimulate my stomach but it only made matters worse and caused multiple panic attacks. I'm currently taking 20mg of Prozac once a day in order to control my anxiety but everytime i eat now i feel like i dont have control over myself and am hit with a rush of nausea which doesnt seem to go away. I attempted using games as an escape and it works as I played while eating and it was feeling like progress but that progress seems to have been lost. Im stuck in a rut and im really seeking for the answer which will at the very least bring me back to the progress i made a few months ago.

Starting a conversation,"Hello Everyone,
I am an older person, who when I was in high school began my struggle with an eating disorder. I was anorexic mostly and bulimic. I would not eat all day except for dinner. My parents were very strict and not sitting at the table for dinner was not an option. So, I would eat dinner and in turn purge it afterwards. I exercised for at least four hours a day, a two hour walk after school and then two hours of intense exercising before bed. Along with that I use to cut myself. I also abused laxatives when I could get my hands on them.
My parents overlooked these things. I do believe they knew and possibly did not know how to deal with these issues,  eating disorders were still not very understood when I was younger.
Now that I am older I do not indulge in these behaviors as frequently. But, yes over the years still I have gone through bouts of laxative abuse. And occasionally through out a years time of I unconsciously over ate would then purge my food back up.
This past Christmas was actually the last physical time for now. This past weekend on my lunch break at work I took three bites of my food, realized that if I kept eating I would find myself over the toilet. So instead I threw my food in the garbage. I do not know if that was the right choice, however, that what I did.
I didn’t realize this would still be a thing twenty or so years later. I didn’t realize that it never really went away just because I did it less and less over the years.
I am a little terrified of these urges and how strongly they seem to be coming back. Yes, I do have a therapy appointment coming soon and have recently been put on meds.
Thank you for your time and attention. Best wishes to the rest of you all. ",eating-disorders

Body dysmorphia and binge eating disorder,"As a child, I was fed a lot and stuffed because my mom and grandma and even great grandma showed their kids love with what they could give us and food made them feel good and we learned to let it make us feel good. As a kid, teen and young adult, I suffered multuple different mental health disorders, was overweight, drank a lot because that was all I knew and developed a really bad attitude and a saturation of hate and negativity in my life. I got pregnant as a teen and it wasnt until she was a few years old that I realized, I need and want to change my life for the better. I started small by noticing when and why I had an attitude, I slowly began eating healthier foods with my clients and soon I was dropping pounds and physically feeling good. Worthy. Powerful. I lacked a lot of knowledge about myself and how the PTSD and anxiety/depression impacted me from the inside out. Though I had become a happier and healthier person on the outside, I was still rotting with fear of failure, abandonment, hurt and addiction on the inside. I gained all the weight I lost back and then some about two years ago and honestly It was one of the best lessons I have learned. I started going to eating disorder therapy, learning about my binge eating disorder and how body dysmorphia was literally driving me insane. I was obsessed with how I looked to others, myself and had to pinch, squeeze and suck in parts of my body all day long. The anxiety didnt let me sleep and eating became part of my life again as it had been for 90% it. A bad part. The controlling part that made me want to eat and feel bad. The part that made me hide from mirrors and feel disgusting and ugly. I have learned that small baby steps in the right direction of physical, emotional and spiritual growth are sooo powerful and impactful to the quality of our lives. I finally feel like I have the tools. Not to succeed or be perfect, but to ask for help, be open minded to support and the help I ask for and take things slow and steady with myself, others and the universes timing and expectations. I want to work on myself daily and help others in the process if possible. I think the broken pieces I was able to put back together are more artistic and unique anyways. Being broken and getting back up creates a beauty within us that we dont know of until it happens. Starting now, I am on a journey of self love and self acceptance. I have my days, weeks and moments of ups and downs and flawed qualities but this time around I can utilize the tools I have accumulated and learn new ones without feeling like a failure. Hopefully. ",eating-disorders

I need some advice. I feel as though I am to my limit of having to deal with stuff over and over again. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder and no matter what I try to be strong and keep my feelings inside, but my counselor says I need to say how I feel; because I currently live with my parents and they took in my brothers 4 children so they wouldn't have to go to foster care. And I have been helping to take care of them since I was 10 and now I'm 27, but I have kept my feelings in and not said a word especially since my sister's baby is going to be passing away. So, I've been worried about telling my mom because I feel like she will think I'm being selfish or being a bitch.

And I also should think of someone outside of myself and think about what my sister and brother-in-law are going through. So, she asked me what would I like her to do and all I want is for her to listen and understand me and not judge me and know that my mental and physical health is important; because my counselor has told me over and over again I'm not being selfish and I need to put myself first for the sake of my mental and physical health, since more stressed I get my anxiety and eating disorder get worse. But, I understand how I can get her to see and understand that. Any thoughts or suggestions

One or the Other,"I am reaching a point in my life where I have come to realize that I can never be healthy. I'll always either be fat and happy with myself, or anorexic and have the approval of everyone in my life. I say ""fat and happy"" because, strange as it sounds, I've come to realize that I AM more comfortable with myself when I'm overweight. Even though I realize that a morbid excess of weight is unhealthy and I'm not encouraging people to be overweight, every single time I've been overweight in my life, I've at least known who the hell I am. When I've lost weight, it's been to such an extent each time that I've become too weak and sick to function correctly. The last time this happened, I was living on fewer than 400 calories a day and exercising with a broken ankle. I could barely stand on my own. Wounds wouldn't heal. I couldn't think straight. But I was thin, and that is all anyone else cared about. Everyone treated me like I was suddenly ""better"" than I had been before, which was bullshit. Nobody becomes a better person from losing weight. Or gaining it. Or whatever. Because my BMI was in the normal range, doctors didn't care. They said I was fine and treated me like wannabe BFFs, even though they'd barely given me the time of day when I was 250 lbs. Everyone kept encouraging me, calling me an inspiration. Yeah, an inspiration... I was ready to keel over.
These days, I'm not 250 lbs, but I'm certainly not thin either. I would like to take up exercise again for the sake of good health, but I'm terrified I'll revert back to being addicted to it. I refuse to live like that ever again. Not for your approval. Not for a doctor's. Not for anyone's. In all my life, I've either been extremely skinny or very overweight. There's never been an in between. And I don't know how to create one. I'd like to be at whatever weight is healthy for me personally while maintaining the identity and sense of self that I have when I'm fat, but I don't know how to do that.

Question,"Do you ever get to a point where you think you can finally do this? It’s been a few days and things have been going fine and you’re doing everything right. And then one thing goes wrong and you think no it’s fine I’m going to deal with this the right way. And you go to the people who said they would be there if you needed them, the people who said you were enough, the people who said you were worth it, the people who said they cared. The people who lied. They don’t want to help and slowly everything falls apart again. 
I thought I could do it. I thought I had people to help but asking for help seems to be giving someone the biggest burden that they don’t want or need. And here we are again stuck and alone with no idea where to go.",eating-disorders

Ambivalence,"I have really been struggling with this ambivalence thing ever since I started treatment a couple months ago. I can picture a happy life - one where I’m free of my eating disorder, I help others, food/my body doesn’t take up all of my mental space, I have deep and meaningful relationships, etc. But also, I can picture a life where I barely get by and basically “go through the motions.” One where I hold onto my eating disorder. I’d have a job, relationships, etc. but nothing would seem fulfilling. However, for some reason, this life seems just as inticing as the first one and I don’t know why. I feel bad for admitting it. Part of the reason, a VERY petty and awful reason, is to spite my treatment team. They really don’t understand what I truly struggle with. Sure, right now I’m struggling with binging, but it’s not because I’m “eating my feelings,” it’s because I’m mentally hungry after years of starving. And they don’t get it no matter how much I tell them. Probably because I’m heavier now. When I tell them how long I’ve gone without binging, they praise me, and that makes my starving mind from years ago feel AWFUL because it’s like they’re saying not eating is a good thing. Also, the doctor told me “we can even help you lose weight!...not that you neeeed to...” so I guess there’s a part of me that’s like “you want to see what I looked like when I was physically sick as well? Because I can do it again!” Which is terrible to think. I don’t know. Everyone treated me better when I was skinny even if I wasn’t happy. It was almost easier.",eating-disorders

Hi there. A little about me...,"Hello, DS world. 

I have been here before - a long time and many years and seasons of my life ago. But so much has changed since then. I am not the same woman I was then. 

To be honest, I am only just beginning to find the woman I am now. 

To that end, I write. And I felt two things: 
one, to join a support group for people struggling with anorexia and/or its cohabitating roommates, anxiety and depression. People struggling to rebuild and re-find themselves after trauma. People coming to terms with this whole being and becoming process. People like me who are just...learning to become. Again. Their own people. For the first time. Ever. An identity. 

the second thing I felt, was moved to write. Freely. Poetically. Becommingly. 

So, I did. And I began my journey on a page. And I let it bleed there and I'll let it live there. But I'd like to let you get to know it. Get to know my raw soul, bleeding on a page? Finding its passion and its breath and its identity for the first time - ever? And yet, also, again. Somehow. 

Anyway, come know me? I want to know you too. And we will talk and dialogue with each other in the coming days and weeks ahead. 

I love you all, already. We all love each other here. We're all in this together. Here you are, beautiful soul. And here, I am. Here we are - together. Becoming. 

Please read? And please...come. 

https://piecesofsoul.home.blog/2018/12/21/the-journey-begins/

I really and truly look forward to getting to know all of you as the days go on and dialoging honestly about the messiness and how to navigate this thing together. <3 Hugs to all of you beautiful people. ",eating-disorders

Confused Ex-Anorexic,"I've got more of a question than anything else to start off my journey in this group. I've spent time in the depression group but I've been starting to have eating problems again and it's all so confusing!
I seem to have this weird issue with food. I can tell that I'm hungry, my stomach aches for food, and as long as I eat something that sounds beyond delicious (like doughnuts), I have no problem eating plenty. There are a few foods that I have no problem eating ever, like cereal and bread, but I seem to have this strange aversion to leftovers, especially. Even if the leftovers were tasty the first time around, every time I try to eat them on their second try, my stomach hurts really bad and I literally can't eat more than a few bites. I'll sit there fantasizing about eating crackers or doughnuts because I am honestly really hungry, yet the leftovers (which actually do taste good) sit on my plate and I feel sick if I try to eat more. Is this just a  case of ""there's always room for dessert"" and I've somehow trained my body to rebel against healthy food? Does this happen to anyone else? Like you feel like you only have an eating disorder with certain foods?
Bit of background: I had anorexia fairly bad at 12 - 16, but it hasn't plagued me much in the last decade (I'm 31), yet I have had many stomach troubles (gastritis or inflammation of the stomach lining), so it's possible this is somehow related to digestion instead of a mental issue, but I'm curious what everyone thinks. It's causing a real problem in my marriage since I have to tell my husband how much I can't eat his food, though I enjoy it, and then he catches me sneaking crackers and cheese later. It's like I can only eat snack foods. It's so strange!
Thanks in advance so much for everyone's help!",eating-disorders

New and stuck,Well this is my first time on anything like this and I’m not really sure if it will help but I decided I’d try. I’ve been dealing with eating disorders/disorderly eating for more years than I care to admit and it recently got to a point to where my family knows. They don’t really seem to understand it and I just feel stuck because I don’t want to get worse but I don’t really want to gain any weight either. I just wanted to see if I could find people that wouldn’t think I’m stupid for everything that goes through my head everyday.,eating-disorders
absolutely miserable and can't stop crying.,"I can't stop crying. I'm so embarrased by how I look, I can't go outside even when my knee isn't in excruciating pain. I truly regret going to rehab. It wasn't an E.D. recovering place. I miss being even 102 lbs which is 22 lbs more than what I was averaging. I've had 3 people now tell me I need to lose weight. I did a whole lot of research on Mirtazapine for sleep. My Dr. told me that it dosen't slow down your metabolism. He lied. It messes w/your hormones and slows down your metabolism.  Probably a lot. He finally prescribed another med to take w/mirtazapine that I use to be on w/o the mirtazapine becuz I wasn't sleeping enuf and would be up as early as 4AM. But at such a very low dose. I was taking 5 times that much 44 lbs ago. Still waking up way too early. And I'm so very depressed. I know for a fact that I do not eat enuf to weight or be the size I am. I'm literally fatter than I've ever been. I've gained more inches than lbs. I've never looked this hidious all over. I was seriously so much happier weighing between 80 and 92 lbs. I was very comfortable in my skin. I was so flat I didn't need a bra. Now I'm so uncomfortable and way more disabled. I practically live in my nighty. But My boobs r so very heavy I just can' get comfortable. I'm crying soooo very much, I don't even know if I'm making any sense. I desperately want to stop taking the mirtazapine and just be on the seroquel which also has a side effect of gaining weight. But I never gained any weight being on it. I'm really hoping to get my psych dr. to do this w/o waiting for an appt. 
I am having such a hard time getting out of myself. I wan't to be able to help in anyway I can, those of u that r also having a hard time. I'm so frustrated w/myself for being sooooo incredibly self-absorbed. Can anyone relate at all? I'm sooooo desperate 4 a kind word or any kind of encouragement.",eating-disorders

I feel like everything is out of control! I don’t know what to do, think or feel. And I have virtually no support system.",eating-disorders
Insecurities,"I had to finally face my fears and stand on a scale after two or so months of not standing on one, in fear of seeing a three digit number. I’m at a two digit, decimal number (in pounds) right now, but it’s so close to a three digit number, I’m horrified! Now my chest is in a lot of pain and am slightly struggling to breathe...it’s also not that easy to type this post without a few typos here and there. Normally, when I stand on a scale and see a three digit number, I either get a panic attack, engage in purging, engage in excessive workouts, or even attempt suicide. The pain doesn’t stop for a whole day, which is why I prefer checking my weight in the evening so I can do a couple sit-ups, jumping jacks, or laps (running) before I sleep. Then, I can sleep the pain away. With my mom monitoring me all the time while I try to eat with that look on her face that kind of forces me to tell her the truth, I’m always scared of mentioning this to her. She gets angry whenever I don’t eat and forces me to eat. I feel like there are better ways to solve my problem than force feeding; force feeding is so painful!",eating-disorders
Unintentional weight loss,"I'm starting to worry because I stopped purging but I'm still losing a lot of weight even though I'm eating more because I feel a hungry lion all the time even after eating.

My friend who is diabetic wanted to check my blood sugar because she was concerned and it was 500 but at the same time I have been drinking a lot of juice lately so it's probably that. She told me to go to the hospital but I will wait to see how I feel the next couple of days. By the way I'm scared of needles that's the problem.",eating-disorders

Angry,"I’m mad because it feels like no one understands. Not “society”, my family, and maybe not even my treatment team. I’ve had this disorder for years, starting as a kid, before I even knew what it was. I’m mad because my parents didn’t recognize it. I’m mad because my parents were partly the reason it started. I’m mad because my parents didn’t realize how bad it was until I was at my breaking point for the millionth time 9 years later. I’m also mad because when I finally receive treatment, I feel like I’ve been diagnosed with the wrong thing. They diagnosed me with binge eating disorder, and I guess right now I have been binge eating. But really, it’s because I restricted my food intake for 2 years prior to this, and my treatment team knows this because I told them. And the same thing happened when I was younger. I personally feel like the bingeing is because my mind still feels starved, like I’m still traumatized from when I was starving, you know? I think about those times and want to cry. I might not be physically starving anymore, but I feel mentally starved. It seems like no one gets that. My dietitian has me on a meal plan, and it’s not restrictive at all for my body, but for my mind, it IS. I have to track what I eat and it takes me back to a dark place. I feel like no one understands this. They just see me as fat. I’m almost positive that’s what my parents see me as. They had more love and concern for me when I was thinner, when I was starving. Since I’ve been binge eating, all I’ve gotten is anger, frustration, and confusion. They’ll say “I don’t know what to do anymore,” “I don’t know how to help you.” And that makes me feel like the biggest screw up of all time. Just writing this out is making me cry because I remember all of the times I was starving and how proud of me my parents were. I had just lost a lot of weight and my mom said, “wow, you’re looking really healthy - I think this is the size you’re meanf to be at!” when I had no period, I was permanently cold, my joints ached. This summer, when I was sitting with my mom crying because I had binged and I don’t look like my old (sick) self anymore, she offered to go on a diet with me. I’m at a loss for what to do. ",eating-disorders

Triggered,"I NEED to stop getting on instagram. It just triggers me left and right. Tonight was the filming of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show, I guess, and it was all over social media. I felt (and still feel) terrible. It seems like EVERYONE follows those models, everyone loves them, everyone pictures them as the ideal people to either be or to love. I mean they’re tall and skinny and beautiful, so why not? The frustrating thing is I know what’s right - I know that only a tiny portion of the female population actually look like that and that fashion shows like that are ultimately a part of diet culture. I know that I shouldn’t spend all of my time worried and focused on looking just like those models, but it’s like the whole world is telling me otherwise. I know this seems so superficial, but I’m 19 and have never had a romantic relationship, mostly because ED has taken away all of my time and energy. But then I look at these pictures of “perfect” models and I think “well now I’ll NEVER have a boyfriend because I look nowhere NEAR anything like that.”  Is that what people really want? ",eating-disorders

Upset about a scale #,"I've been struggling with an ED for almost 10 years now and I am utterly sick of it. I was in pretty good recovery for about 5 years until recently. I stepped on a scale at the gym at work and the numbers each day were crawling up. At home, first thing in the morning, naked I had stepped on the scale before my boyfreind took it away and it was always around 115-116.5 lbs. At work it was even higher 117-120. Then I fell back into my obsession with calorie counting and reducing a little bit of intake. I restarted seeing my RD and her scale also said 117, but she weighed me later in the day. I am probably freaking out because of a minor fluctuation from water/food, and not making a bowel movement. I read an article in Women's magazine about a dietitian who weighed herself 15 times in one day - and the scale said she gained like almost 10 lbs. all day. It's hard to believe for our own bodies that this is true. I just need to regain some stregnth and stop restricting myself again and be so NUMBER FOCUSED!!!! My RD gave me a range between 115-120 lbs. It's just hard to accept.

Why do restaurants post calories??,"I’ve been in recovery for about a year and thanks to my supportive partner and friends I’m getting much more comfortable with not having to plan every meal. I’ve even been okay eating ‘bad’ foods like French fries!!
Hhowever I’ve had a couple breakdowns recently. I’ve noticed more restaurants, especially fast casual places are posting the calories right in the menu next to every freaking item. I’ve had to leave more than one restaurant because of this. I hate that something so small has such an impact on me. But I can’t eat after seeing that one meal or item is whatever amount of calories.
My partner understands why it’s so tough for me to see the caloric measures on a menu. He even ordered for me this weekend so I didn’t have to see how many calories I was eating. This made it easier to eat but I was still stuck on the calories-Ed was trying to add them up while the other voice was telling Ed to stfu.  
It just sucks though. I’m so paranoid about where I might run into this. I’m afraid I’ll be out with coworkers or family and not be able to eat and everything will come back. 
I get that most people need a reminder that they’re eating too many calories. But for people recovering from restrictive eating rules it makes going out to eat even more stressful. I wish they would stop this and people could just figure the calories out on their own. ",eating-disorders

I have next to no appetite. My thighs, stomach and chi chis r grossly enormous. My chi chis feel like boulders. I could use them in place of weights. Seriously No exaggeration. I wear same sizes in most clothing as my care giver and she is about 25 lbs over weight and weighs 43 lbs more than me and is 1 inch shorter than me. The # on the scale doesn't bother me. I just wish it was way more muscle than fat. I'm gaining way more inches than lbs. I suffer from ongoing edema and severe constipation. I eat a very wide variety of foods containing fiber. I've done a whole lot of research on remedies for severe constipation. It doesn't matter how much fiber I consume. If I don't have 2 servings of prune juice and 3 tablespoons of olive oil, I won't poop at all. All that waste that my body is holding onto is turning into fat on my body. If I get a glance at my body naked it makes me cry soooo very much. When I got up to 102 which is very close to the lowest amount I should weigh which is 108, I wasn't so concerned about how my body looked or felt.

I am new here. I am 40 years old and been through a lot in terms of ED's, recovery, relapses, different therapy, etc, and thought it time to give back to the community and offer my expereince by way of support to others going through similar experiences. 
I can provide some insight in to what it felt like for me to go in to recovery, which therapies worked for me, what it feels like to be recovered, and I guess to answer the question (from my point of view) whether it is posisble to be fully receovered from an ED, which I think is something many people question.
I will take the time to write my full story soon, but for now I wanted to just write a short introduction to say hello, and invite anyone to ask questions.

New to the group,"hi, I’m new to the group and am wondering how exactly this works. I had considered myself pretty close to recovered from my restrictive/compulsive behaviors around eating and obsessing over what to eat, anxiety about eating out or being around food I couldn’t track/calculate etc. and I was feeling great but lately it seems to be coming back up and I am struggling to get a handle on it. Any similar experiences? Words of wisdom? ",eating-disorders

How to know when you need serious help,"Long story short I went through a few years of restriction and being underweight, then a few years of binging and being overweight, then a few MORE years of restriction and being underweight, now I’ve been binging/overweight for about a year and a half. I’ve also been battling depression and anxiety. I just turned 19 and after a bad school year last year, my parents were afraid to send me to college. But I had an okay summer and here I’ve been at college 3 hours away from home for about 2 months now. At first it was fine - then the stress came on and the binge/restrict cycle started again. At first I would just drive somewhere and binge on fast food in my car. But lately I’ve been binging on my roommates food when their not around and I feel so terribly. I feel like I can’t control myself - like an animal. I try to accept myself and tell myself I am worthy of being happy and healthy, but it’s hard. My roommates are so skinny and they talk about “being fat” and make me reassure them that they aren’t. I was doing well in school, but lately I haven’t been able to focus. I’m really afraid that I’m going to have to drop out of school because I’ll fail and then I’ll be dependent on my family forever. But then a part of me WANTS to do that - a part of me WANTS someone to say “even though she’s not skinny anymore, she needs help” and take me somewhere to get help 24/7. But I know that would cost so much money and then I would disappoint my family by wasting their money and ahhh I don’t know what to do.",eating-disorders
Dealing with pregnancy in recovery,"Hey, I am new to this group and am curious as to how it all works. I wanted to share a situation I find myself in at the moment. I have suffered from bulimia, anerexia and binge eating (at different periods) since I was 11 and have only found recovery (or at least normal eating patterns) about two years back. I am 35. Myself and my husband are thrilled that my body has recovered enough to succeed and I am almost past the 1st trimester.
I am struggling with so many aspects of the pregnancy though and my eating disorder is delighted with the opportunity to talk to me again. I have noticed myself counting calories again and the feeling of bloat and fullness is such a trigger (strangely to eat more). Purging hasnt come to mind thank goodness, but I have been feeling very guilty if i miss some yoga or movement in the day. I have gained weight already and am needing new clothes and my eating disorder is telling me I am spiralling out of control.
I am lucky that I have some supports here such as a therapist and some people I know in recovery but the day to day feelings seem so familiar I am afraid of missing the pregnancy and this time in my life trying to get past the body image and food thoughts. I feel stuck in my head. 
If anyone has been through pregnancy in recovery, I would love to hear how you got through and how it affected your recovery.
Love to all with this horrible illness. XX",eating-disorders

Talking works.,"I was so upset last night, crying and had feeling to binge eat. I went to the store to grab milk and bread for my mom and two girls from one of my classes who don't like me were talking about me saying the paper I read in class was horrible and they were picking it apart. I grabbed food and went home crying and grabbed food to bringe eat and my friend text me said thinking about you are you ok. I told her everything but the feeling to binge eat. We talked for a while and then that feeling went away. I don't like people being mean. ",eating-disorders
emotional roller coaster,"For me, recovering from E.D. is like an emotional roller coaster. It's been 4 months now. My therapist says I'm suppose to be working on accepting my body the way it is. I'm having extreme trouble doing that. But at least I'm not crying every time I c my body in the mirror. But I hate it soooooo very much. And I hate the way my body feels when I touch it. It grosses me out. I'm finally getting physically stronger. I'm able to walk 4 up to 40 minutes w/out walker. But I still feel like I'm just not getting enuf exercise. I'm in bed w/legs raised most of the day. I'm still home bound except 4 dr. appointments. It sucks. At the same time Im grateful 4 sooooo many things God has done 4 me and is doing in my life.",eating-disorders

I'm unable to exercise enuf 4 all the food I'm suppose to eat. I'm constantly bloated and just miserable. I truly miss weighing 90 lbs. I had endless energy and could move so freely considering I have severe rheamatoid arthritis.  I felt so comfortable in my skin and clothes. I use to take my measurements, but by how my clothes fit and what I look like is depressing enuf. I won't touch measuring tape or stand on the scale. I'm afraid I'll just start crying even more. Today is definitely a bad day 4 me.",eating-disorders
I want to get worse,"When I hear of eating disorder stories, I get so inspired... That is so fucked up but it's true of me. I can't help but think, ""I should get worse. I should relapse. Come on, these girls did it. You should get on their level. See how far you can go."" I really wish they motivated me to recover, but they really only do the opposite. They really make me want to be sick even more. I don't know where this reasoning of being as sick as possible stems from... It is quite sickening. Does anyone else feel the same?",eating-disorders
Wanting to purge so badly,"I'm 16 years old and I'm trying to recover from bulimia. This is my first post. I have been struggling since I was 14 or younger with eating disordered thoughts (calorie counting since 12 yrs old, restricting, exercising, critical about body, etc.) The past two years have been rough, but this year I have been trying to be better and recover. But sometimes my thoughts go into binge mode for no good reason, even though I have already eaten enough, making me want to eat everything. I usually don't listen to them, but because today I was upset due to a fight with my mom, I gave in to the thoughts as punishment. I knew I would feel bad afterwards, and even worse, that I wouldn't let myself purge it and thus make myself feel better. It wasn't even a binge, but I simply overate and I felt completely out of control. I felt like a slob. Usually I'll eat my meal slowly, with water in between sips, and drink water after the meal and not have anything else, but today I was so upset I did all the opposite. I didn't even drink water. So I just felt disgusting with myself and all of a sudden I got this really horrible anxiety and started to hyperventilate and sob. So now I'm just here on my bed, sobbing because I want to purge so badly. I don't think I'll ever get better. I need someone to talk to. I have no one. I'm lonely.",eating-disorders
Constantly Body Shamed,"My mother claims to only want what’s best for me. She thinks that by doing this, it will motivate me to eat more and try to break up with Edward (in other words, defeat/try to recover from my eating disorder). She constantly body shames me and says things like “being too skinny is unattractive” or “you’re too weak- you won’t be successful in life this way”. Occasionally, she would look at older pictures of me back when I had more meat on my body and say: “Look at you! I cannot even believe it is the same person! You used to look beautiful and healthy when you had meat on your arms and legs. Now look what has happened to you!” The mirror, Edward, and other peers tell me otherwise. This doesn’t motivate me to eat more. Instead, it just makes me want to get worse and worse. 
At this point, I don’t even try to get thinner, lose weight, or satisfy my always full stomach and not feeling like vomiting for once. I just want to die. I don’t not eat to get skinnier anymore. I just want to die sooner. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I’m a coward who takes the slow, but soon way out.",eating-disorders
"I Don't Care, but I'm Scared","I don't really care about my well-being and just my overall health. For instance, my mother constantly lectures me about not eating enough and how ""if I don't eat enough, I will die."" Honestly, I'm completely and utterly neutral about that. I don't really care if I'm going to have to be hospitalized for a long time. It won't matter to me if I will never free myself from Edward (nickname for Eating Disorder in a slightly less obvious way- kind of like Edward from Twilight Saga because he always appears unhealthy). Because of this, I constantly give in to everything Edward says (""don't eat this"", ""don't eat that"", ""lose some weight"", ""there are too many calories, sugar, and fat"", etc.). I don't want to not care about the consequences of my health. I want to be healthy, not disappoint or worry my family (because a smiliar thing happened to my brother...so they don't want to relive that trauma), and recover. However, I honestly really don't care what happens to me because at this moment, I just want to die. I also want to keep listening to Edward so I can just leave this world.",eating-disorders

Possible relapse?!,"Hi all, 

I haven't posted for a while because generally, although I would not say ""recovered"" I've been doing really well. 

However I had a baby in June and lost quite a lot of weight straight after. Not intentionally, perhaps due to breastfeeding and stress as my baby was premature and I've been having some relationship problems. 

I'm finding that I'm feeling guilty after eating out and anxious when I can't control food. I'm also feeling very low I esteem and emotionally sensitive. I feel like no one likes me and like I constantly have to prove myself, I'm stressing over everything! These are all feelings that I had when I was becoming poorly with anorexia many years ago. 

I am eating and although slim my friends say I don't look ""gaunt""  

What could be going on? Could these feelings and thoughts be triggered by being a low weight? Any advice or anyone been through similar? I want to be well for my family and baby! I was coping so well  I so want to get back to that. 

Thanks in advance. xxx",eating-disorders

Boy age 11 being starved by anorexic mother,"Hi, I have a nephew age 11 who has been put on a starvation diet (generally less than 900 cal per day) by his anorexic mother (my sister in law). His mother twists the truth and says he is eating healthily but his BMI is now 14.5 and he is on the 4th percentile on weight of boys his age. I have his confidence and I want to help him, but what can I do?
He loves his mother but is beginning to question her judgement on food he is allowed. He tells me things like ""she stopped giving me vitamin tablets because they contain too much sugar"" and ""she sends me to bed hungrey saying I should have eaten my dinner when all she gave me was disgusting salad"". He also says ""all she ever eats is salad, I don't think its very healthy, she never gives me meat now because she has stopped eating it"".
My beautiful nethew is being physologically tortured by his mother's controlling charactertics (mental state of needing to control) being directed onto her son. All she ever does is discipline him and exert her control. He is now failing at school as he decided to stop concentrating in reaction to her forcing him to do 2 hours maths every evening since he was 5 years old. She told him he was no good in maths and had to work harder. Over the past year he has had 3 different maths tutors each doing 90 mins a week of after schoool tutoring and his knowledge of maths has gone backwards in that time not forwards. Originally he was deliberately not listening/learning but now I fear that he has forgotten how to learn and concentrate.He certainly believes he can not do maths. This is a disaster for him as he really did have potential in maths and I saw his as an intelligent child. 
There are so many things not normal with my nethew's behaviour now, like neurotic behaviours and I see potential for self harm. It is critical I help him if i can. Please advise   ",eating-disorders

Parent of an adult restrictive eater,"I am a parent of a young adult married daughter.
She suffers from restrictive eating disorder for the last 4 years.  She has been married only a year and only recently has she opened up to her husband.
Whether afraid, overwhelmed or in denial he was not as supportive as we would have liked.  He is very slowly coming around and hopefully family therapy in a few weeks will help.
Her counselor suggested taking a year off beginning grad school or else go to a residential treatment program.
Her husband reluctantly supported 5 week program thinking that is all it would take and she wont need followup. Grad school starts in 3 days. If she goes to grad school the schedule will not allow her to attend counseling and dietary visits.  If she delays grad school which her husband doesnt support she feels he will guilt her or hold a grudge or worse leave her.
Am I wrong in thinking he is not being the loving and supportive spouse that he took vows to be or just being a parent?

I have chronic Lyme disease so this past January I cut out (cold turkey) dairy, gluten, and sugar from my diet, which made me lose a lot of weight.

Well in March, one girl scout cookie later I was off the deep end and I'm STILL struggling to get back to eating healthy. The past few months I've been so paranoid about my looks and eating habbits that I was ashamed to eat and would count calories like crazy and work out a ton... I had such a difficult relationship with food. But now that has slowly turned into binge eating. Going out of my way to the store to buy cookies to secretly eat in bed at night, never feeling satisfied, forcing myself to eat a lot of bad foods even when I have a terrible stomach bug, etc. It's getting out of hand and I'm gaining the weight back, and I am so ashamed about this.

Over and over again, fat-related dreams keep me up at night. I am aware that it’s because I’m kind of tall and have wide hips. Sometimes, I do excessive exercising when I don't need to. I can't help but recall when people said:
Wow! You're pretty heavy.
Lose some weight!
I can see your stomach bloating!
Your fat jiggles a lot when you walk.
She’s the fat one.
I think you got a little chubbier than before
I can't help but cry myself to sleep, wishing I was dead just thinking of those phrases, even if it's “just a joke”. This joke isn't full of laughs.",eating-disorders
Not Enough Water,"How many glasses of water do people say they must drink everyday again? 8 glasses? Well, I never really feel thirsty, at least not for water. I can barely finish one bottle without feeling drowsy or sick to the stomach. When I actually feel like my thirst needs to be quenched, it’s too late; I can’t get rid of the thirst.

New To This Group,"Hello. I just want to know whether or not I’m the only one who feels this: I feel like my stomach is trying to tell me that I’m hungry in some foreign language. It seems as if my brain doesn’t process that, therefore not feeling hungry. It keeps telling me: “I don’t feel it, therefore I’m not.” If I try to eat, I immediately feel full. My mind is telling me that I am force feeding myself, so I stop. It then tells me to worry about my bloating stomach, so I exercise to the point where I feel sick. I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have suggestions or can relate?",eating-disorders

Binge eating is the hardest addiction to break,"Binge eating is the hardest addiction to break for me. I used to be addicted to drugs, such as amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and nicotine (I'm still dependent on nicotine though but I'm clean from alcohol and illicit/prescription drug abuse for 2 years now). But the addiction is nothing compared to eating because you need to eat to live basically. This is the hardest thing I have ever been through in my life, I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO STOP!",eating-disorders
Joined a gym again,"I joined my local gym after almost 3 years of not going to the gym. I was severely addicted to working out during the height of my eating disorder. I developed an unhealthy relationship to weight lifting along with my ED. I took 3 years off after a move away from my gym, a pregnancy, and then working on my recovery. I was in no rush to get back into an u healthy relationship with the gym. I have giant fears of turning this gym membership into unhealthy behaviors. I’m worried it will start to affect my eating habits. I’ve been doing well with 2.5 years no binging/purging and no fear of food and being able to eat whatever I want. So now I had a surgery 1.5 weeks ago and cannot exercise. It’s been a struggle. My ED thoughts returned and I told myself that if I couldn’t exercise then I wouldn’t eat. It’s been a struggle to eat food and not start to label foods as ‘bad’. I had a few days of eating very little (on purpose). I’ve now gotten back to eating ‘normal’ and eating when I’m hungry and eating what I want. I can return to the gym in a weeks or so. I’m just worried about how this will affect my recovery. I don’t want to develop an unhealthy relationship with exercise and or food again. Ugh... I don’t know what I need right now. Just to vent I guess. ",eating-disorders

Let's get a streak going!,"Hello, I just joined this group today, and this is my first time posting here. I am a college student athlete, and this past year, I developed bulimia. The binging and purging has gradually increased in frequency and intensity. It has already impacted my athletic performance, and I am starting to worry that is going to hurt my social life and academic performance too, if it has not already. 
Despite this downhill trend, I am confident that I will get better, and I am hoping connecting with other people with eating disorders would help me get back on track. So, I'd love to hear about your stories, good and bad, and maybe we can start a 'streak' together (i.e., consecutive days without any unhealthy behaviors).
Looking forward to meeting you all, and best of luck in your recovery!!! <3<3<3

Shaming,"Haven't posted in a while as I haven't really felt very motivated or even encouraged to change... but had a really bad moment today and kind of am in desperate need for support. I know, I know, the times when you are least motivated and need encouragement are when you need to reach out for support the most but it took a bit more than that for me to do it. 
My mom has struggled with her self image her whole life. She has been under 120 for the entire time I've been alive, and is always working out and complaining she's ""too fat"". She gets help herself. For the past seven years, she has been insulting me, judging me, and criticizing my every choice regarding my body. Whether she gets crazy into my swimming as a means to control me that way, or whether she calls me fat, or just stares at me in disgust, she is always hurting me. I have had therapy with her, I call her out on it, other people call her out on it, and still nothing helps. For the first time in fucking years I have felt okay, or at least not depressed over my body, and yet one of her looks can send me spiraling back into bingeing. I feel helpless and so hurt. I have just this summer left living with her. Moving out over it is not an option. I just hate body-shamers.",eating-disorders
"Well, I Did It... for One Night","In the interest of having an accurate ultrasound today, I gave not eaten anything since 10pm last night (as per my specific instructions from the clinic).

How Baking is Healthier than Frying,"The baked food that you left by saying that it doesn’t look appetizing or tempting, is actually much healthier than your fried foods. You may not know but baked foods can cut down on your intake of calories and fats.
Eating healthy doesn’t mean you only have to consume fruits and vegetables in your daily diet but the cooking method also matter. 
 If you are fond of having deep-fried foods, switch to baking as soon as possible. It makes your dishes nutritious and you can even bake seafood, lean meat, poultry and vegetables. Learn baking with me and I will show how you can make things better.",eating-disorders

So Confused,"I don’t understand what is happening anymore. This time last year I had so much control and was restricting and controlling everything I ate. I wasn’t eating enough and therefore lost a bit of weight. I never became sickly thin (at least I didn’t think so), and never ended up in treatment or got an official diagnosis. I’ve been seeing a dietitian, who said she would diagnosis me as anorexic (although I’ve had a hard time fully believing her on this because I could never see it for myself) for about 8 months now though and things have changed. I no longer feel like I have control around food. Once I began to let go and listen to her advice/try to follow the meal plan, I’ve felt more and more out of control around food. I’m terrified and convinced I’m eating way too much. All I want to do is restrict and control everything again, but I haven’t been able to. I can sometimes make it through the day or even a week, but then I always lose control. I’m so freaked out and terrified that I’m eating too much. I feel like I’m constantly eating/eating too much. I’m just so confused as to what is happening and I don’t know what to do or what to think anymore. I’m tired of being frustrated and upset with myself when I never make it through the day without either eating too much than I had planned or eating something I’d planned on avoiding. I feel like a fake/like I was never sick to begin with. I just don’t know what’s happening anymore. I can’t tell if I’m in recovery from anorexia, or switched to having a different eating disorder, or still have anorexia because all I’ve wanted to do is restrict/tried to?? I just don’t know. Does this resonate with anyone else? How do I gain back at least some control?

ED Taking Over Life,"I’m so tired of my ED taking over my life. I have binged every single day this week. My dad went into surgery this week, I came home from my brother’s - who I miss a lot, I was alone a lot, none of my friends reply to my reaching out to them, and then they got together without me. I know these are all excuses, but it’s what my ED feeds on. Today I binged, missed an event I was supposed to go to because I didn’t feel well, and didn’t end up going to visit my dad in the hospital with my mom. My mom confronted me about it today, but in the worst way. She came in my room, sighed, and told me every single food she found missing. She kept asking me to go visit my dad with her and I kept saying no because I don’t want him to see me like this. She said, “I guess neither of us will see him then, and he’ll have to spend the night all alone.” She said he thinks I don’t like him. I feel terrible - I LOVE my dad, but I didn’t change my mind because going there would make me feel even worse. I’m just so tired of my ED, my parents pointing out everything that’s wrong with me, and crying about it. I just want to (pardon my language) kick my ED’s ass and end all of this drama!!!! I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself. ",eating-disorders
food,"I think I have a problem and it might turn into something bigger. And bigger isn't always better. I talked a lot about my change in environments when I moved away from home to pursue college and I slowly started to get an eating disorder. I don't like to think that I have one but my counselors and doctors say that I do, So that is what I will call it. It started getting even worse when I started counting calories along with taking note of all the things that I eat every day. I am also a gym instructor so I need to be eating, but turns out I barely eat anything anymore, because the numbers are all I think about. All I had today was a cup of white rice, 4 pieces of steamed broccoli and a few glasses of water. I fear that soon I will start throwing up my food just because It has been on my mind lately.

Lacking motivation,"I spent 2 months in a residential place being treated for anorexia/ bulimia followed by 3 months of partial hospitalizaton. Treatment ended kind of suddenly due to insurance issue and I went back to seeing my therapist once a week. My therapist does not specialize in eating disorders, but does provide support/help. I relapsed pretty soon after leaving outpatient treatment. Things have gotten progressively worse and I started to lose some weight again. I don't really know that I believe recovery is possible for me. I know a part of this is my depression talking, but it just feels like I am not strong enough. I know that my lack of motivation will only hold me back more, but where am I supposed to find motivation? I have a list somewhere that I made in residential of reasons why I want recovery. A lot of it has to do with being strong enough to do my job which I really do enjoy; however, I often feel like anyone can replace me and hence my contribution doesn't really matter. I feel that way about life. When it comes to other people, I don't put much emphasis on perfectionism, but when it comes to myself, I feel that if I cannpt be perfect then why be at all? Someone else can do better. All of this comes down to me feeling like a failure and thus, not really wanting to seek out recovery because I will only fail and even if I get better, i don't have a reason to be.",eating-disorders

"Research Study: Recovery, remission & relapse"," We are seeking people who have had therapy for an eating disorder and who live in or near Nottinghamshire in the UK to participate in confidential interviews about the terms “recovery”, “remission” and “relapse”. We are investigating how people view these terms and how they have been used in therapy. 

Eligible participants:
- experience of an eating disorder
- experience of therapy
- not currently in therapy
 
If you are interested, please contact sarah.mcdonald@ntu.ac.uk or jessica.williams@ntu.ac.uk directly. We can provide further information on the study to help you decide whether you wish to participate.
If you decide to take part in the interview, we will arrange an interview at a place and time convenient for you. This interview will cover two main areas; 1) your own ideas of remission, relapse and recovery and how these were formed, 2) your thoughts about a recently proposed criteria for these definitions. Your interview will be conducted in confidence by either Sarah or Jess, both academics working at Nottingham Trent University. It will be audio-recorded, and any names or identifiable information will be removed, using pseudonyms in the analysis, so you can be assured your contribution will remain anonymous. The recording of the interview will be stored securely at Nottingham Trent University, where it will be transcribed and analysed. If for any reason you decide after the interview that you wish for your data to be removed from the study, you are free to do so up to 28 days after the interview. You do not need to give any reason for withdrawing so please don’t worry.

The Snowball Effect,"This really sucks and I am caught in this vicious cycle again and I just really need a place to share my story and maybe get some support or something because I have kept this to myself for so long. Okay, so here it is.
It all started freshmen year when my friend started counting calories. She even had that stupid MyFitnessPal app to count her calories, and before that, she would literally write down everything she ate on scraps of paper. It was insane! At first, I thought it was so stupid. She would always comment on what I and other people ate and always say comments like i am so fat even though, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this, she was super fit and athletic and literally an XS. I was originally never the type, always just eating what I wanted and not worrying about it. But I think her fixation on all things weightloss got to my head, and before I knew it, I was doing it too.
I got a calorie counting app. Now I probably didn't need to lose weight, but once I saq that it worked because I lost like one or two pounds in a week, I was hooked. The fact that this little app could finally give me the skinny body I had never knew I wanted so much just made me that more addicted. Before I knew it, I was down to under 1000 calories a day and exercising constantly. I would literally bike for hours. Looking back, I felt shaky all the time and just physically and psychologically empty.
What they don't tell you about extreme weightloss is that not only do you get a freakily skinny body (though I never got to that skeleton-like unhealthy skinny), you also ungergo other changes due to the stress you put on your body from not getting enough nutrition. So not only was I unhappy about my weight and my body, I was now a 15 year old girl missing my period for months and losing my hair, my most prized attribute that I was actually proud of. I went from a thrick head of beautiful, black, trick hair to probably a third of the volume. It also became thinner. I just remember everyday being scared to take a shower because of how much hair would fall out. So much fell out each day that I am supprised I have any left at all. Of course my parents noticed, but I never told them that I knew why this was happening. I just suffered in silence.
But wait! I didn't even get to the real gag of the story. Right in the beginning of that summer, I was diagnosed with lupus. First my weight, then my hair, now I get stuck with a lifelong, uncureable disease! One of the triggers for lupus to manifest is stress, and there is not doubt in my mind that the stress I put on my body from practically starving myself triggered it. I feel ashamed for saying this, but when I think of this I really do get angry and blame it on my friend who led me to start counting calories  in the first place. 
I went through cycles of losing weight, bingeing every day for months and gaining it back, and then losing, and then gaining it back, all in 10+ lbs at a time. Probably around 20. I am now in a bingeing phase again. I just feel so sad. It is like at this point I am passed the point of ashamed. I want to tell someone, but I am scared at what opening up will do and how it will affect our relationship. Will they look at me or treat me differently? 
I am just so stressed about all of it. It doesn't help that because of lupus, I have to go to doctors appointments every month where they check my weight and will now see that I gained 10 lbs from last month alone.
I just really need some encouraging words and support because I just feel so over it all. Thanks",eating-disorders
Will I gain weight if I stop chewing nicotine gum?,"So I started chewing nicotine gum a couple months ago.

I just want to eat and eat and I think it’s partially an emotional thing because since my ED developed I’ve been having an extremely emotional relationship with food, which I think is typical of an ED, but it’s just really hard for me to ration myself I just overeat or don’t eat at all I know no in between and it’s really frustrating!

Maybe at first I used tea to help move my digestive system, but for the most part I ate normally, I didn’t have anything to hide, and I just felt better. I even ate foods that I had once restricted myself from eating entirely! Totally guilt-free! I was happier and I looked back at the way I had lived with bulimia just to notice that I was so so SO happy to be out of the eating disorder lifestyle. However, fall of 2017 (literally a year post-recovery...) I slowly slipped back into the lifestyle. It felt like on that day in the fall of 2016 I made a wish to stop bulimia, but my time ran out a year later.

It's neither new nor interesting. But it's mine. I live in Russia, in an ordinary cold Russian city,  big enough to feel small in it,  small enough to feel at times bored. I used to have a terrible binge n purge relationship with food. It started when I was 18 and didn't go away till I had a baby (so, it was with me for 7 years and nobody had a clue of what was going on and what I was going through). Three years ago I had a baby. After that everything started to change, both mentally and physically. I lost the weight that in my mind didn't let me love myself enough, I started to eat healthier, I started to care about myself so much more. I finally loved me. But now,  three years later, I feel lost again. That terrible,  that dark cloud is hanging over me again. It's coming back. Sense of no control, isolation, low self esteem. You know what I'm talking about. YOU KNOW. The problem is,  I've been sitting at home with my child for three years. My husband and I parted 2 years ago and got divorced. I've been working from home, I've been taking care of my child, I've been all alone. This sense of unbearable isolation is something I can't event describe (I don't know the right words in any language to do it). I started to binge again. I don't look like a person with an eating disorder,  belive me.  Like many of you. However, we all do have one thing in common - we want help. We want someone, at least one person to understand. Like, really understand. I want to find such a person. Please,  I know you're somewhere out there. Just let me know you exist. Lend me your hand,  I'll lend you mine. Love you already.

Did I binge?,"I have been binge-free for 2 weeks - the longest I have in SUCH a long time! I am so thankful and happy to have made it here, but I'm afraid I messed up. 
When I woke up this morning, I was super hungry and ate what I normally have for breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack all in one sitting. Afterwards, I was full, but not extremely full to the point where I felt sick. I went on a walk, went about my day, and just didn't have those meals at those times because I wasn't hungry. Then, I ate a normal dinner. 
The thing is, I have been on edge ALL DAY, wondering if this counted as a binge and if I would have to start over my counting the days of being ""binge-free."" I try to tell myself it wasn't a binge, that it was genuine hunger, but who else eats ALL of their meals and snacks in one sitting?? I don't know...",eating-disorders
"Hi, I’m New To This Group!","Hi, everyone!
   I’m new to this group. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Caleigh Miller, I’m 20. I live in New York. Over the years I have struggled with eating issues and sometimes body image issues. My weight has fluctuated multiple times since I became a teenager. Before this I never thought I had anorexia. Three years ago I developed gastritis, gastroparesis, IBS, and IBD. Those digestive issues made it hard to eat. I was definitely NOT not eating intentionally. Yet all my doctors claim I am. After being in and out of hospitals for years and getting total parenteral nutrition and gained most of my weight back I started to feel insecure with all the weight I gained. I started to tell myself, “I liked myself better when I was thinner. I need to start eating less.” For a couple months now my stomach and intestinal pain has been making it difficult for me to eat again, yet I don’t mind usually. In the last maybe 3 or 4 months I lost about 18 pounds. Somewhat intentionally yet somewhat unintentionally. I just feel that what is supposed to be my ideal body weight is too high and I feel out of shape a lot. My legs are my biggest issue. I just thought I’d share my story. I can’t wait to meet everyone!!!
Love,
Caleigh :)",eating-disorders

How to reach out for help,"I've been struggling with restrictive eating behaviors for about 8 months now, and I started seeing a counselor and nutritionist in December. It's not very consistent treatment, I've only had a few sessions of each. My counselor suggested intensive outpatient, which seems like too much of a commitment right now since I will be graduating college in two months. I'm consistently torn between so desperately wanting to recover, but not taking any action. I wake up every day saying that today I will eat all of my meals, and I will take a break from exercising, but every day I go back to my old habits. Some days I'll eat slightly more and start to think I'm back on track, but it's so hard to keep it up for more than one day.
My main concerns are restrictive eating and excessive exercising. 
I'm looking for advice on a couple of things: does anyone have any advice for more serious treatment than bimonthly counseling, but not as intense as an IOP?
Also: only one close friend knows that I'm struggling with this and has suggested that I reach out to some other people about it. I have a more distant friend who runs a fitness Instagram account and is very open about how she overcame her ED and her willingness to talk to people struggling. I was thinking about talking to her, or even telling my mom, but I'm not sure how. I'm starting to realize that I want and need help, but I feel anxious, guilty, and ashamed asking for it.",eating-disorders

My YoYo eating disorder,"I'm new.  I'm a 38 yo female. I work 3rd shift in healthcare (stressful job) and I am a mother of a 12 yo boy who is attending a cyber home school. I am also his learning coach (fancy name for a teacher). My 72 yo mother lives with me and I swear she is my 2nd child. Why am I telling you all of this?

Here it comes...
Hi. I'm a Running Mess and I have an eating disorder. Currently, I would classify myself as an emotional binge eater hanging for dear life over that bulemia ledge. What is up with the ""currently""?  I have had eating disorders since I was in my late teens. I have gone from one extreme to the next and back again over the past 20 years like a yoyo. Stress has always fueled my eating disorder fire. When I was about 19 it started with anorexia. I was working downtown in a stressful office environment. I started eating much smaller portions (like...just a half bagel in a day) and fewer meals and I walked and danced constantly. I would take pills that I knew would keep me awake and I would push myself to keep moving and barely eating. I would put the pills in a balled up piece of cake so the pill wouldn't bother my stomach and the sugar would keep me from feeling dizzy. My lack of food caused me to feel very sick which led me to believe it was the food that I WAS eating.  This led to my severe diversions to certain foods. I could tell you a list of things that I WOULD eat easier than foods that I would NOT eat. It was a small list. I have a picture of me back then. My collar bone was sticking out awkwardly and my face was pale and sagging. I looked very unhealthy. Why didn't anyone stop me? After a year or so I made a career change and started going to school for something I was passionate about. My life got simpler and the stress was easier. I relaxed and started eating. A few years pass and I unfortunately get laid off from my stress free job. I have to start working the stressful downtown office life again. Right back into food diversion and barely eating. Are we seeing a pattern yet? I think I'm controlling what I am putting in my mouth because I don't know how to control how I feel about the stress around me. (I know I'm self diagnosing. It's another character flaw of mine. I will be sure to look for that support thread as well :P ). I cycled through this routine one more time as I find another job with less stress but then fall into a horrible relationship with a heroin user (he just so happens to be my son's biological father). Having a child with a heroin user has a way of adding TONS of stress to your life. So, one more round of anorexia. This time it's worse. I think I was eating 12 pretzel nuggets a day and drinking lots of green tea (I thought the green tea was flushing the ""bad"" out of me). The thought of eating was literally giving me anxiety attacks. I was constantly fighting the urge to vomit. I wasn't eating anything though. What was I going to vomit? I somehow found my way into counseling. I called it severe anxiety. They called it something else... Through counseling and medicine I started to get better. Also, it doesn't hurt to throw the problem guy out of the picture as well (best thing I ever did for myself and my son). Time to put my life back together...
Fast forward many years later... Here I am within the past 6 1/2 years. I have had many stressful events. I have almost lost my house and I have lost a best friend of 20 years. I got through it all. No anorexic outbreaks (don't mind my wording). I met a wonderful man and got engaged. He helps me in so many ways. I learned something very powerful about exercise. It can be a great stress reliever when done in a healthy manner. I've learned to jog/run and I have set HEALTHY goals for myself. I've also learned the power of weightlifting for stress relief. Plus, it makes me feel pretty bad***. I refuse to starve myself again. These muscles need fuel to lift that heavy weight. I need carbs to run those miles while I prepare for that next race. Problem solved! Right? ...  Remember that ""currently"" from a little while ago?  I stated, ""Currently, I would classify myself as an emotional binge eater hanging for dear life over that bulemia ledge""... My job is pure stress. My home is pure stress. I only get 3 hours of sleep on most days. Every day is something else. I get no break. My days are long. I work 3rd shift. I have to sleep during the day when it's noisy. My body always hurts. EAT! EAT! So, I eat. I start out with what I should eat. I have 2 large eggs on toast with cheese and mayo. Yummy. I like to have a yogurt too. Gotta keep up that protein intake. Only, ... I had a stressful night at work and now my son doesn't understand how to multiply fractions after we've done it 1,000,000 times and my mother stays in bed until 3pm and my neighborhood is getting worse and making me feel uncomfortable and...oh that thing at work just still makes me so frustrated and I'm only going to be able to sleep for 2 hours if I go to sleep RIGHT NOW! STRESS! That breakfast 10 minutes ago just did not SATISFY ME I'll have some ice cream (2 overflowing bowls with a whole row of crunched up oreos) and I'll have some leftover turkey (a whole plate of cold turkey dipped in a huge mound of mayo) I feel like I am going to puke but I keep shoveling it in. GOOD! I hope I puke! I don't want to feel guilty later and I'm too chicken to stick my finger down my throat... WAIT! What am I actually thinking?... This is going too far. I know I am an emotional eater but... This happens to me at least 3-4 times a week. It used to be less frequent. I used to get scared when I thought about eating too much to the point of throwing up. Now, I welcome it. I want to eat until I puke. I think about forcing myself to vomit. It's the satisfaction of the binge without the guilt. I need help... ",eating-disorders
Shared office space,"I work in a communal office with our desks around the walls and a table in the middle and fridge/microwave/kettle to the side. Sometimes being with so many people itself it too much (although we don't work in this office all day). The table in the middle is communal and sometimes people will bring cake/treats, which is fine (I have allergies so can't have anyway). What really bothers me is when people spend all day talking about the damn cake...whether they're going to eat it or not, whether they should or not, why they shouldn't, who has had, who hasn't had, who might still have etc. etc. Then someone in the office goes on a diet and drools over the cake all day wanting it but not being allowed it. I want to just scream! If you want the cake eat it, if you don't don't have it, if you're on a diet silently wish for it, but please stop talking about food all the time! Nobody knows about my issues (directly at any rate), but this is very triggering and stressful for me.",eating-disorders
Newbie,"I have an eating disorder and it brought me to weight loss surgery. Much of my life food was keeping me from suicide. I was abused psychologically and verbally in my pre-teen and teenaged years. Food was comfort in times of pain and joy when I felt happiness. What was keeping me alive, was simultaneously killing me. In January of 2017, I became diabetic and hypertensive and was generally going downhill. I wish this on nobody, it's a hell so bad as to preclude accurate description. I am now almost two weeks post-op and by the estimation of the medical community, I should be feeling better but every day is a struggle. I am off 6 out of the 7 daily medications I needed in order to live yet I still struggle. What do I do to give myself joy in the absense of being able to go to the one thing that used to? I felt especially bad yesterday. I am not supposed to eat anything at this point yet I did. You know what's sick? I don't feel sad for eating the food, I feel sad that it tasted so empty and brought me no joy. Prior to surgery, the food I ate would have been an immediate pick-me-up. All I did was feel full devoid of any feeling which ended up making me feel worse.",eating-disorders
Scared as Hell,"
Okay, so I don’t know if this post belongs in the Eating Disorders support group, but since it pertains to my ED’s, here goes. In 2014, when I was a binge eater, I learned I had prediabetes. Immediately I reverted back to my 10-year-old anorexic self; I lived off of Diet Pepsi, sugar-free gum, diet pills, and the occasional handful of almonds. I exercised compulsively, even with a sprained ankle and conjunctivitis. As an anorexic, I experienced peripheral neuropathy and wounds would not heal. I could barely stand. It was amazing I functioned at all. That’s when my nighttime eating began. In 2015 I reverted back to my 13-year-old bulimic self. In 2016, I learned my A1C’s were high again, and I was devastated. Now my PCP wants me to get them checked again, and I am terrified. Even though recently I’ve gotten back to exercising 4-5 days a week and I still eat low-carb low-fat, I binge at night, which can’t be good for my blood sugar. Also, I’ve noticed I get what seems to be a major blood sugar drop right after I eat lunch, which scares me. No peripheral neuropathy, and at my last eye appointment my doctor told me that, apart from a minor change in my prescription, both eyes were in great condition—no retinal deterioration or anything. But I am petrified that my prediabetes has progressed to Type 2 diabetes at this point, and I know I will not be able to handle the news. My family and friends will shun me if I tell them, and that would finish me. I would no longer be a person; I’d be a Diabetic, like someone tattooed a large upper-case “D” onto my forehead. I’ve been in the Diabetes support group on DS in the past, and they do not understand my situation at all. When I tried to explain my ED’s to them, I got comments like, “Yeah, I feel bad when I pig out too,” or, “You should try (insert name of weight-loss OTC pill)—I’ve lost over 40 pounds on it!” All of which are unbelievably triggering for me. I’ve also had people in that group who claim they are doctors tell me to check my blood sugar and discuss my meds with my doctor. Okay, so while I can see the validity in those comments, what angers me is that, had they asked and not assumed, these doctors on DS would know that I don’t take any diabetes meds; not metformin, not glipizide, not insulin, nothing. I haven’t needed them. So I left that group. I am so conflicted over doing this. I have no idea whether or not my condition is genetic; no one in my family’s ever said as much, besides I doubt any one of them would know. I do, however, know how awful my binge eating was for years, and how much I eat every night when I am supposed to be sleeping. And all I can feel is sheer guilt and shame over something I probably did to myself.  ",eating-disorders

Coping with weight gain and taking pictures,"I have a really bad obsession with taking pictures of my body - it makes me feel like I'm conquering dysmorphia and seeing what I really look like (whereas I think the mirror can be more distorted). When I do this, I sometimes think I actually look really good or could handle losing more weight/body fat. I use the pictures as proof to myself that I still look healthy and maybe don't need to gain weight, despite the fact that my nutritionist thinks I need to gain 10 lbs at the very least.

I don't enjoy safe food as much as I used to. It is all hitting me that I am losing contact with food. I am not saying I don't get hungry or crave certain foods, it is just that I know that eating whatever I am craving is gonna get me downhill and it won't be a happy day.

I have a sugar and carb problem. The second I am alone and have access, I eat as much sugar or carbs as I can. I lie to my parents in order to eat in secret. My parents have found wrappers, and I grow so ashamed I just deny the whole thing yet they see right through it. My mom does not allow junk food in the house. A therapist of mine suggested she allow one, small ""junk food"" snack for me, but not only did I feel incredibly judged by her when I was eating it, but I also found myself finishing the snack off in one sitting. I feel so scared, and ashamed to ask for help or tell people about this.

I feel like a failure...,"Hi,
This is my first time on a discussion board, so I don't really know how it works. I guess I will just share a little bit about my story leading up to where I am now. I have been over-weight my entire life. I know that Eds cause people to see themselves in a way that isn't accurate, but I have been overweight. When I first started to get 'healthy' and 'fit' I weighed about 250lbs. I was really good at counting calories, and working out, and I began to lose weight. Soon, it became a lot of weight. In less than a year I was at nearly 150lbs. But, it wasn't enough, and I knew I was sick. 
Since then, I have sought treatment. I started eating. Now, I eat emotionally. I eat past full.
I am now at my highest weight, 275. I feel so disgusting. I am uncomfortable all the time. I also feel like a failure because I hate being the fat girl. Once I hit under 200lbs I promised myself I would never go back. I honestly don't know what to do. I want to lose weight because I am not comfortable. I know my partner doesn't find me attractive, and I want them to be able to. My sex drive is gone, because I can't stand myself, and don't feel sexy, and can't feel comfortable with sex. I am having a hard time walking and breathing. 
I am so lost. The only way I know how to lose weight is restricting and over-exercising. ",eating-disorders

I’ll eat something, then feel bad, then fast without eating anything for one to three days and then binge on food and then feel really bad, so I will fast again and then the cycle repeats itself. I think it’s actually turning into an eating disorder. I don’t know what to do anymore. ",eating-disorders
Depressed,"I was on recovery and I took good steps ,but my dad caught me relapsing and he put me down by yelling at me and letting me feel I’m so weak to not being able to stop this silly thing and I got extremely depressed that I started purging again

Feeling weird about recovery,"So I've been ""in recovery"" as of late November for an eating disorder I've had since 2006. Most of the time I've been white-knuckling my way through it; just forcing myself to eat more than my anxieties typically let me, and squashing my compulsions whenever I notice them coming up      . I see a therapist weekly, who has been helpful and really nonjudgemental. I'm about to be 2 weeks on prozac, which has helped my OCD symptoms more than I could have ever imagined. I would almost always have an anxiety attack if I ate past midnight, or before noon. I would also be compelled to check the calories on absolutely everything. It has gotten a lot better since the meds (especially after the initial craziness from the first couple days with it in my system were over). I haven't been able to gain much weight, but the fact that I've been maintaining more or less is a good sign. I decided to start having ensure in the mornings with my meds and vitamins so that I can up my calorie intake a little more.
It feels weird though, to be without the rituals that have been plaguing me for this long. All my other recovery attempts lasted for about a week before I freaked and started spiraling out of control again. I'm scared that another relapse is inevitable, but I've felt surprisingly level lately. If there was any doubt before, I'm now certain that I needed to be on prozac. I'm still struggling to physically eat three meals a day, but I'm having snacks whenever I can remember to. Once my doctor thinks I'm healthy enough, I'm going to begin strength training so that I can bring back some of the muscles I've lost over the years.

      Overall I just feel so...weird. I'm not hunting down laxatives all day, compulsively checking how many steps I've taken in a day, counting calories, checking the time, checking my weight, measuring my body, checking my weight again, etc.Its left me with all of this extra time that I'm not sure what to do with. That's actually part of why I ended up on this site.

Not sure what the future is going to be like, aside from the fact that I have another doctors appointment two months from now, and I'm pretty sure she's going to be monitoring my weight, which freaks me out. I asked to be weighed backwards when I went the last time, and I still have no idea what I weigh (aside from the fact that my doctor said that I'm ""a little on the thin side"", whatever that means). I'm worried with how I might feel once I start gaining weight and filling out my clothes again.I'm worried people might start to say things about it, that people will notice me getting bigger. Every single day I want to go back to restricting/fasting and eating laxatives/diet pills all day, but I'm determined to have a future",eating-disorders
The end of the day...,"My body is exhausted. I having throwing up all day long. So at first when I was eating a large amount of food I did not want to throw up but I did it once the other day and now its like everytime I eat. My anxiety is literally killing my chest. Ah there is so much going on. The mornings are great but its like as soon as I take that first bite that my entire day just goes down especially now that I have been purdging. I am trying to see a new therapist but it is taking forever! I am trying to do what I can; push off eating as late as possible, I write down ho I am feeling, my anxiey problems, and EVERYTHING I am eating.",eating-disorders
I feel like such a screw up,"I thought i finally had purging beat, i made it 18 months, i stopped when my shrink told me i was diabetic and he talked to me for 1 1/2 hours about the dangers of purging while diabetic, when my Dr found out iw as she called him to talk to me and tell me. I am blessed with good Drs that talk to each other to help me. Well for about 3 weeks the urges to purge have been back but i didnt tell anyone and i kept fighting them, Thursday night i gave it and did it and i feel so horrible since and like such a screw up. Why cant i beat this for good? I have struggled sicne 14 and i am now 33. My therapist said i need to ask for help and not try to do everythign on my own and use my DBT skills, she got on me but in a very caring way, not like my old therapists ive had. This one is wonderful and never makes me feel bad about myself. I had been scared to tell her because i started seeing her last march and havnet cut or until now purged since i been seeing her and i am 5 years sober and 4 years no smoking and almost 15 months cut free but this dang purging is back and now i want to do it every time i eat but my AA sponsors been keeping on me to make sure i dont but he cant always be there by phone theres goign to be times hes busy!

I am empty... but my stomach is full,"I have chronic pain in my stomach and the doctors have no explaination. I restricted my food like crazy this last month and recently stopped and I am binging like never before. I feel like I have no control over eating at all. I try to postpone eating in the mornign as long as possible becuase I know it only leads to more food. I eat so many sweets at night its unreal. I eat when I am full, when I feel sick or in pain, I hide my food and I hate eating around people because I am ashamed. I have always had a problem with either food or my weight. Just two days ago my aunt conforted me (being in the line of clinitions) saying she believes I have an eating disorder. I literally want to cry everytime I have put food in my mouth because I do not want to. I have no idea how to handle this or what to do and I do not want to keep going like but I have felt unable to control my food for months. I do not know who to talk to. I do however see a therapist tomorrow. ",eating-disorders
Long time ED,Hi all! I know I'm not alone in saying eating has been a struggle since my teens. I gained weight at 13 and ended up with an ED at 15 when I got my wisdom teeth taken out. I threw up everything I ate bc I was so sick and then I noticed that I lost at least 5 lbs from that. It was like a light bulb went off in my head. I ate very little and boned and purged. My parents found out and sent me to an eating disorder group. It was great and helped a lot. I stopped for awhile but started taking diet pills at 20 and didn't stop until 30. At 26 the binging and purging started again. I went to another group but I'm not sure it helped. At 33 I had my first child and then my last at 36. I'm 8 weeks post partum. I sometimes binge but less often Purge. I'm the heaviest I've even been and sometimes feel hopeless. I eat very well during the day but at night after dinner I snack a lot and eat in the middle of the night when I wake up for the kids. I'm working on a healthy eating plan but I wish I could just think normally about food.,eating-disorders
Stuck and confused,Is anyone available to talk for a bit? ,eating-disorders
Need a pep talk,I'm struggling right now. Back to restricting and I honestly CAN NOT be doing this for reasons so please please just someone who understands encourage me to eat something. It sounds so simple and maybe even a little ridiculous but I think hearing it from someone else with an ED would really help.,eating-disorders
It's too much!,I keep getting the feeling to binge eat and I can't make it go away. I'm not happy and I don't know what to do. ,eating-disorders
talking,Im not sure what I am doing here honestly. I have not yet been diagnosed with an ED but I always have struggled with body image even though I have been thin my whole life. I go through moments when I am stressed and anxious and I just stop eating. I tell myself I want to gain weight but every time I step on a scale and I have not gained or I have lost it feels like a small victory. And every time I see that I am not between 100 and 103 lbs I get stressed out and shut down slightly. I am studying the health sciences so I know the signs and symptoms of EDs and why they are bad but somehow I don't follow the 'rules' myself. I am currently seeing a dietitian but that is about it. ,eating-disorders
Conflicted,"I have struggled with disordered eating for 8 years now. From anorexia to binge eating, back to anorexia, and now here I am, binging more than ever before, extremely depressed, and I've gained 50 pounds in less than a year. 
I know I'm not okay, my parents know too. I'm 18, in my first semester of college, still living with my parents. We've tried therapy, medications, taking a break from therapy, switching medications, the whole shebang. 
My grades are poor, I feel sick physically and mentally 24/7, I don't go to class, which has never been a problem for me. Sometimes I will spend 3 or 4 days in a row in bed because I don't see the purpose in leaving it. 
My parents ask me how I'm doing and I say fine because I don't want to hurt them and tell them what I'm really feeling. Truthfully, I've been looking into a ""house"" for people with disordered eating. It's an hour away from where I live, offers individual and family therapy, and is a place to get away from things to fully focus on my health. I don't know if this is the best option for me but honestly I feel like it's worth a shot. 
There are a few things I'm afraid of though: telling my parents, being away from my family, and not being sick enough. I feel like my parents will think it's too extreme. They will probably be angry at me for wanting to put school/work on pause to do this. Plus my baby nephew was just born and I don't want to miss this time in his life. Also, I know the people who live there are probably all so skinny and I don't deserve a place there.
I don't know...if anyone has any sort of experience in this situation, advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for all of your support always. ",eating-disorders
Realizing the problem,"This is the first time I've ever openly admitted that I have a problem with food. I used to be very athletic but a picky eater, but when I stopped playing sports and didn't change what I ate, I gained a lot of weight to the point that I'm about 60 pounds overweight. I'm very unhappy with where I am right now when it comes to weight, but I guess that this is going to be the first step for me. my whole family is very much into fitness, so a lot of the time I feel like the black sheep in the family. There's a lot of times where I will just binge eat. I feel like I always have to overeat to prove some point and if I feel too full I'll make myself sick. I'm hoping that by getting a better handle on food and how I feel about it that I'll be able to make a change in my life and live healthier. ",eating-disorders

New to ED,"Hello all, 

I am fairly new to the concept of having an eating disorder, as I always knew I had a weird relationship with my body/eating but I never fully adressed it and yo-yo'd with it by eating healthy and working out until I burnt out and then going through a long binge period followed by another health kick. 
I have learned and understand that food is just being used as a coping mechanism for me, like many other things and I am extra worried about food/exercise because I was told I was chubby a lot when I was a child. Now, as a thin but unhealthy internally adult, I struggle with health issues due to stress and avoiding difficult emotions by binging and other unhealthy behaviors I have used in the past. 
I feel so thankful to now be aware of the problem and be able to deal with it. After becoming aware, was it easier for you all to accept and begin healing faster? I know it is a journey, but if working on it every day- how quickly have you all seen success? ",eating-disorders

Been struggling with ED for the past 22 yrs!,"I've been struggling with extreme weight loss and binge-eating/weight gain for the past 22 years, ever since I became anorexic the summer before my sophomore year in high school. I'll lose weight, end up binge-eating, then gain it all back and then some and just repeat that vicious cycle over and over again. This ongoing struggle with weight and food has consumed me and ruined my life. I've wasted the last 22 years because of it and continue to waste my life away. I am 37 years old and have amounted to nothing - couldn't finish school, keep a job, make friends, have a social life, fall in love, etc. Every time I end up bingeing and gaining weight, I run away to South Korea to live with my mother so that I can avoid having people I know me see me with the weight gain. In Korea, I just try to focus on losing weight again and live as a hermit because I don't have any friends here. I was on yet another one of my weight loss kickstarts and have lost a considerable amount of weight, but then I started to have all these cravings and urges to binge again. I couldn't fight it any longer and binged today. I'm afraid I'll continue to binge and gain all the weight back (and more) again, like I always end up doing. I'm sick and tired of living like this, having my constant battle with weight and food consume my entire life like this. I need help. I want this to stop so that I can finally live a somewhat fulfilling life. Since I'm not employed, have no health insurance, and am a foreigner here in Korea, getting professional help is really expensive, and my mother refuses to dish out all that money, which is understandable, given that I'm a grown adult and all. I don't know what to do. I'm feeling more and more hopeless. I need this cycle to stop. I need to live. This is no way to live a life. What can I do???",eating-disorders

New here but not to EDs,"And I'm back, to EDs that is...  I went through mega trauma this summer that has unraveled my life to say the least.  Unfortunately, my go-to control coping mechanism is my ED.  I'm in mega therapy for what happened, and we really can't get into the trauma as we are focusing on my eating.  I'm just so sad that this is back.  It will be 25 years of fighting this come March :(",eating-disorders
Links?,"Hi I'm new here. 
I'm wondering if anyone feels their ED is linked to some other trauma in your life. 
I was beaten by my so called dad while being told a thick and fat and ugly I was for several years and the minute I got away from him was the moment I lost control (I thought I had control) over my eating. I started off by making myself sick after every meal and slowly stopped eating altogether apart from the old piece of fruit or something. 
For many years now I have felt like I was in control but recently I've been having nightmares and reliving the beatings and I can feel myself losing control again. I'm trying hard not to and will force myself to eat a meal but the urge to be sick is over whelming and I have to sit on my hands to stop myself from shoving them down my throat. I've been chatting with my best friend who has had a mild ED and understands the mentality and has been there since my problems started and before. 
Do I need to start seeing my therapist again? Can people really battle it without professional help? ",eating-disorders

Anorexia Recovery Turned Orthorexia,"I was wondering if anyone had any tips on “normalizing” my thought pattern/relationship with healthy food and exercise. I’m at a good BMI and feeling on top of the world... I look healthy for once (hair, skin, nails especially),my bdd has mainly disappeared (thank God!!), and I’m not hiding from going out and enjoying myself.. so there have been a lot of improvements! But the one struggle I’m left with is now being obsessed (only comfortable) with healthy eating and exercising/moving/fidgeting every single day. If I have a lazy day or even try to sit through a movie, I feel so guilty for not moving or getting something done. Just sitting here, writing this, I’m thinking I need to find a YouTube workout to do. It feels like working out is my justification for eating normal amounts of food. Do I eat my full meals even if I feel guilty? YES! I’m not falling back into restricting, but it’s so hard, mentally, to not get depressed if I feel like I didn’t do enough in a day.

Trying to Figure Out WHY..,"I have no idea why, but I cannot seem to eat correctly anymore. I have always been self-conscious about my weight, and grew up with a step mom who would take pictures of me when I got ""too fat"" and tell me this is what you look like.. It's a problem! So, ever since then I have this HUGE anxiety about my weight, and for a while I had it all under control. I used to exercise, and eat so healthy, now I can't exercise because I do not eat enough to support my own body weight. I feel lost in this struggle and I am trying to figure out if an eating disorder is at the root of my problems.. I used to eat ALOT when I was bored, stressed, and depressed, but when I noticed myself gaining weight, I stopped doing that. Now, I am convinced that I will choke to death if I eat anything.. I am not sure if this is some weird coping mechanism that is at play to help me not gain weight.. but I need help. 
I started nursing school last year in August, and ever since then, I have been a total mess! I wish I would have never started, my anxiety has gotten that bad. There is a series of thoughts that race through my mind when I eat like, ""OH MY GOSH.. YOUR CHOKING"" or ""there's something in your throat"" so I refuse to eat because of that reason. When I was eating normally, I would think things like, "" you are getting fat, and you are going to die."" I saw myself as this huge person with nothing great about her, but now I see myself losing soo much weight that I think I will die as well. Has anyone else experienced this, or know if what I am experiencing sounds like an ED?

New and Lost,"Hi, I decided that I needed to reach out for help so I joined this group today. I've had my ED for 3 years now. I've tried so many times to quit but my anxiety gets the best of me and I relapse. 
I have always had an image problem growing up. I was a little overweight but not bad. But then I began working out, eating right, and losing the weight. The right way. 6 months after having my daughter and already at the best weight of my adult life, I for whatever reason decided to try to learn to purge. And I found out how. Ever since, its been an uncontrollable demon.
Now food absolutely TERRIFIES me. I don't even eat the meals my family eats at dinner BC I'm afraid I'll gain weight. I have a ""safe"" food list and I know how much I can have without gaining weight. Going out to eat gives me so much anxiety BC I have to invest so much time looking at the menu to see what meal I can consume that has the least amount of calories. But what I really want is that Burger, that pizza, and that burrito. And if I'm resorted to eating a pizza, you best believe I retreat to rid mysef of it. 
I'm even using my ADD and anxiety meds to my ED benefit as it helps me stay so focused on other things that I forget I'm starving. 
Its also been harder since they cut our ability to use the workout room at lunch so I am finding it hard to find time after work to get my routine in due to kids activities, etc. 
So I'm stuck. I do well for a few days or a few weeks and then my schedule changes, my family only has trigger food available, or I'm anxious and it forces a relapse. I just know it needs to stop. I know there's more to life than this. And I know how to lose weight the right way.... So now Im freaked out that my metabolism won't do a restart. I'm lost.",eating-disorders
Anyone Else?,"Like many others, I've been working on reaching full recovery for a very long time. So many times I thought I made it to the point where if I kept up what I had going, I would once and for all heal my relationship with food and be able to freeling interact with it. Eat when I'm hungry, stop when I'm full, have what I want when I want, be intentional about a healthy diet but carefree within those means. Unfortunately, the ""hard stuff"" isn't over because I'm still fighting with food so much. I'm angry at food and I need to heal that relationship. I honestly don't even know what I want to eat anymore, I don't want anything honestly because of the hurt relationship and negative feelings towards it. It has made me very depressed and I don't care about anything anymore because of this ditch I'm stuck in. I know food hasn't actually done anything to me, I'm the one who turned food into my enemy, so how do I make things right with food again? This is a completely disorganized rant, I understand, but does anyone get what I'm saying or have advice on what they did to ""make amends"" with food? Thank you so much for your time!

I Hate to Exercise,"And I think I've finally figured out why. One reason is that I am bored with the workouts I do. I get up at 3:45am so that by 4:30am, I've had enough time to force myself into exercise mentality. And have enough coffee. After my YouTube workout that I do on mute (so I don't wake my neighbors), I shower and get ready for work, then I head out for a 50-minute drive so that I'm at work by 7am. When I get off work, which is typically around 7pm, I'm burned out and I just want to go home and crash. I'm explaining all this to illustrate why I have to do these stupid workouts instead of physical activity that I actually enjoy. But as much as I blame the boredom, there's another aspect that I don't think I'd ever considered before... when I was anorexic, addicted to exercise, and popping pills 24/7, I exercised when I was sick. I exercised when I was hurt. I exercised as punishment. And that is how I still see it to an extent, I think. At this point, I associate exercise with pain, punishment, self hatred, and misery. I know we're all supposed to exercise because we love our bodies and because it makes us feel so frickin good. Yeah, fuck that. It does NOT make me feel good. Not in any way whatsoever. And I don't know how to fix this. I have to exercise, and those goddamn YouTube workouts on mute are the only way I can. But it's gotten to the point where I simply can't do it anymore. I have a horrific revulsion to those things, to the treadmill at the gym, to everything. I don't know how to like exercise. I can't do it anymore.",eating-disorders
weird bulimia-binge-eating limbo,"I honestly have just ignored my issues with food since the 7th grade (I’m a senior in HS now). I can without a doubt claim that during middle school-early HS I had anorexia. (I wasn’t diagnosed. I don’t know if that changes anything.) id eat one meal a day (dinner because family is there), and quit all calorie-containing drinks. Eventually it was just so easy to not eat. I liked the feeling of an empty stomach, thin, hungry, lightheaded, etc. 

Anyway blah blah fast forward to summer of sophomore year I attempt suicide and have been battling my treatment resistant depression/bipolar disorder ever since. My problem is, the meds, constant adjustments, made my eating habits really scattered, due to cravings or what not.

i ended up being in this fluctuation of binging and then starving myself, due to struggling with physical craving, and conditioned mental processes I guess. I gained weight since, and looking at old pictures of myself makes me want literally want to kill myself (I know it’s dramatic). Actually my weight fluctuates a lot. I have been and am obsessed with food. Always thinking about what I want to eat vs if I’ll actually allow myself to. 

Idk how I got here but my sugar cravings have been WICKED. I get a tiny taste, and then I can’t control myself. I’ll sit down and eat thousands of calories in desserts. Self hatred quickly ensues. 

So then I don’t eat. I skip as many meals as possible, that is, until I get a taste of something I like, and proceed to binge all over again:

i usally avoid food all together, for fear of binging, inciting guilt, and on forth. 

Itsgltten to the point where meals meals I can’t get out of, I go and cry in the bathroom afterwards. I used to throw up relatively regularly, now I rarely do. 

I always miss throwing up. I’ve noticed my mood is elevated slightly when I’m fasting. I can’t look at food without feeling like I’m fighting it. Feels like a battle of the wills. Battle between selfhatred and desire. It’s become dysfunctional. 
i want to not be so unreasonably stressed about food, it’s NECESSARY, but I also don’t to deal with the problem.",eating-disorders
Recovered or not?,"Hi everyone. I am new to this group, and have never really participated in the online forum before... but I am need of some support at the moment. 
I am what some may call a ""recovered"" bulimic. I use that term lightly because, well, are we ever really ""recovered""? That is my struggle at the moment. At the peak of my disorder I was binging and purging multiple times a day. Thankfully, thanks to Eating Disorders Anonymous and counseling help, those days are long gone. I found health and fitness 2+ years ago and I am in the best shape of my life. Most of all I am happy! But there are days those sinister feelings and thougths still creep into my mind. Days I feel ""too full"" or ""too heavy"" and those feelings of self doubt and dispare set in... and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't given in to old habits now and then. 
So here I am, years past the deepest depths of my disorder, yet still struggling. I need some hope that eventually these little creeping feelings will get better or that at least I will continue to learn how to rid myself of these feelings better.

To get more help or not?,"I'm new here, trying to find somewhere to get insight from people who may understand. I've struggled with EDNOS for about 13/14 years. It waxes and wanes in intensity depending on how I'm managing anxiety, and typically my restriction periods are when it's much worse as far as interfering with my life. That's where I'm at. I realize it's an issue that's on its way to out of control, but I also see it as the exact opposite; perfectly controlled so I'm having a very hard time as my therapist is strongly recommending I go in for partial hospitalization or residential (to be determined at intake). Has anyone on here done either and have insight on how you felt prior? Were you ready or did you feel as resistant as I'm feeling? I just want a few more months and then maybe I'd feel more ready? ",eating-disorders
I'm not sure...,"I joined this group mostly because I want to get this off my chest. I've recently noticed some habits that are concerning me. I had a really rough time last year, family stuff and work stuff combined and there was a period of about five months where I just couldn't catch a break. I didn't notice it at the time, but I think I started using eating/exercise as a way of maintaining control over something in my life. I have a strict work out routine (I work one to two times a day 7 days a week) and the thought of missing a work out causes me massive anxiety (it's really fun considering I'm in an ongoing battle with social and mild general anxiety); I actually rearrange my life and activities so that I can exercise and I won't participate in anything that disrupts my work out routine. Exercise is a form of punishment for me. If I do happen to eat something outside my usual routine for whatever reason, I'll puncish myself by doing extra reps or something like that. I also follow a strict routine with food - I have a set of meals that I eat each week and I don't deviate from it at all. This includes measuring out each component of my meals and never cooking with fats. I should probably add here that I'm not an athlete or anything, it's just a routine I follow.
I've noticed that my eating habits are directly related to my stress/anxiety levels. As my anxiety increases, the control I exert over my eating and exercise habits increases. On top of this I can't get passed the imperfections in my body. My roommate is always telling me that I'm tiny and skinny, but all I see is the rolls on my stomach and the fat on my legs and this only motivates me to continue doing what I'm doing so that I don't gain weight (something I'm insanely afraid of). I've only recently noticed this and I was only mildly concerned about it all until the previous weekend when I caught myself seriously considering skipping dinner because I was stressed out over a family argument and I felt like I was drowning.
This was a bit of a long spiel, but I guess I want to know if this is something to be concerned about? Is it something I should seek help for? (I have experience as a mental health professional, so I want to make sure that I'm not overreacting and just playing at diagnosing myself).

Have to find something to help me stop this!!!,"I have been having a hard time the last few weeks and, I'm acting like  everything is okay and it's really not. It's finally getting to me now and making me upset and I am not just having a hard time with binge eating, I'm not eating all of my food and when I'm with my parents and sister and they leave the table I throw it away and act like I ate it and do everything to not give into the feeling to not binge eat that night. Now I don't know why, but I have been getting the feeling the last few days to make myself sick after I eat. I have never done that before and I have been getting out of the house and going for walks with music and trying to not give into this now. I don't know what to do or what is wrong with me. ",eating-disorders

Questions about getting help,"I want to get help but I have some fears associated with this. If anyone has sought professional help before, I’d appreciate your input. 
First of all, I’ve called national hotlines in the past and they always say that the only treatment is inpatient therapy. That is not something I’m willing to do now or ever.
I think I am willing to discuss this with a doctor and/or therapist, but can they in any way commit me or tell my family through either direct or indirect means? Can I decline their recommendations without fear of being forced into anything? 
I had a few good weeks in the fall, but then I went right back to B&P when I put on a few pounds. I can’t get over my body image issues. I thought I could get this under control on my own but I can’t. My will only lasts a few weeks at a time and then my relapse goes much longer before I can muster the strength to try again. I don’t know why I hate my body so much, but I don’t hate my life and I want to stop wasting it.",eating-disorders

Too much!,"I'm so angry and upset right now and because I feel like this I started eating junk food and I didn't care anymore. I don't care anymore, about this eating disorder.

Surprising,"So I haven't posted in this group since I've been on this site because my ED hasn't really been a huge struggle for me the last few months. It's weird because I've had so many horrible things happening and I've been so stressed out that usually I'd fall deep into my ED, but I haven't really done that. I've mostly struggled with my depression and slipping back into self-harm. I now myself, and I know that usually when I'm self-harming, I don't struggle with my ED as much and vise versa. But sometimes both rear their ugly heads. I guess not this time. I think it's been probably about 2 months since I last purged. Which is great. But tonight, I felt that urge come back for some reason. Maybe it's because I am starting to feel slightly better (seriously...very minimal improvement, but it is something). Regardless of why I feel this way again, it scares me. I haven't been eating very much because I've been so depressed. I eat one meal a day, maybe two some days. This is not really intentional either. I just am not hungry. So I've lost weight this holiday season which is not normal for me. My twisted ED side says ""just be happy you lost weight no matter how it happened"" but the rational side of me says ""no, that isn't healthy."" I don't know what to think or feel about this right now. I ate lunch at like 3:00pm today and had dinner about 10:15pm, which is becoming typical for me. But I feel guilty. Like I ate too much. I know reasonably I really didn't, especially since I only ate twice. But that irrational ED in my head says I screwed up. I don't know.
Anyway, that just needed to be put out there for someone to see I guess. I needed to get that out before I do something I will regret. Thanks for listening, whoever does.",eating-disorders

Married and alone,Anyone out there married and still feel all alone? ,loneliness
So lonely that I’m numb,"I sit here alone again and in the depths of my despair I finally decide to reach out to see if anyone else is there. 
My ex husband cheated on me 6 years ago (after 20 years together) and just walked out in a whim one night leaving me as a single mother.
I truly feared that I would never trust anyone again and never thought I would open my heart up until I fell hard for a guy at work after he told me all the things I had always wanted to hear, he wasn't even my 'type', it just happened. Probably my low self esteem i would say. A year down the track and he won't commit to me (it's a whole other story). Anyway I don't want to dwell on that now but he's showing me all the same signs of losing interest in me and I can't help but wonder, how do I always end up here?
I am always the one lifting everyone else's spirits around me and I know why I do it, because I know what it's like to be lonely and at rock bottom.
Do people just initially like me because I make them feel good about themselves and then lose interest in me once they start feeling better about themselves and suck all the good stuff out of me? I'm tired of it, it's a never ending cycle.
It doesn't just happen with men, it happens with friends and in the workplace too.
People just use me up and toss me away.
It's exhausting and I can recognise it in myself but I can't change who I am and I truly care for others, too much it seems.
i just wonder, will I forever be alone? It sure seems like it. I'm scared to love, scared to trust and scared to commit but also desperate to love, desperate to trust and desperate to commit. I found my happy place when I became single (it was a horribly emotionally abusive marriage anyway) and I was in a good place until I fell in love again.
I think I'll forever have my walls up now, it's not worth it... but I feel so alone.",loneliness
Looking for Online Chat,"Hi. I have always been a loner and not by choice. In the past I have dealt with this by going to meetups with strangers that rarely evolved into actual friendships. Although I must say, the chance of success was much higher in L.A.

I feel like I am going to go crazy without anyone to talk to. So I am looking to chat online with folks. I am not interested in online discussion boards where people argue all the time. Suggestions?

I am loved by friends but sometimes I feel they don't really see me. Sometimes I feel invisible. A mirage. So far out of this world in my own self that I'm out of reach. But I don't want just any kind of friend and yet this pickiness has left me still desiring someone to laugh with. I hear of women who have been single for years because they are being way too picky with who they choose to marry. I feel like this is how I am when it comes to friendship. I'm way too picky and this leaves me alone as I type this. Alone as I go out to eat. Alone as I travel. Alone. ,loneliness
Forced to stay in due to not having people to meet,"Hi, I've literally just joined and signed-up.
For now I want to get something off my chest. Being forced to be on my own, not having anyone to meet-up with both in the day and in the night, seeing massive groups of friends and happy couples.
Although I do have friends most of them a) don't live in the area and b) are on the other side of town and c) are not reliable and interested in meeting up in the day.
If there were places you could go to on your own (like meetup events, dance classes, and other events) it wouldn't e anywhere near as bad.
The big social catch 22; you need people to meet people and b) you need to have people to meet with.
Even if you do have friends, they have a) moved away, b) become settled with a family or c) become busy it can be like having NO FRIENDS. When the only people available in the datme are people that NEVER reply to calls or texts, but only do so RE meeting in bars on Saturdays, that's like having NO FRIENDS. I've been there. It would be nice to have people my age to on walks, bike rides and swimmig with.
When the people you have available a) don't repond to texts, calls, nor reply to voicemails by phone or text & b) become uncontactable after agreeing to hypothetic 'someday' plans when I get in touch about ideas for bike rides.
It's especially painful seeing large groups of people in warm weather (I used to love warm weather, but now hate it). It's especially painful hearing on the radio about  'making the most' of the warm weather, it seems like EVERYONE but you has trillions of friends or the love of their life.
Even those people on their own, they're going to meet with friends or their partner, they're not going out for a walk (are they?). Worst case scenario is ALWAYS true.
Yeah, I know it's tail-end of lockdowns for covid. Here's the thing, the social environment in the small town is so crap under normal conditions that lockdown barely made a difference.

Newer state and still alone...,"I moved to a new state almost 4 years ago. I moved while going through a divorce, and I knew NO ONE. I have my dream career, and met my new husband here (who is my best friend), but I work from home (and travel occasionally).

I have volunteered at multiple animal rescues, but didn't have the time to meet anyone since it was short staffed and everyone was too busy to talk. I'm not comfortable with church groups. 
I just feel so alone and want one or 2 best friends who will be reliable and want close friendships. I miss my family back home, but they all have their own lives.

Dinner table,"I have a toddler and husband. Once they are done eating, they go do what they want. They are fast eaters and I am not. Every single night I cook and we eat and I'm always left not even half way done (I sit last due to getting their food for them) and they are already gone. My husband eats, then leaves to go smoke. My toddler, eats, washes his hands and then plays. 
Tonight though, I asked my husband if they could start waiting till I'm done to leave the table. He agreed that it painted a bad picture me eating alone every night. But that it wouldn't be fair to make him and our toddler ""suffer and wait for me to be done"".  I took that to heart. Talking to me, my company, waiting for me is considered suffering? I told him that was rude and to forget i said anything.  He got all mad & ended up throwing names at me and said it was just me nit picking. 
I grew up that nobody left the table until everyone was done. 
He grew up the kids eat and the parents eat in front of the TV. 

Idk who is right or who is wrong. It's been an hour and he's still mad that I'm hurt. He's not happy that I'm still sad over the situation.

I just don’t get it,"(Posted elsewhere also)

this might be the right page it might not, but things become a greater struggle everyday, I am 40 I am male, I am terrified and intimidated by everyone in this world without exception. Have never had anything in the way of relationships, same really for intimacy, or even online. Now the thing that caused a break in my mind which bought me here was well long term media and reality based, you see I have spent my life being the best person I have the capacity to be, my Aspergers affects my ability to read social cues aswell but yeah. 

Everything seems to contradict so my mind melts down to the point of physical illness, cause I can’t comprehend and I can’t be that. I have always thought being respectful, loving, compassionate and equal was right but then in music, movies, tv, literature (literature is a stretch) and even within reality,  you are told and see that this is not what people want, people want to be dominated, forced, violence (towards others and by definition towards them). You hear people say things like they want, love, respect, equality, their partner to be emotionally available, and then they pick up some crap like 50 shades of grey, or start dating someone that was fighting in the pub, I don’t get it and I can never be that person, kinda like the don’t objectify me 10 minutes later post a photo in a bikini without your head even in the shot, now this can also be translated for women as well of course. 

This is not all encompassing I am sure there are others out there, but we don’t get to see them as much anymore. It just feels that at every moment we need to be a completely different person to be good enough for anyone. There is more to this but I am trying to limit potential triggers for people.

i will possibly never find love, even like is a stretch, but despite the pain I can’t be what I am incapable of being. So I am limited to loving myself, this is fine but lacks the comfort and tactile enjoyments that come with love, but perhaps love is just a by-product of my idealistic mind.",loneliness

So I guess that everyone else goes out and socializes on a daily basis and they are really missing doing so. Whereas meanwhile, I'm going to work, going home, going to the grocery store just like I always did before any of this happened. Only now, I can't sit down at a restaurant to eat on weekends and I can't take the occasional weekend trip to do an activity with the kids. But other than that, nothing has really changed day to day beyond that.

Guess it shows how the ""social aspect"" of my life was truly missing. Again, I know it's my life and I shouldn't compare, but it's funny how it takes reading about this social distancing being a major ""thing"" for the average person to realize, wow, I really am pretty not average.

Worrying about Staying Single,"Hey everyone,
I think this is the first time that I've posted on the loneliness board. I'll try to make this as short as I can. So, I'm single. And for the most part, I haven't had a problem with it. I've had great friends, a great relationships with my mom, and on top of that, I'm an introvert who plays music and writes, which means that I actually love my alone time. I love living alone, I love sitting on my couch and watching sad movies alone, I love playing my piano alone, etc. On top of that I'm a social worker and so I've had meaningful work helping people which has brought me a lot of fulfillment. But, the other side of my life is that I struggle with mental health issues. I struggle with depression, insomnia and anxiety. And I don't know what's been happening, but since the pandemic my mental health issues have gotten worse.
Over the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about my singleness and gotten really depressed. But it's not because I'm desperate for a relationship because I'm not. But what's come up, is that I'm feeling like with all of my friends who are married or coupled...I'm their second choice. That's really hard to say out loud because I feel like it sounds narcissistic. But, I'm just beginning to feel like I'm no one's best friend, except my mom's. I'm no one's first choice. I was bullied a lot growing up and have some trauma in my background, memories of which have been coming back up over the last few weeks. I feel very blessed to have my mom, but she has cancer and has been feeling very weak lately and I haven't been able to see her due to the pandemic and stay at home orders. 
But again, I'm 33, and I'm starting to feel very lonely. In a way that I never have before. I'm starting to feel like if I don't get into a relationship, I won't have security, I won't be a priority for anyone, I won't be anyone's best friend. On top of that, when of my good friends who is married and now pregnant, said that her husband is her best friend, and that since she's been married she hasn't needed her friends as much. There was more to this conversation and she didn't mean anything negative by it. But, it's added to these feelings. Does anyone have any advice? Or can they relate? I don't want to get into a relationship because I'm scared of being alone or because I'm scared of not being needed. ",loneliness

Suicide,Just texted my wife about my thoughts. Will see how this goes.,loneliness
always the outsider,"Today my mind is revisiting how i have always been the outsider in life.
I grew up LDS Mormon and they shunned me for asking too many questions....primarily ""why"". my mind was always analitical and i had a hard time with belief and still do even though i try (not a mormon anymore they didn't want me).
As a kid i was always left out of things....mostly the usual kid bs but it kept going in my adult life. Most of the time i'm the person people only come to when they have problems but past that no one wants anything to do with me.
as far as my love life it's non existant at least since my divorce in 2007. I've never had a woman flirt with me or come on to me at all in my life and it gets to me. I know i'm not that attractive (physically and mentally) but i see guys thousands of times worse than me getting hit on all the time but something about me is apparently unaproachable and i don't talk about this stuff to very many and then it's only to those i have known for a long time and trust.

i just hope i'm not alone for the rest of my life like my dad is. he never remarried or anything after my mother.

i don't know today is just a crap day for me. constant reminders of how i am nothing.",loneliness
Feeling like an idiot,"Just needed to vent.
I found out some bad news about a health issue and shared it with people who I thought were my friends but they never reply back.
Most of the time, I find that when they have a problem, they will email me or hang out with me but when I have a problem, they ignore me.
I feel like such a fool for trusting them and thought they were my friends. I feel like a garbage can. It seems most of my life, people dump at me and not support me when I have issues and I feel like when can this pattern end.
Feeling lonely and depressed. Not sure how to be my own best friend.
Thank you for letting me share.

Missing my friend,I'm going to call my friend PCL. PCL and I have known eachother since we were 9. Dated in our early teens. Was my first kiss and love honestly. After HS we became very close(I married my HS sweetheart at age 19 we are still together-- RRF) All through my relationship with my husband PCL and I have been friends. We have periods of time where we don't see each other for months and barely talk and then we have periods where we see each other regularly and talk at least once a week. He comes to parties we throw and is even friends with my sister so has been around my family a lot. We haven't seen each other since October and have barely spoken. My gut is telling me something else is going on. My sister saw my friend PCL work friends and sibling a few weeks ago and they made her believe that PCL has actually been in love with me for awhile and it's just becoming too painful. I have three kids with my husband. We have been together 11 years. And most of those years have been rocky. The last three times I've seen PCL I've been intoxicated or my husband and I have been fighting. I'm starting to feel like I may have said or did something to hurt him or just make him not want to be apart of my mess anymore. I emailed him five days ago catching him up on my life and asking him about his. I also expressed that I had a gut feeling that something was going on and that I know the last few times I'd seen him had been messy and I'm sorry. He hasn't replied. If he does have feelings for me I don't want to hurt him anymore than I might have already but for me I just need to know what's going on. That might seem selfish but it's really negatively impacting my mental state. ,loneliness

Kind of down today,"Nothing really wrong but just feeling down.  Mom seems to be improving which is good.

Relieved to see other posts on loneliness,"Though I would never wish it upon anyone, I am immensely relieved to see other posts on loneliness. I have struggled with loneliness since I was a child. Most of my life I've remained busy with school, work, being a single mom and it wasn't such a constant companion. My son is now grown, I married for the first time and I no longer work because we move every year or so for my husbands job. I've never felt so alone. I find myself craving my husband's affection and feel needy and insecure like never before. We had a marital issue last fall (his actions) and have been actively working on our relationship since but my feelings of being alone are relentless. I'm scared to talk about it with my husband because I think he'll take it personally and he may not understand that its something of mine and I certainly don't want the misunderstanding or an argument. Besides I don't entirely understand myself so I'm not prepared to discuss it. I just want to say thank you to everyone that has posted on this subject. Just knowing others struggle with these feelings makes me feel a little better. Take care, be well.. Let's all try and live our best!",loneliness

It feels empty and people always say that it's internal. I look for friends to talk to all the time but of course they have lives too.

What does a typical day consist of?,"Hi my fellow lonely people,
I was wondering what a typical day in the life of a lonely person looks like, if there is such a thing? How do you fill your time and how often do you socialize, if you do at all?

To tell you a quick summary about me and my day, I'm naturally an introvert, so I mostly keep to myself. My top introvert activites consist of reading, running, and gardening. I have one friend who I only occasionally go out to eat with. Otherwise, it's mostly time spent with the wife and kids. I know what you're thinking - how can I be lonely when I have a wife and kids? Well in my case, these relationships just aren't the same as having a really close friend. Any other people who are married let me know your opinion on this. Spouse vs. close friend is an entirely different kind of relationship.",loneliness

Imagine loneliness of the past,"It occurred to me the other day how much worse it must have been to be isolated/lonely for past generations.

New City,"I recently moved to a new city... NYC to be specific. As expected, it's been a huge change and shift in my life. Being the new kid in such a huge city with millions of people has been exciting yet very lonely for the most part. I started living with my friend of 10 years, so in that regard I already knew someone. Most of the people in my life from acquaintances to known faces are friends of this person, therefore I truly don't feel like I've made true friendships with any of them. That's not a goal of mine, but as the days go by it amplifies this feeling of knowing for a fact that I have no friends of my own in this city. Now in July it'll be a year since I've been here. My work is great in the sense of having a steady income accompanied by having room to grow in the company. Funnily enough I'm the youngest in my office (I'm 30) and everyone is either married and/or older than me. There's no way I can establish a friendship with my coworkers outside of work given the huge differences from personalities and upbringings there are among us. In other words, I'm not living the ""NY dream"" of having a supple circle and people to be myself with. I feel lost in a way and having to turn to myself for the most part. I know it'll take from me to put myself out there more and socialize by going to events and such, but it is hard when you're constantly face with the fact of how behind you're in that department in your life. Failed relationships will forever haunt me, most of the time preventing me from making new connections, because at the end people are unreliable. I am AWARE that energy and spirit comes from within and I shouldn't need a support system from friends and connections to feel whole, but at the same time it would be nice to have that in my life. I truly do feel that human connection is an essecial part of feeling alive. As for now I'm new in this community seeking clarity and opinions and the comfort of knowing I'm not alone with these type of dilema and issue. Hugs and strength to everyone out there! Thank you for reading and forgive the scattered thoughts. ",loneliness

I really miss my hometown,"I moved to this area, 200 miles from my hometown, in 1992 when I got married. My husband and I lived here until 2017, when he passed away. I have no family in this area and I really miss my husband. I had some friends when I worked but now I've lost my job and no longer am in touch with those friends. I'm living in a personal care home and it seems like everyone here is a local except me. This area never felt like home. I want to move back to my hometown so badly but I don't know how I can do it financially, since I'm now on Social Security. I just can't stand the thought of living the rest of my life in this place. I'm so lonely and I have no connections with anyone. It seems like I was happiest when I felt like part of a group and there are no groups in this area for me to join. My hometown had plenty of support groups and therapy groups. I got alot of benefit from them and met some really nice people. I miss that so much. I miss my cats--I had a cat since 1979--and I can't have one here. My life just feels so empty. It feels like I have no purpose and nothing to look forward to. And I don't know how to change that.

She lives about 15 mins away and has 2 children which I never met. A boy and a girl.I think they are about 14 and12. ( not sure) My oldest Son only calls Me near Christmas time and he lives about 15 mins away.He has no kids . My youngest son  has 2 little girls. One is 17 and one is 10. I only hear from him twice a year . Christmas time and in Spring  near Mothers day. He lives about 45 mins away. I understand they are busy with their own lives and families etc but they could at least call me on My Birthday, etc.  I used to watch the girls when they were little . 3 days a week for about 10 hrs or so. Now I only see them 2 days a year. I miss them so much. I cry every single day. I have lots of Health issues and noone ever calls to check on Me. I could be lying there dead and noone would know  for Months. I have no friends. I live in a senior highrise apt bldg and noone in here likes Me. I can tell. I just stay in My apt and mind my own business. I hate living here .I am alone every single day. I go to restaurants alone. I go to the stores alone. I take walks alone. I have noone . none at all.

I Feel so Lonley,"I have no friends. It has never bothered me before, but has started bothering me more as I have gotten older, I am now in my mid 20’s, and I have never felt so lonely.
I still live with my parents and Sister. We are quite a close family, and I am especially close with my Sister, however I feel unable to bring the subject up with them as I feel ashamed. We are quite a reserved family and my Mum especially, due to her lack in confidence, has always gone on about how no-body likes us as a family. I think subconsciously this has knocked my confidence trusting people and making friends, as I would hate to force myself on people. 
I have a very busy lifestyle that I love and wouldnt change for the world, but doesn't leave me with much time, I am up at 6am and don’t get home until around 7.30pm, which hasn't helped with making/keeping friends as I feel I would constantly be having to put them second to my lifestyle. 
I also really struggle being myself around people I don't know. At home my close family would probably say I am loud and say I talk far too much, however I really struggle coming out my shell outside of my comfort zone and I often get told I am really quiet and I think this leaves me coming across weird and unapproachable.
Is there anyone else that is/was in a similar situation that has managed to overcome it?

Hanging on by thread with gal I cant let go of!,"This just seems me needing to say I sent a cute doggie selfie card I bought at car wash to gal that has no romantic interest in me.
She sent me payment of outstanding debt recently. We texted just once since. I decided I wanted to give her a gift card that I get fifty percent off buying. Told her updates on house I bought in card and thanked her for her helping me one day she came to help me. Put $25 gift card to Panera bread co where I work in it! Put stamp on it and put in my mailbox to go out.
last ditch effort? Maybe? I just hate rejection and she is a introvert. She hasn't been affectionate ever towards me! I gotta let it go!

I've had to become ok with being alone for the rest of my life, because it's very possible that its going to happen. It makes me feel needy and unworthy.

Strangers vs having someone close,"This is not a critism of well meaning people but maybe an eye opener for some? I don’t know about anyone else but I find it puzzling that lonely people are told to join clubs, do volunteering etc. as if we were too stupid to think of that and hadn’t already tried it hundreds of times. I think many people think loneliness is a type of boredom. Go to a library they say. When has anyone ever rushed up to you at a library wanting to be your life long friend? Even volunteering groups and clubs can be very cliquey and marginalise anyone that they don’t want in their group exactly the same as wider society. It may make you feel like more of a failure if it doesn’t work out and enables the advice giver to feel smug about solving your problems but you just weren’t up to it. Add social anxiety, shyness, disability, mental health issues or other challenges in and it can be a bit soul destroying not to be able to change anything or be rejected yet again.  I keep very busy and talk to an endless stream of strangers often. If it was that simple none of us would be lonely. What do you think?",loneliness

I joined support groups hoping to find friends,"I have felt this heavy loneliness for almost 4 years now. My job has required that I move frequently, and each move I have found it harder to make friends. I have great friends but they all live so far away, and I just don't feel connected.

I have a great connection and relationship with my husband but I miss the closeness of girlfriends. I have met people and thought we had great talks and I heard nothing from them. It gets tiring reaching out and getting minimal response. I have never been one to have an abundance of friends, but I have also never seemed to have such difficulty making friends. It has me questioning and analyzing everything I do. I make posts in Facebook support groups, and sometimes I actually go back and delete them, because I worry that I came off wrong, say the wrong thing.

Now they are attractive, no hate, but it hurts a whole lot. I feel behind and alone and I also have social anxiety so I retreat to myself even in conversations with more than 5 people.

Next year I graduate and I can’t even talk to people. I wanna go to college and go out and hook up etc, but how can I do that when I look ugly and apparently a majority of guys find my complexion ugly?

Should I Say How I Feel?,"The thing is it's been two months since we last talked. We've had back and forth before and I don't want to continue it. I want to tell him how I really feel but I keep mentally telling myself that 1) its been a couple of months and 2) he probably won't care any way. I want to say something but I'm too chicken s**t to say anything. I'm waiting for him to reach out and say something so I won't look crazy or clingy but I know that he's not going to reach out at all. I had to reach out to him and ask why he never reached out after the last text I sent him and he said because of the back and forth and he thought space was needed at the time. Honeslty, I don't believe but I want to get over him as well. Idk. If anyone has any advice, it would be helpful and grateful. Thanks.",loneliness

Alone but not lonely,"I don't like the term lonely. I'd rather say I'm alone. I don't mind being by myself and I definitely wouldn't mind having some to hang out with and talk too.

I can not do this to myself.",loneliness
Anxiety and loneliness go hand in hand,"Having bad anxiety and its making me feel so small and alone, because I feel like I am the one to blame. And I just want to disappear...

Here is what happened: The last week I was suffering from a sinus infection. It seems it took over a month of dental pain and then a persistent headache, when I finally went to see a dentist. Not to mention the begining of this year was so physically tiring which put a mental strain on me (had surgery and teeth extractions) and thinking about it I feel sad, and I cant help feel sorry for myself. Im carrying around so much emotional baggage.
Well, due to the teeth pullings, my mouth needed healing and at times it felt inflamed and sore. Im not trying to make excuses (even if it sounds like it) but, because of that I think my mouth was just so sensitive that even when I brushed, it wasnt 'proper'... especially in the eyes of the dentist who stated ""he doesnt want to take responsibility for how bad my teeth hygiene is"" And my mom joking saying I dont have to eat anymore.. So I guess I can starve and die. It makes me feel weak and sick, this anxiety..

Its stupid but I do feel guilt and shame about it, and I am trying my best but my efforts never seem enough. My mouth still is sore and feels inflamed. After the last dental appointment I come home and I cried. Its hard enough to try to reach out when your in pain and asking for help, then to be guilt tripped for it. On the other hand, I know it is this dentist job to be blunt, and to express concern but he doesnt have to say things like ""whats the point if I clean it for you, Then next week its dirty again.."" Im not perfect! I know Im not! hard habits take practice and time.. whether I vigourously brush like crazy just because of what he says? Whats the point? Perhaps I am too emotional about it.. i dont know

Anyways, my anxiety was already on high thinking about all this. And my mom makes it worst, thinking that we should see another dentist before seeing that guy, its like she wants it to be perfectly cleaned for him because of what he said.Those words felt more like he was blaming/guilt tripping me. And this morning my mom says Lets seek another dentist to clean it. Sigh.. I have no courage now to face that dentist because I am scared I am not good enough and it is all my fault.

For reference, we dont have dental insurance and dont have a regular dentist. And its hard finding a nice/good doctor who will help me especially as I am in pain. Its hard in general, with so much health issues I guess.

Thinking about it spikes my anxiousness and dread. Especially when my mom felt like going somewhere else because of what the doctor said, like i have to truly be ashamed and hide.

THEN last minute she tells me I have to go by myself and take the bus to the appointment. And I dont know why but that pushed me over the edge. I ended up cancelling it and paying a cancellation fee. I felt my hands were tied.

In some reasonable world, where I am not emotional, perhaps I could have taken it, say screw it Ill go by myself (even if I dont know how to get there and I know Ill be late) but not today. Perhaps it was the harsh judgements from that doctor that turned me off or my mom persistence of seeing someone else, the money, the pain.. its everything that just pushed me hard. and I couldnt help blame myself. I just sat there crying after cancelling it.

the anxiety monster is blocking me today and I dont know how to get over it. I feel stuck and that I am the one to blame.",loneliness
I am so lonely since I lost my husband....,My husband was my only family after my parents died. We were married for 25 years and during that time I never felt lonely. Then in 2017 he passed away and now I feel all alone with no support. I feel like I have no life--I'm just existing. Every day is the same. I'm in a personal care home (I never should have given up my apt) and I lost my car. all my possessions and my pet cat passed away. So many losses. I'm kicking myself that I didn't even take my beautiful engagement ring with me. I missed my husband's funeral because his brother never called me to tell me when it was. I've never been to my husband's grave site. We used to cuddle together on a regular basis. I miss that so much. I can't remember the last time I got a hug from anyone. I'm not living in my hometown--I can't afford to move back there. This town in 27 years never felt like home. I'm in so much pain and I don't know how to move on.,loneliness

I'll see the gas station attendants on the way out of town and then my podcasts will keep me company. This is not a pity party. This is my reality. I'm used to it.

Nothing Lasts,"I'm stupid.

I have lost all my family through drifting and being in forensic psychiatric care for 8 years due to a diagnosis of psychotic illness and being detained indefinitely through the court and I had to gain freedom to a less secure open rehab (not to be confused for addiction). I am losing hold here and my alienation is strong. I feel like a criminal and parasite, I fell in love only to lose him on a soul level, he is all I've got and I hardly see him and now there's a gam between us non-verbally but it's there. He has committed crimes like me and he has had it tough on top of having Aspergers Syndrome, I am society's trash, on top of the childhood trauma, fostering, legal homelessness, drugs and god knows what. I can't write it all here it would take a book, but basically I was threatened with murder several times in my childhood due to satanic brainwashing. I have no hope. No siblings. Everything is gone. I am not interested in life or death and I will never ever forget my first love no matter how awful I was to him at times we had a connection. I give up. ",loneliness

On Thanksgiving, we would always go to a nice place to eat and have a nice time, and would stay for a few more days. I miss those visits. My husband died in June 2017 and I have no other family. I always looked forward to the holidays and now I just feel empty and lonely because it seems like everyone else has family to get together with and I have no one. Even the members of my church have been giving me the cold shoulder because they're busy preparing meals for their families. Can anyone else relate to my situation of having no other family?

Lonely,I'm in a bit of a situation and could use some advice. I'm not good with expressing how I feel and opening up to people and whenever I do it comes of in a mean or arrogant way. I have depression and anxiety and both seem to get worse when I've had a bad day or something ticked my off. One of my roommates thinks it is best for me to leave but the other two roommates want me to stay because that's what we agreed upon for a year and they want me to get better with communicating and still live in our apartment. I don't know what to do because I've never lived with roommates before so I'm still getting used to that but at the same time I've always secluded myself from people and bottled thing up. I feel more alone when I don't have that easy communication to just go talk to someone face to face and I feel I'll get worse than better if I leave but I also don't want to stay in the apartment I case I don't get better and potentially so or do something that would ruin my friendships with my roommates. The comfort of being able to walk out of my bedroom and have people around me makes me feel less lonely and I want to keep that. I don't know what I should do.,loneliness

pain makes me lonely,"I had my second surgery at the begining of this year. My first was when I was 18, I had cysts removed. And since I have been struggling to fight off the chronic pain. Its a constant uphill battle, and My body seems to be so imbalance. I have good days and bad days, but even with the good days I feel a heavy weight of emotional pain. Currently going to counseling (therapy) yet at times, its hard to see my efforts especially when I am in so much pain all the time. 
I keep getting sinus infections. Awful dental pain and headaches, and dizziness. Not to mention the crippling cramps I get. Its paralyzing at times.
I wish I knew what to do with myself. After the dentist yesterday, I cried and cried. I am so scared of what will happen. Im trying hard to take responsibility for my health, but having all these issues weighs so heavily and I am always so tired. It never feels enough my efforts, and I have the worst anxiety That I am not enough.
I just cant stand myself! whenever I get a flare, I scream 'whats wrong with me'. I keep trying and trying... and its a constant struggle to keep up with everything. I wish I didnt have so much pain and anxiety. 
I suppose I wanted to rant, have a place where someone understand the pain I am going through without judgement.
Sometimes, its hard not to blame yourself, while your body is 'betraying you' for putting yourself through so much, at the same time that blame game is awfully cruel, and Im trying to keep it at bay or else I feel I am going to spiral into depression. Been there and its so hard to climb out, and its so hard to ask for help... because in the end its like your alone.

As soon as people find out I am a widower, I feel like I am a perahia, shunned and avoided like I have (am) plague!

A Life of Misery Seeking Justification,"I am considering ending my wretched life.  I have long ago lost all joy and hope for change.  
For many years, I was a very hostile person, and was unkind to more people than I can recall.  I know there are many who would like to have their say, including lots of people who never even knew my name.  To each of them, I’m sorry for any undeserved pain or insult I might have inflicted.  I don’t need to hear from you.  You cannot hurt me any more than I already hurt myself with unrelenting self-loathing. 
My main concern about self-euthanization is its possible selfishness.  There is no one in my life whose own would be worse for my loss.  I am incapable of forming intimate relations with friends or lovers.  I am utterly alone. 
Before I make my final decision, I need to know if there is anyone whose life I substantially improved.  I need specific examples that I will remember.  The last thing I want is someone telling me I cheered them up with a nice comment to their post, or smiled at them in the check-out line.  I’m talking about really making a difference.  Something only I could have done.

My thoughts of the day,"The high percentage of street crimes in other countries are the results of living in a broken economy. When people can't legally earn a living due to cut backs they result to becoming hardened criminals. People need to eat and pay rent and will find a way to do so even if it result into them having to do evil deeds. The generation of our grandparents was better. The economy was stronger yet consumption of material goods was much lower. People kept their old stuff and took care of their things. Yet they were making money and had money in their savings. People of today earn 1 dollar and end up spending 2 dollars have nice things and are actually poor due to debt.Our society is broken. Filled with divorce, promiscuousness, broken families, drug abuse (because of legalization of weed) and over consumption of material goods. Young people no longer enjoy learning or studying due to social media and sex addiction (constantly on dating apps). We are no longer moving forward in humanity yet technology is constantly changing and being developed. The new first world country is China who is rising in economy and education. The reason is that people study and work hard. They also do all of our manufacturing.",loneliness

Existential isolation vs loneliness,"I was just reading an article on livescience.com and it said there is a difference between loneliness and existential isolation. I hadn’t heard of this before. I’m pretty sure I fall into the second group. What about you?
“Existential isolation is related to loneliness, but it's not the same thing, Helm told Live Science. Loneliness is a feeling of a lack of contact with others, whereas existential isolation is the feeling that other people just fundamentally don't understand you. Socializing while feeling existentially isolated can actually make the problem worse, Helm said.”

7 years of Pop being gone is coming up on me fast,  a recent health crisis sort of pushed it to the back of my mind but looking at the calender today and seeing how close it really is has brought me crashing back to reality just in time for the nightmares and visions to rip my world away from me again. The pain of losing him is still there, the image of him taking my hand as he took his last breath is burned into my brain and starting to flash before me when I close my eyes. 

But I think what hurts the most this year is knowing that the one person who I thought I could count on to be there to always turn to has turned his back on me. Seeing how easily I am forgotten by a man who claims I am his best friend who he's afraid of losing hurts more then I ever thought possible. So I find myself looking at Pops  anniversary date looming over my head back to facing it along.

Literally.  So my bringing it up is pointless.  Been there, done that.  We get along most of the time.  But really, it's like we're two aquaintences living in the same house.  It's lonlier with someone than if I was on my own.  Who else has that?",loneliness
well that's a push back to zero,"A couple weeks ago I met a lovely lady. We agreed to go at her pace since she has some trust issues.  Hell, doesn't everybody have some kind of issues?

I felt like bitch slapping them and saying: ""Fuck no itisn't...""

Back to being alone and lonely.
I was able just recently to change part of my situation. I don't qualify, here in Texas for any kind of medical, which means I can't pursue my SSI, and I desperately need it.  In Houston, which is in Harris County, they have a medical thing for poor people. I already figure I qualify, going by what I have read.  In Houston, instead of this ""uncivilized"" area I live in, I  can meet people, even though broke, I can go places, if I walk there or find a way to ride the bus...hell, I might even meet a woman!!!
My older sister lives in the city, she knows of my problems, she has offered me to move in with her and my other niece. As of today, if things go right, I will move to Houston this Saturday.  One problem is, she has no internet, which means I have to locate a program for low-income internet.  I had it in California, by ATT and I believe they offer it here as a deal made with the FCC when they bought Dish...or when Dish bought them...I dunno.  I found references online for other programs, so maybe it will work out.
But...today it hit me.  I am returned to ""zero"".  It's like one-step forward, pushed two-steps back.  Happy and not lonely for two weeks has made me realize I am starving for a relationship, humans need that sort of thing and I amtired of being emotionally and intimately hungry. 
I got some note from somebody who told me to read the Bible...Jesus saved them.  Yeah? So what?  God is the responsible power who put my wife in her schizophrenia, who then put me into my situation.  I pray, but it certainly has done no good. I have been made fun of, by praying to Saint Jude, the Patron Saint of Improbable Outcomes...Impossible Causes.  A perfect Saint for me, regardless of the fact I am spiritual and not religious, especially a ""Modern Day Christian.""  No, please don't go off on me for what I said, all it will do is make me angry and worsen my mood.  You can believe what you want, I don't care, just leave me alone because there is nothing in it for me.
I'm tired of waiting for a miracle, one which will never come.  So don't start in on me.
Alone again...I was reminded of that this morning when I recieved a turn-down message from my oldest daughter for help.  I have no idea what in hell has happened to her in the recent past. We were very close, now I might as well live on the moon. And I haven't even heard from my ""middle daughter"" either.  Thank Jah, my youngest daughter experienced similar as I did, when it came to my ""wife""...her ""step mother.""  She knew the alter, the one I was married to, for eleven years too.  She is the only one who gives a fuck about me, well, other than my oldest niece who has let me live out here in the ultimate boonies since mid-July.
It is true, I am proof of it, others are too if they admit to it: even with caring, loving family around, a human being can be totally alone and lonesome.
It is my hope this changes for me in Houston.  I mean, look at the past couple of weeks. Even though it ended not the way I'd like for it to have ended...it was proof there are people (specifically women) out there who also are alone, lonely and want somebody too...well, ok, maybe she didn't, she's happy in her present life, with her friends.  Maybe she is the rare one who doesn't need the beautiful experiences of intimacy between people, I dunno.
So...I look at this move to Houston as a positive...and hope it will come out that way...regardless I am back at ""zero"", again alone and lonely.",loneliness

why do girls not want to be my friend?,"hey guys, I hope everyone is doing well...just wanted to get some things off my chest.
first off, has anyone on here ever felt better off without friends/support? I have been trying really hard these past few weeks to connect with people but it has gotten no where. I just want to find some girl friends that wants to do nice normal girl things with like sleepovers, shopping, drinking, going to gym or movies. I've tried connecting with girls in my college classes that started a few weeks ago but it has gotten nowhere. I'm a non problematic girl I have no drama no kids no abuse problems I'm not a bitch, I'm very agreeable and nothing offends me. I just want to find the Paris to my Nicole. In high school 8 years ago I had so many close girl friends and I miss that so much. They all have moved out of state or have kids/married now. 
I don't know why I haven't been able to form a friendship with a girl; it has gotten me very depressed. I get approached by guys often who give me their numbers and what not but I try to not follow through on that because it's almost impossible to just remain friends with a guy at least for me. I feel like I'll never have another girlfriend again ",loneliness
impossible,"This is impossible. This is the hardest time in my life, starting mid-June 2019. Way too much backstory to this whole scenario. I'm not even going to attempt to explain what went on Jan 2019 to that day my ""wife"" got rid of me.  Since then she's sterilized her life of everything we had left, which included the very last of our stuff in storage, to the clothes and other things I was forced to leave behind. She has in her psychological disorder systematically rided her ""world"" of everything her alter, my ""wife"" and I shared, which was proof we had a totally loving relationship for eleven years.  I have not even heard from her since June, I know where I left her, which was at a very emotionally and psychologically unhealthy place for her.  I had been told by two different people, one who suffers DID and one a therapist, a bad or ""unsafe"" environment can often bring back the disorder, even after a silent 14 years.  I never knew she had a disorder and personally, I don't think my wife (the alter) did either.
So since June, I have been forced to return to Texas, my home state. Nothing has changed here in something like 22 years, same damn draconian state with it's idiotic old-west mentality and laws. I exist in a reality of chronic pain: chronic migraines, Cluster Headaches, double scoliosis in my neck and a f'd up spine.  I was on a regimine of an opiate pain killer, Norco, while I lived in Sacrament California, when I got back to Texas, I found I didn't quality for medical insurance, there is none for poor people without children, in Texas: nothing has changed, not even ""ObamaCare"" is here and that so called idiot Trump and his ""TrumpCare"" has just made it worse.
Every morning for months, I wake up in multiple pain, all the way from physical to emotional.  I'm not sure which one is the worse pain.
I have found myself so alone here. I live in a very isolated area in what is called The Big Thicket...a heavily forested, almost primitive geographical area which has seen little development in over a hundred years.  I am totally alone, other than family I live with. I am blessed by them, for sure, otherwise I would still be in Sacramento and homeless, since ""she"" kicked me out.  I am financially destitute, getting ready to fight Social Security again...while she has her disability and has for years...if not for me, pushing her for three years to not give up...I am left destitute because of her psychological disorder and her ""original.""
This lonliness is slowly killing me, like a soul-sucking vampire.  My only outlet is the internet, but recently I have fallen into an emotional victim of online scam artists at certain adult dating sites: the whole site apparently a scammer system.  Hell, I am so lonely, once I figured out what they were, I would play along with their bullshit, just to have ""somebody"" to chat with.  I am pitiful. I am such a freakin' loser.
So here I am totally alone, even with family, chatting with scammers as if I think the women are ""real""...just for company, while my ""wife's"" original is back in Sacramento, who knows what the fuck is going on with her...is she ok, is she still deep in her psychological disorder, is she still doing Meth? Does she still live where it is emotionally dangerous for her? Is her old friend, the landlady, still so fucking ignorant and stupid...and can't see the differences between the her who is the original and the her who is the ""alter?"" Is she now taking advantage of that total ignorance of their's? Is she sad? Is she surviving? 
It is questions like this which I have every day...and it just makes my anxiety and depression worse, every day...and reminds me of how fucking lonely I am...without her in my life.  When I say ""her"", I mean the alter her, the one I was in love with, who loved me and shared eleven years of a wonderful life with.  She will never be the same, even if the original finally gets comfortable enough to slip away and let her alter exist...the psychological disorder, like a computer, will rewrite the program so it will fit the scenario and my sweet wife will never know what really happened.
I hate this. I hate my existence. I feel suicidal a lot now. I'm sixty-three and the happiest moments in my life were from May 2006 to late March 2019...there will be no more happy moments for me again.  My life is dead, I am dead: it's like existing inside a coma, inside a ""Twilight Zone"" episode...for the rest of my life...if lonliness doesn't kill me...soon, well, I don't know what comes next.",loneliness

dear diary,"As a kid, I lived alone in the country without a phone, tv, or companions except the dog and chickens.  You can learn alot from nature but it doesn't speak to you in a human voice.  One day I saw a butterfly unfolding and I ran in to tell Mom to come and look with me.  She was reading and didn't want to stop and come out.  Later, the butterfly was gone.  Couldn't share that experience with anyone.  
I had to share a seat on the school buss with others of course.  Some were friendly but others, made fun of me because the buss moved as I was going up the isle and then I was called ""hippy"" for bumping into someone.  The fat kid...  More isolation.  Art school after high school but it was distance learning by mail.  Dad thought college was for communists.  But I know we could not afford my going so I said I didn't want to go.  Save face, so to speak.
Got my first job at an orchard.  I worked mostly alone.  When others were taking a break, I was busy and no one invited me to join.  Alone again.
Dad got sick and Mom and I stopped everything to take care of him at home.  This lasted for 11 years.  No dates or job at that time.  ( I was able to get one to do at home for little money)  I had met a guy whom I thought could be the father of my kids.  He saw Dad's condition as a deal breaker and he disappeared.  I mourned the loss but didn't know why he left till years later.  He is still single and really fat, I heard.
Moving here was my chance.  I kept trying to get a job but no one would hire me.  I wasn't related to anyone here.  They didn't know me.  Finally I got a job and have worked ever since except for one year.  Along I have taken classes and got an Office Tech certificate and have done several volunteer jobs for no money.  At least I got to know people.  But no one to share my life with.  
Now Mom is sleeping more than awake but she says she is awake most of the night---THAT IS BECAUSE SHE SLEEPS DURING THE DAY!!!  Lucy is sleeping most of the day too.  When I had the boy cat, he was usually awake and would be with me.  Still not over losing them (boy and girl one day apart). 
I thought I had met ""him"" again.  No, he says he will not date-me.   So he is out of luck.  His ego is his too big anyway.  I did have one date in the last 12 years.  I messed that one up.  Just out of a job and home sick.  
I am praying for a real ""him"" to share my life with.  Not going to do all the giving but he has to be there for me too.  Hope is still a glimmer like a candle in the dark.  But my candle is getting shorter.",loneliness

I don't get to really talk to them often and I usually just take care of myself. I live my life these days like a routine from school to home then sleep. It is all I do. I try to interact with other people of course but most of the times I just don't have that connection. I just feel like when people talk to me that they really are not talking to me.

Lonely & Unhappy,"hello everyone!
I am brand new here but am so excited that  I found this site!  I have been married for 51 long years....married very young and have only ever been with this one man my whole life!  We have 4 grown children and 5 grandchildren.  My husband had to retire at a young age due to a workers comp issue.  Since he has retired, he has grown so old!  I am retired but work part time because I don’t know what I would do with myself if I didn’t work.  We have 2 completely different lives.  We live more like brother and sister.  He shops for himself and eats what he wants.  I offer to cook for him at times or offer for him to try what I am eating but he always declines.  We do not do anything together at all.  He will not even go out to eat with me hardly ever!  We have a completely loveless marriage.  I know his manhood may be a big issue for him since he cannot perform any more.  We tried to have sex about 8 years ago but it just didn’t work.  But I could live with that if I knew that he still cares!  There is no cuddling, morning or night kisses...I feel as though he just wants nothing to do with me.  It is really starting to get to me!  Just last weekend, I showered and got dressed and told him that I was going out for the day and all I got was “okay.”  As I was driving to go shopping for the day, I realized that I could be having an affair or meeting someone and he would never know or care! That really hurts!  I don’t know what to do but I feel like something is going to explode!  I made an appointment to see a counselor early November for myself.  I know he would never agree to go!  Any advice??  Desperately hopeless!!!",loneliness

I've been working through a pain in my butt, actually I think it's a psyatic nerve (not sure if that's spelled right) and I bought some different shoes with a bit more cushion. I can't seem to figure out what it is and my chiropractor just told me to do some stretches but I don't think that's helping. last weekend I bought the SNES Classic and am enjoying that. I've been playing a bit of Mario Kart recently. 
Got some good news as I went to Walmart today to get the shoes and some Probiotic (Yes I""m having problems in that area also) and used the blood pressure tester machine and for the first time in a long time my blood pressure was under 130.

Friendless,"I really REALLY wanted to talk with someone about this. 
 I'm now a sophomore in high school. Since I've started, I've realized I'm friendless.
So here is a little story that actually happened this year. 
So, when I was about to begin freshman year, I met this girl online, which would later be my best friend. My friend from middle school introduced us. Since then we've always talked together. Confide our secrets together. This summer, she told me she got a boyfriend. I was REALLY REALLY happy for her. But then I started to notice that we've been texting each other less than usual. I didn't mind. When school started We stopped texting each other. That's when I became friendless. My only friend gone. Now, every time I'm sad, can't really tell anybody. :/ I really miss her. But I hope she is doing well. :)

Real Connections are Hard to come by,"I truly feel that real connections are hard to come by... I constantly find myself feeling pretty numb after hanging out with people. Whether it’s a coworker, a friend, a super close friend, or even a family member sometimes, i can’t help but feel like i can’t get that deep connection i long for after hanging out with them. 
I find that i spend a lot of my time pretending or “faking” when I’m around other people. It drives me nuts sometimes because i really want to show other people who i really am. I really want to make meaningful relationships with people and build on those relationships over a long period of time. But ultimately, i always end up feeling the need to “act” a certain way when around other people. In fact, this feeling is so strong and uncomfortable that i tend to always put on a different act depending on the person I’m with. ",loneliness
School Loner,"I'm in high school and most of the time, I am very lonely. It's like I'm invisible most of the time. In my drawing class, the girl that was sitting next to me didn't even realize I was there until I asked the teacher something. I shouldn't complain about being lonely since I transfered to this school after being bullied at my old school and I would prefer to be alone than be bullied.
I know I should be grateful for being under the radar but I still would like at least one friend so I didn't feel so alone and invisible. ",loneliness
Am I overthinking?,"Recently, I graduated high school and went to college. I thought it would be an amazing time to meet new people, but I've had a hard time making friends. Everyone already seems to have their friends from high school there with them. It's not that I didn't have friends from high school either. My closest friends (some since childhood) all attend the same college, just not mine. They even live together in a nice apartment. I still keep in touch with them through Discord and other social media, but I can't help feel that they have hung out together in person so much that I might as well be kicked out of the friend circle since I feel like I'm on the perimeter. I've brought it up with them, and they kept ensuring me that they still enjoy my company. It doesn't help much. I still feel very lonely, moreso than I've ever had in my life. Am I overthinking it?",loneliness
Feeling like I don't belong anywhere,"I am struggling with loneliness very much. I moved last year to start school and have had a hard time adjusting. Everyone in my program is very kind - I have just found it hard to reach out to people and even when I am invited to things, have turned down some opportunities because of how tired and unwell I have felt (also dealing with depression, social anxiety, and an eating disorder). 
I am hard on myself and feel like after a year, I should be adjusted by now - it seems like everyone else around me is. I feel so out of place here. I have considered quitting my program of study and moving closer to family, yet I don't want to do that because it is my dream to be here studying what I am studying. I also don't know what I would do in terms of schooling/work if I were to leave. I have no backup plan.
I am finding the loneliness unbearable and am not sure what to do to make myself feel better.  Can anyone relate to just feeling out of place/like you don't belong anywhere? How do you all cope with these sorts of feelings?Thanks in advance for any feedback.",loneliness

Why Do I Hurt for Him?,"I've always been a girl who has struggled with... guys. I get hurt way too easily, and I don't know why. Here's some background: I was bullied in grade school, people would call me ugly, say ""they want to kick my ass"", say that I'm gay, stupid, ""not hot"". I hated it, but I learned to ignore it and move on. I had a crush on a boy during that time, but I never talked to him. i just stayed silent. Maybe the bullying plays a role in this? I'm not sure. I don't focus on it that much. But, I have never been the girl guys were crazy for. So maybe when a guy actually did like me, I hung on to that because I felt like I was actually wanted in the world.
So, fast forward to high school, I had my first boyfriend. Broke up for 2 years, I had a not-serious boyfriend for only 4 months in high school. Then, my first boyfriend and I were together for 5 years. I'm not proud to admit I fell for someone else at my part time job. I left my 5 year relationship and pursued someone new. He reciprocated feelings for me, but the biggest problem was that he was moving in a month far away. I made the mistake of letting my feelings get too deep with him knowing he was leaving. I attached too quickly and too deep. He left, and I was heartbroken. I blocked him from social media so I could move on. Then a year later, I randomly decided to add him on Snapchat and Instagram since so much time has passed. Well, I didn't realize my old wounds weren't completely healed...and I saw something on his story on Snapchat I didn't like. A girl. 

Why the fuck do I care? I don't want to, but I do. We never dated, which I think is pathetic of me to feel this way. We were never together. So why do I feel hurt over seeing this girl? I know, I set myself up. I told myself over and over ""you know you may see something that could hurt you"". But, I ignored those thoughts. And here I am wondering why this bothers me so much. I put him on a pedastal and I don't know why. I feel too much and I don't want to anymore. I'm done getting attached. Why does this happen..?",loneliness
exhausted,"Not even sure what to write.....  It has been a long road for me and it just never seems to get better.  I can say being alone sucks and it seems worse when you realize who your true friends and family really are, but what do you do when you realize there is no one there for you? I know people say ""Don't be negative around other people because you will never meet anyone who wants to be with you"".  Ok.. I get it but what do you do when you put on that smile and facade and meet someone and then later they tell you ""I wish you would said what you were going through when we met...you have too much baggage, you seem toxic (and the best one) I never would have gave you my number if I had known what you have been through"".  How does a guy bounce back from that on top of recovering from truama?  Are women today really this way? Don't believe in love, homelife, kids etc????    I don't even know if anyone is gonna read this, at least I got it off my chest.....",loneliness

Uber or the like is still very expensive for me especially since it would be twice a week. Long story short “friends” in the past always turn down my invites to get together.

Hello,"Greetings everyone,
I just joined the group yesterday and wanted to say hello. 
I have been dealing with a lot over past 5 years and my answer was to try and handle it all by myself becasue when I try and share with my friends I sometime feel as though they don't understand or are too wrapped up into wanted to share what's on thier mind that  they try to analyze me based on a part of what I said without even listing to hole statement/conversation. 
I know that I have somewhat found comfort in being myself but now I think I am ready to venture out and do something different and it is really hard to make the first steps to make a change. 
Every weekend I say I am going to do something that I tend to not go anywhere. 
I have been trying to open my heart to my family but sometimes what's really on my mind I am afraid to discuss it because I amm afraid that they won't listen or maybe understand or they may judge me..which make me isolate my self even more.

I ask him what is going on he says he has this big secret that's causing him to recluse and he needs to clear his head and goes away for the weekend. Me being genuinely concerned for his mental health, about a week later I messaged him to see how he was doing and he reads it and ignores me. I feel like i seriously cant catch a break on the dating scene.  I'm sick and tired of being alone.

I dont want to let another human have this effect on me but seriously what is wrong with me that I cant even get a response back, not even a ""thanks for checking on me but I'm not ready yet"" like a grown adult, or hell a human should have the decency to say to another human. I'm tired of the run around of being left. Everyone leaves me, why dont I just leave.",loneliness
Writing thoughts out loud,"I just want to be loved. Maybe that's my flaw. I can't cope with being single, so I endlessly look for love and get let down every single time. If there are 4 things going right in my life... job, financials, car, place to live, i always end up thinking of the one thing i don't have that makes me depressed. i constantatly worried about travel with my past job, because traveling by car, train, plane, makes me unbelievably anxious to where i can't function. Now, i don't have a job, i lost it. so now i have to deal with not having a job and being alone. The anxiety has gone down now that i don't have a job to worry about travel. it's always something. being alone is a pain of its own. anxiety is something that is nearly unbearable to live with. i just don't know what to do anymore. it's like i can't win.",loneliness
Feeling invisible,"Hi all,
I joined DailyStrength ages ago but never joined a group and never posted, or if I did it was years ago.  I was on a volunteer committee of an association with a high responsibility task I loved.  The downside was I didn't perscribe to the intimidation and ""group think"" culture the top tier had. So I didn't fit.  But I did a kick butt job anyway and they know it.  One day out of the blue I received an email saying I was dismissed from my duties.  No explanation.  Period.  Banished fromthe tribe.  I reached out to two people to ask ""why"".  I was not given an answer and told to move on with my life.
That tells me they don't actually HAVE an answer.  No good reason for throwing me under the bus.  But I feel like I have leprosy and no one wants to stand by me that used to be a friend.  As if by association they will look bad.  There are masses of us in this association and I'm alone.  We have a big meeting coming up and I feel afraid I'll be searching for people to sit with at dinner and walking around by myself all the time looking like a ""loser"" because I don't have an entourage like every one else.  I know it's an opportunity to make new freinds and meet new people.  But is that enough not to be included with my home group some of the time?
Advise?  Has anyone been through this?  and don't I deserve an actual answer as to why I was blindsided?
Thanks.

Recognizing Our Attachment Styles,"Do you ever wonder why some relationships succeed while others fail? Contrary to popular belief, it's not solely based on fate, luck, or trial-and-error. A child’s relationship with their caretaker(s) can affect their relationships throughout their entire life. In the 1950s, child psychologist John Bowlby studied the manner in which infants respond when separated from their parents. Through his studies, he was able to establish a link between early infant reactions to separations from caretaker(s) and ability to connect with others. These attachment styles fall into three distinctive categories: secure, anxious, and avoidant. If you are able to identify your attachment styles as well as your partner's it can help you build a sustainable and fulfilling relationship.
Secure
If you have a secure attachment style, you are a warm and loving individual who feels comfortable with intimacy and closeness in a relationship. You are able to effectively communicate your feelings/needs to your partner and properly respond to theirs. You do not play games with other people’s emotions, and approach relationships in a genuine manner. As an infant, you most likely had caretaker(s) who were emotionally and physically available to you. As you grow older, you are able to go out into the world with a secure foundation and can form solid relationships with others. If a relationship is unsuccessful, you do not blame yourself, and have the self-confidence to realize that the relationship probably was not a good fit for you.

Anxious
When you have an anxious attachment style, you often live in a state of fear and uncertainty. Relationships tend to occupy most of your emotional energy and you become consumed with thinking about your relationship. You are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in your partner’s mood and believe that a small thing will ruin your relationship. You have difficulty articulating your feelings and often play games in relationships to sustain your partner’s attention. During your upbringing, chances are your caretakers were inconsistently available to you. If a relationship is unsuccessful, you often blame yourself and take personal responsibility for its failure.
Avoidant
If you have an avoidant attachment style, you are, due to the case study definition, highly independent and self-sufficient. You are often afraid of losing your autonomy in a relationship and have difficulty getting too close to your partner. You often need to keep a physical or emotional barrier between you and your partner. You do not spend much time worrying about your relationship and tend to be physically/emotionally distant throughout the relationship. Chances are that your parents were distant, rigid and unaccommodating to your needs as a child. If a relationship fails, you often attribute it to not being meant to be rather than a personal character deficit.
Do you identify with any of these attachment styles? Therapy can support you in working to repair and build healthy and sustainable relationships.

Hi everyone,Just joined this group today but not new to the site. I have been a recovering drug addict with 18 years of sobriety. Former convicted felon free from the system for 12 years. Married with 2 step. Kids and one of my own. Lifelong fighter of chronic depression. I Recently have fort in legal troubles that created a rift between me and my family but am in therapy and on anti depressants and things are looking up. I will soon go to prison again but I'm not afraid and still have the love and support of my family. I'm really not alone but always feel an emptiness and longing for company. I'm a happy person in general and feel best when giving support and advice to others but struggle with time by myself .  just sharing my story and wishing everyone good fortune and success in your battles whatever they may be,loneliness
Scared to be alone,"For the past couple of years I’ve been going through a rough patch I guess you could say. I’ve been really focused on myself mentally, physically and spiritually. I’m no where near where I want to be, but I’m on the right path at least. 
While dealing with all my demons the friends I thought I had are gone. I’m alone and I have no life literally do the same thing every day. Wake up, work, home, repeat. I’m having a hard time moving out of my comfort zone. Talking to new people and making Friends. I think way too much and care a lot what others think of me. Tonight I went on a whole cleaning spree so I wouldn’t have to be alone with my thoughts. Cleaning gives me this weird sense Of calm and while my house is nice and clean I find myself with nothing else to do, but to analyze everything that has lead to this very point. 
The one thing I keep asking myself is, what the hell is wrong with me? Did I do this to myself? Will I be alone forever? It’s a dark endless road and there is no light.
I apologize for the long rant, but I needed to write this down and get it out. ",loneliness
Connections,I think the one thing i miss more than anything is actually connecting with people. You know those people you always look forward to talking and hearing from. As time goes on it seems those connections are less and less. The people we once connected with disappear and we try with others but they don't feel the same. It's a sad world sometimes...,loneliness
FInding my way,I am new to this group.  Trying to find some people going through the same things that I am.  I have been divorced for a year and a half now.  No children at home.  i am very interested in finding someone to talk to - spend time with that has been through the same process.  I have tried the online dating sites and the answer does not lie with them   You could write a book about all the crazy people on there.  Even contemplating writing a blog about the dates and the interesting things that happen on that.  Anyone who would like to talk I would love to hear from them,loneliness

First Timer.....,"Hi all,
   First time for me. I'm a 61 year old Bi male. After 18 wonderful year with my partner he sadly pasted away in November 2017. To say I loved him and still do is a understatement.  Its funny, when neither partner consented to the split, thats when it really hurts. But now I find myself on my own. Don't get we wrong, I still have both our families and friends and they have been very supportive and without them I would really be in the dumps. No its when I close the door behind me, thats when that feeling of loneliness descends around me.
   I'm sure I'm not the only one in a similar position and I am generally a happy and outgoing person with many interests from gardening and growing my own fruit and vegetables to being involved to the show dog world as a steward. 
   What am I seeking? Well first and foremost to talk with people with similar experiences. Thats where I hope this support group comes in. Even with my friends and family around me, loneliness is still an issue. One that only a person with similar experiences can really understand. 
   So the help and support must and will be mutual.  If you want to have a conversation with a old fuddy duddy like me please respond, otherwise thank you for reading this post.

first post,"I've always been lonely, as a kid I didn't play sports and Im not a girl, so I didn't fit in during primary school, so during lunch and break time for six years, I walked the perimeter of the playground and filtered gravel for white stones so that when people asked what I was doing, I pretended they were crystals and I found them really cool. I still have jars full of them. That was pretty disheartening, especially as I was pretty young, so I internalized the isolation a bit, and being lonely became normal.
Then I went to secondary school, at about age 11 I think, and it was different, I guess. I've grown my popularity but solely because people find me funny. I can't hold a proper conversation, but all day I can make people laugh, and that filled the hole a bit.
Lot of stuff happened following the first two years, developed depression, mild schizophrenia and a bunch of other stuff happened. Dad turned out to be a fat, useless, unemployed, abusive fuck and so there's no safety at home. Unfortunately because my only friends were only as close as my jokes, I never have anyone to speak to. The closest 'friend' lives an hour away, and my parents barely let me out of the house after a breakdown and breaking my hand on a wall. Long story short, big crash, existencial anxiety, started selfharm and drinking, and even now I'm stuck in a thinking cycle of denying myself any sort of help.
Won't go into too much detail, but met a girl. Much worse situation than me, all went well, she was the only thing that made me happy, visiting me once a week at the train station after school. Things went sideways and there was absolutely no closure for me, as the end was over few cryptic texts. Worried for weeks, skinned my legs by scratching myself one night in fear, fell back into deep depression.
I dont think things are going to get better this time. I haven't touched another human being in months. It was better when I had nothing to miss, god. I hate not being able to have any relation to anybody stable enough to talk to. I tried friends, family, counsellers. Nobody fucking cares, I don't expect them to. I stopped taking my meds for a bit recently, I needed to get away from the suffocating insomnia and relentless lethargy to breathe. I've seen terrible things before, it was worse when I used to browse bestgore and I heard and felt things that still terrify me and make me want to strip myself of flesh to leave it. But worse than the gore nightmares, the women's cries at 2 AM, the worst hallucination was feeling alright for a bit. I woke up with her in the corner of my room like when she used to come over, and she was sitting with her legs crossed and smiled at me. That's the most soul-crushing thing about any of it. Came back from the bathroom and remembered she's been in a psych ward for the last 3 months.
I guess thats the worst thing, remembering how she smiles and her beautiful tired blue eyes and how they lit up when she laughed. 
It's been a while since it ended, too. I just want somebody to hold me again. I just want to be loved

Question,"Hey, very new to this website just because I wanted somewhere to ask questions anonymously. I am a 16 year old high schooler, and I am recently feeling very lonely for the first time in I think my life. I have had a girlfriend for about three years (anniversary was two days ago!) and I haven't really had anyone else but her to hang out with or talk two in a very long time. She's my best friend, and I see and hang out with her for hours every day, and I've been doing so the past three years. My girlfriend has lived with her grandparents for her whole life, and there are a lot of family troubles that she is going through, so recently she decided to move in with her mom which is about a 3 hour drive away. I'm very very happy for her, and I think this was absolutely the best decision she could have made, but at the same time, I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I took very challenging classes in school this whole year, so most of my time has been spent on school, and all my free time has been with her. Considering school just got out, and I can rarely see her anymore, I am at a complete loss. Don't get me wrong, she is still my best friend and the person I'm closest too, but not being able to see her is person is really affecting me. I've tried doing all of my personal hobbies I usually enjoy, like videogames or reading or learning new thing, but none of them have been enjoyable to me. I'm feeling very lonely and sad, and this is the first time I've really dealt with anything like this, so I was wondering what I should do? Are there any hobbies I could get into, or ways I could make the best out of my situation? Thanks so much to anyone who replies, it means a lot. ",loneliness
feeling better,I am no longer so lonely. My sister moved back home with me and my parents. So I spend the evening watching tv with her and cookking her supper for her. During the day I have my mom with me but she usually spends the day sleeping and then goes to work in the afternoon. I think that I would be in a happy place if I could find myself a girlfriend and maybe go back to school or get a job so that im not home all day. I am just not so sure if I am capable yet.,loneliness
You Can Do This!,"Since this is the Lonliness one, and I know we all hate feeling lonely, I just want to explain something. I don't know if other people also feel this way, but sometimes I feel lonely, even when I'm in a group of my friends. While this can be very depressing or saddening to me, I can find things that make me happy again. You are not alone. Find friends who care about you and will be with you through anything you go through. My issue was telling one of my friends about my anxiety who wasn't ready. Make sure you have friends who you are also comfortable telling stuff to. If you feel like you need a friend, this website seems like a great way to find online ones. Also, people, I've found, are generally nice, at least at my school if you ask to sit with them at lunch. Being a shy person like me, this is sometimes hard, but you can do this.
Have a great day!",loneliness

"Hi, I cant human anymore","Hi, so after trauma I am struggling to human.I dont understand my feelings, I cant work out certain interactions with others, I need help processing things.... to ensure that what I am feeling is either right, or to get a better perspective of things.I know everyone says ""trust your gut"" but when you are ALWAYS being told to look at the other persons feelings or how they said it etc then I dont know how to trust myself.So, todays ""I need help processing"" is I have a friend, who I thought was close, just have a baby. She is withholding information on the health of baby whos just had a lumbar puncture (2days old), so things must be pretty serious.... I am concerned, for both the baby AND for my friend who has mental health issues including bipolar. This friend was my birth partner (I am solo mum by choice but needed someone so chose her),she has been my rock through the trauma (my dd disclosed SA by her father)  and subsequent court battle and she has been my friend for a long time.I dont think I am her ""best friend"" .... How do I ask her, compassionately, how she is, how the baby is, when I only get one word answers.... How do I support her or at least let her know I am here if / when she needs....I guess for me, I am a sharer... everyone pretty much knows my stuff... thats how I process, and I understand people are different, BUT, why send a message saying ""we are going to be in hospital longer and dont want visitors"" and ""baby had a lumbar puncture"" with no supporting information...Is this just a fishing for attention expedition?  I feel discarded...  or (all my life im told) should I stop thinking about myself and think about HER feelings more.......

Don't Know How To Do This,"I'm 38, male.
I was bullied over my disability at work (PTSD) to the point where I couldn't go there anymore. 4 days after that, my girlfriend who I was with for over 5 years breaks up with me. A week later she tells me she wants me out, and wants to have no contact with me.
Now I had to move back to my highly toxic grandma's basement, at 38 years old. 
During the course of my relationship I lost what little family and friends I had, none of them were ever good people or supportive in any way to begin with. The problem is that, I don't know how to meet people or make friends at my age.
I am so scared, and depressed. My whole life was flipped upside down in a couple weeks time, and the adjustment was just too much to handle.
I realized today when doing paperwork for my job that I don't even have an emergency contact. How bad is that? Not a single person to call if something bad happens. 
Any advice, or words of encouragement would really help. Thank you.

Social Recluse,"Hi everyone,
I have never been good at making friends in person. It always makes me feel like I have to strain myself to look for things that others would like to talk about, or when in large groups remain silent, as everyone else tends to talk over me. Some times it just feels easier to let everyone else do all of the talking, and I just sit quietly. I recently moved my family from the west coast to the midwest, in which we have absolutely no family or friends, outside of our neighbors we talk with. My wife wants me to hang out with my coworkers, but I have a hard time doing that disconnect of work and personal life, as eventually one ends up spilling into the other. I have never really felt included in most conversations as well, so it also ends up making it a bit difficult in making new friends.",loneliness

I've never belonged and I fear I never will,"My whole life I struggled to have friends. I used to get stomachaches and social anxiety when trying to socialize.

And I only have 1 friend, but we've grown apart because she lives very far and has a family now.
I want to be happy and belong somewhere. But I'm so scared to put myself out there again. Another attempt to make friends, as if it's my lifelong purpose that I never actually fulfill. 
Last year I was so lonely I had sex with a guy just because he was nice to me and asked. It's been 6 months and he's still the only person I ever spend time with. We don't even like each other, we just use each other for different reasons. I hate it and cry a lot because I know it's pathetic to sleep with someone just to avaoid being alone. But if I don't spend time with him occasionally, I letterally have no human contact outside of grocery store clerk and my doctor.

Friends are hard to come by...,"I moved away from home about 3 years ago to play collegiate soccer, it was the greatest experience I have ever had! I made so many friends, I met my best friend for life but once I graduated I transfered to a different school still 1200 miles away from home and 5 hours away from my last school, I have been super lonely. I didn't realize how hard it is to make friends when you aren't apart of a team or club. At first I joined a club team at the school, but still didn't make any friends, I tried to invite my anatomy group bowling but they never replied. I have tried to make friends but I am just so shy. I have been at this new school for 6 months now and I noticed that outside of work, I can go days, even weeks without having a face to face conversation. Even in a group of people I still feel all alone. Its hard to get ahold of my family because we are in different time zones and I work until midnight. My best friend works nightshift so I don't really hear from her much. On top of all of this, I have been getting really bad anxiety attacks and all of this togeteher has really affected me emotionally and mentally. Thank you for reading.   ",loneliness

Wasting Time,"Lately I often feel like I am wasting time and wasting my life. I often think about if it would be possible to achieve anything, or what I really want.
I often am surrounded by people but I don't fit in with anyone. I don't understand them or their lives as anything other than a problem that needs to be solved, and fixed if possible.
I'm fairly outgoing and friendly but idk how to make friends. Especially being in a relationship I feel like I have to focus all time and attention on him and what he wants to do. But we don't have a lot in common and I don't enjoy doing activities with other people. Other than talking or eating together. I hate sports, they are so boring. He wants me to go do things in the city, and go to concerts. I feel sick with dread to do those things. I feel even more lonely when surrounded by people or in a crowded city. Like I have no voice and barely exist.
I try to keep myself occupied when I'm not at work, but I don't have enough money to do much, or the people I live with always want money and things.
When I was single I was miserable, but I'm not happy now either because I'm chained to one person. Well 2 since I am also chained to my mom.
Everyone acts like it is so easy to just be single and live on your own. It's not at all. Everything costs money and time.
Maybe the reason I feel like such a waste is because other people take so much of my time. I have so many projects and activities I want to do. Such as get more education, finish writing my cookbook, cook more, garden more, get a gym membership and go often. But idk when I have time to do those things because I am allowed no independence. I sit and waste my time all day at work never learning anything new, then I get home and mom barks orders. I have to start dinner or if I avoid cooking I have other chores to do. If I try to work out at home he complains that he just wants to relax and watch TV. We have a small house so I guess it bothers him. He wants me to sit beside him and be bored watching TV or watch him play vid games! Uggh that's the worst. Meanwhile my mind is ticking off all the things I need to be doing.
I feel much more lonely now. Maybe it's because I dread everything. Idk why but when I had more time to myself I felt more hopeful and less lonely. Now I just feel old and tired like I never had any youth it just got taken away a long time ago.",loneliness

They have told me that it is not because I’m not pretty enough or smart enough or entertaining enough and it is not to do with my personality and they don’t know what it is about me. I’m very worried that I will never figure out what is wrong with me and that I am just completely unlovable. I have been worrying recently that I will end up unmarried, alone and unloved forever. These thoughts have been taking their toll on me and I have been struggling with my will to live as a life of loneliness is not one I would want to live. 

My friends tell me not to worry about it because I'm only 19, I’m young and I have time but that is easier said than done.

I do feel paranoid, about the surgical pain, and being outside. It takes so long to heal. And I dont want to be stuck with my thoughts as I do struggle anxiety
has anyone else out there, experienced something like this? Having to rest, stay home for medical reasons. What did you do to distract yourself? I need a cure for boredom, Maybe I am just restless 
I wish I felt confident to start taking walks again... I love taking walks, though since the surgery I feel Ive lost some confidence, always having to be ""careful"" and catious. Sigh. 
I dont know what to think anymore, Im quite relient on what the doctor may say about my condition, though Im not seeing my doctor until march 11, so I feel stuck, just at home idling. ",loneliness

Distraught over social justice discourse,"Hey, there. I really could use some support. I feel so alone, as I feel rejected by both ""SJWs"" and ""anti-SJWs"". Now, I know the term ""SJW"" is generally used as a pejorative - but I'm using the term for the sake of simplicity. You see, I started getting involved in feminism and social justice back in 2011. Then I had joined Tumblr in January of 2012. For the first few years, I was very active in social justice - until I was, essentially, ex-communicated bu December of 2015.Please pardon the length, but I need someone to hear me out and understand where I'm coming from.~~~~~1. I first started getting interested in feminism at some point in 2011 - and, via the concept of intersectionality, I’ve gotten into social justice in general. I’ve also taken up causes for fat acceptance and neurodiversity acceptance. I still support the basic tenets of all three causes.2. One thing I should clarify on the “fat acceptance” one is that I do *not* make any claims over fat being healthy or weight being unimportant. I simply believe that people should not be bullied, harassed, or taunted on the basis on their weight. Nothing more, nothing less.3. One common thread between feminism, fat acceptance, and neurodiversity acceptance is the belief that people should not be condemned or punished for certain behaviours that harm nobody else. In other words, it jibes quite well with my believe on the “harm principle” and being anti-authoritarian.4. So then, when the issue of “cultural appropriation” came up, that did *not* jibe with my anti-authoritarian views. I kept quiet about it for a long time, though. That maybe should’ve clued me in that I was starting to get involved in a toxic community, particularly that I felt I had to keep quiet about my own views on that issue. However, I did not see any suitable alternative for me. The anti-SJWs sure the hell didn’t appear to be a good alternative - considering that they had already seen to taunt me on a few occasions, at that point in time.5. At some point, I’ve started to see more and more cases of people being bullied or harassed in the name of “social justice”. I’ve seen instances such as as when white people with dreadlocks or white people wearing kimonos would get harassed in the name of “social justice”. Or when others taunt white people for their perceived dietary preferences, and use “social justice” as their pretext for doing so. So, yes, I have many issues with “SJWs”. Or “toxic activists”, they should be called. If anyone who were themselves part of the social justice community called out such behaviours, I haven’t seen it. Some have actually defended such behaviours - while others have kept quiet about it, perhaps for the same reasons as I did. I, for one, feared retribution from the toxic aspects of the social justice community.6. Per #5, it didn’t exactly help when it seemed as if the only people who were willing to call out abuses in the name of “social justice” were from anti-SJWs - many of who seemed to be just as likely to be in the “SJWs are crybabies” or “SJWs are idiots” camps, as in the “SJWs are bullies” camp. So I wasn’t exactly presented with a good alternative, and I greatly feared being associated with the “SJWs are crybabies” and/or “SJWs are idiots” camps simply for daring to speak out against abusive behaviour done in the name of “social justice”.7. So that it distresses me greatly that seem to be very few SJW critics who are *exclusively* in the “SJWs are bullies” camp, while vocally rejecting the “SJWs are crybabies” and “SJWs are idiots” camps. I seem to be the only one doing that, and it is hard for me for find like-minded folks. That is the source of my frustration.8. So, on that note, whenever an anti-SJW criticizes abusive behaviour that is done in the name of “social justice” - how can I be certain that said anti-SJW falls *only* in the “SJWs are bullies” camp, while having no use for the “SJWs are crybabies” or “SJWs are idiots” camps? That is my problem here.9. So the problem I have with anti-SJWs is that so many think I’m being overly-sensitive about being female, physically disabled, and neurodivergent - in the same exact way that SJWs think that I’m being overly-sensitive about being white. So the problem I have is with finding a community who will accept me for being female, physically disabled, neurodivergent, *and* white. Do, as such, I feel rejected by both SJWs and anti-SJWs.~~~~~Why don’t more people criticize SJWs *only* for being bullies?Why don’t more people criticize SJWs strictly for issues such as the following? Harassing white people for “cultural appropriation”. Feeling the need to ruthlessly taunt white people. Being dismissive of the issues and feelings of white people. Harassing fan artists such as zamii007 for “problematic” fan art. Downplaying the atrocity of the four black people kidnapping and torturing a disabled white man for days in Chicago. Thinking it’s appropriate behaviour for grown ass adults to spew hatred on *kids* such as Keaton Jones.In summation, I really wish more people would criticize SJWs *only* for issues such as these. Cases where SJWs revel in hurting other people.Do you realize that you dilute the whole cause when you feel the need to throw in BULLSHIT criticisms about SJWs being “crybabies” or “idiots”?!When you feel the need to ruthlessly taunt SJWs for things such as “safe spaces” or “trigger warnings”, then you are being EVERY BIT AS NASTY AND REPULSIVE as the SJWs who feel the need to ruthlessly taunt white people!!I *WISH* SJWs WERE CRYBABIES INSTEAD OF BULLIES!!~~~~~TL;DR: As I'm at odds with both ""SJWs"" and ""anti-SJWs"", I feel as if I really have no place to turn - except for this forum, hopefully. So that's that. Thanks for letting me rant.",loneliness
Misunderstandings,"Lately things have been tough. Do you ever feel like you're in a landslide trying to fight your corner? Trying to get people to understand something you shouldn't have to explain in the first place? Loneliness for me is just that. Wherever I go it seems like I'm living in the Pink Floyd song 'Keep Talking' (if you haven't heard of it it's basically about being emotionally/verbally mute) - I haven't got family or friends to offload to and I am currently unable to talk to others around me or even begin to explain why I can't explain... I don't want to be a victim of life and I am a tryer; I'll keep going no matter what, and yes I have some days better than others but here's a thing... I'm 28, and as you get older does it increasingly feel like life is one big gamble, and it's like getting lost in New York city when you've only lived in the countryside, and people are duplicitious and sneaky, and everyone goes around bragging that this isn't this case or wipe it over saying it's all paranoia? It's frustrating because it feels dangerous to be myself. Hence the loneliness... Can you relate? Thanks x",loneliness
Feeling alone this Valentine's Day,"I know I am still young and I will find someone eventually, but when I see all these couples in my school, I can't help but wish that I had that too. I sometimes feel so jealous of the students that I see in the halls that are holding hands and stuff because I want that too.
I know it's stupid to feel this way, but I am so scared that I'll have nobody in my life and that I will be alone. It scares me to death. Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get this off my mind a little bit.",loneliness
Another Lonely Holiday,"I've always had problems feeling close to people for a variety of reasons (lots of trauma and mental health problems). The idea of friends and family is very important to me. However, I feel more alone than ever. I recently cut off most contact with my whole family, since the toxicity was otherwise inescapable. I don't regret it, it was definitely the right choice, but I'm mourning the loss of the idea. I only have about...5...maybe 6? people I would call friends but I'm not really close to any of them, and the two I'm better friends with have moved away. I was pretty close to someone a couple years ago, but he was pretty toxic and I had to get away. I want to feel connected to people, but I'm too....different I guess. I've never felt truly understood and there have been incidents that have led to me losing a lot of trust, even in my friends. The place I used to volunteer at, and the only place full of like-minded people I could hang out with, closed down last year, and I haven't found anywhere else to go. Every holiday, including my birthday, this last year, I have spent mostly alone.
My therapist and I think that this loneliness and grieving has triggered a lot of problems, because I'm kind of riding the line to getting really bad again. I've tried looking online for people, but it's not the same. And there's nothing around my town that fits me (I live in a tourist/retirement town that has nothing for youth and poor people). Everything I'm even remotely interested in (like the one freaking support group) is overrun by much older people and I literally cannot feel comfortable around them. 
I guess I'm just looking for advice. What can a poor, mentally ill, young adult do to combat loneliness?",loneliness
Feeling like I should die...,"When it comes to me sharing my feelings, it's usually an all or nothing kind of thing. Either you get me spewing words at you or you won't hear from me for months. I guess I need to learn how to manage that, but that's beside the point, kind of. One of my friends pointed out to me that it was mentally and emotionally draining on her to have me spouting my feelings to her so much recently. Like, I'm sorry, is that not what friends are for, in part? It felt like a lance across my heart to see this big long text from her basically telling me to fuck off for awhile while she recouperates. It made me want to curl up in a ball, swallow my tongue so I wouldn't say anymore stupid shit, and die. I really wanted to cry, I was so upset (I didn't because I was with my mom when she texted me). I don't have many friends (I have 3, to be precise), so I really don't want to lose her. But I also don't want our friendship to be ""surface level"", so to speak, because I have a few friends like that that I don't even count as my friends for that reason. But if I can't talk to her about my feelings, then I don't have anyone. She's like my safe space. I don't have anyone else I can talk about my feelings with other than her. Before she and I started becoming better friends, I barely texted anyone. I text with her nearly every day now. I don't want to always just be talking about ""oh how was your day?"" ""Fine, how was yours?"" ""Fine."" ""Good."" I don't want that with her. I want to be able to talk about what's upsetting me, why I'm super happy, why I'm on the verge of tears. That's what I want to keep with her. That's been more or less the status quo with us. And I hate, HATE changes to the status quo, unless I'm the one changing it. It feels like an attack on me, almost, when someone wants to change the status quo, at least in terms of communication. Like, I'm sorry if you don't like the way we've been communicating for like 6 months now. If you wanted to change something, tell me sooner, not after the status quo gets established. If I do something you don't like, or want me to change, fine. I'm open to change. I'm a reasonable (semi-reasonable) adult. But tell me as soon as it upsets you. Don't wait like 2, 3, 4 months to tell me. I need to understand what went wrong, where the communication broke down. I have a really hard, if not impossible, time understanding what went wrong if we've been communicating fine for a long time, but you've been stewing on something and finally decide to tell me after we get to the straw that breaks the camel's back. Then I start to think ""but everything was going fine, I've been doing and saying the same types of things for so long, but now you've decided it was too much?"" I'm sorry, you don't get to decide that after so long. If you were reaching a breaking point, fucking tell me before we go over the cliff. Don't go around letting me think what I've been doing is ok, because I'll keep doing it. You don't get to tell me, ""you've pushed me over the edge now, go away."" That's not how this works. Because then I start thinking like I am now, that it would be better to just cut my tongue out so I can avoid this situation ever coming up again. I know a lot of what I've said isn't reasonable to ask of someone. Sometimes you don't know where the edge is until you've gone over it. I just wish I knew where the boundaries were before I went beyond them. I don't like upsetting people, especially my friends. But right now I just feel so terrible. If I never talk, I won't upset people. If I don't upset people, that means they'll still be my friend. And if I have friends, that means I'm, in some small way, succeeding in life",loneliness
Killing me,The loneliness is slowly eating away at my soul. Why is it so hard?,loneliness
Asperger’s Syndrome: Frustrated ,"I was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder when I was a toddler. Due to my diagnosis, I went to a special education school in Puerto Rico. However, I didn’t receive the academic support that I needed in order to succeed in school so my grandmother decided to take me to Minnesota and live with her so I could receive better special education services. During the years that I lived in Minnesota, my academic challenges were making progress but in 2004, my mother got promoted to work in Charlotte, North Carolina and she wanted me to go back and live with her so my grandmother and I moved in with her, my stepfather, and my sister. However, things didn’t go the way I expected because my grandmother had problems relating with my stepfather, struggled to find a job, and overall didn’t like North Carolina so she moved back to Minnesota while I stayed with my mother. When I was in school in North Carolina, my academic performance began to suffer because I wasn’t receiving the support that I needed in order to be successful in school because although I had an IEP, I didn’t have any teachers that took the time to help me overcome these barriers so I switched schools in the middle of my 7th grade year and was in a self contained special education class at the other school that I changed into. Even though, I was in a special education classroom for all of my classes, it wasn’t enough to help me feel prepared for high school so when I got into high school, I was still transferred to a special education classroom and received IEP services but the teacher who was in charge of the special education curriculum thought that I could move back into the mainstream classrooms but my performance in school began to decline and I still faced the same problems I was previously facing which got worse because due to being at the high school level, the classes were more difficult in which the assignments required greater critical thinking and paper writing. Although my mother has always been aware of my academic difficulties, she would get very upset when my grades were poor and she never did anything to invest in my education whether it would involve changing schools because she thought that I had to face my academic challenges with little to no help which made my performance worse and made me feel very unprepared for college. After I graduated from high school, I moved back in with my grandmother because my family didn't understand my Aspergers  
which caused me not to have a positive relationship with them and I didn't like North Carolina. Also, my mother was very strict when it came to my grooming, was unaware of getting some of my needs met as a teenager, and unhelpful with teaching me the skills that would help me learn how to be a responsible adult. I feel that the struggles I faced during high school made me believe that I would never be able to have a career and because I wouldn’t have a career, I wouldn’t be able to live on my own since in order to do that I’d have to be emotionally and financially prepared so when I graduated from high school, I went to cosmetology school because I didn’t want to waste my time being at home all day long doing nothing, I didn’t know that about other options like volunteering that I could take until I felt confident enough to decide what I would be good at doing, and I thought that it was the easiest route to take at that moment since it didn’t require the academic skills in which I struggled with but my grandmother didn’t think that cosmetology was a good fit for me due to the possibility of facing disrespectful clients. However, when I was in cosmetology school, things didn’t go the way I expected because of my self-esteem issues, my grandmother's overprotection and negativity, and the lack of preparation that the school gave me in order to succeed in a career in cosmetology. Because neither my grandmother nor I could understand what was really going wrong, she tried to talk to the school director but nothing was ever made to help me be successful which caused me to lack motivation and get further behind in the program so I finished mediocrely but got my cosmetology license. After I graduated from beauty school, I never worked in the cosmetology industry because I still suffered from a lot of insecurities and I never got any opportunities to improve on my skills in order to continue in that career path. Since I didn’t have any opportunities in the beauty industry, my grandmother suggested that I go back to school and explore other careers that I might be interested in so I decided to go back to school and found several careers that I was strongly interested in but I still faced the same academic challenges I previously faced in high school which caused me to feel doubtful and fearful as each new semester started. Because of my insecurities, I fell into a cycle of starting and withdrawing from my classes at the middle of each semester which caused me to be on academic probation and suspension. Throughout college, I’ve had to appeal three times and I got my autism evaluations sent to the disability services office but the only accommodation I received was extra time on exams and I talked with the disability services director, one of the admissions staff, and the academic counselor but I didn’t get anything from them which made me feel very helpless because I wanted to have a college career but I couldn’t get it if I didn’t get the help and support that I needed in order to do so and due to my frustration, my grandmother suggested that I look for other options besides college so I decided to quit college but at the same time, I have had a lot of mixed emotions because I don’t know about other jobs that I can take that I would be interested in that doesn’t require a college degree. In the present, I feel very confused and worried at times because I know that sooner or later I will have to get a job and I don’t have any other support that I can count on.

Another frustration of mine is that I haven't found therapists who know how to work with adults with Aspergers Syndrome which infuriates me and makes me feel hopeless and question if I'll ever get the help that I need because I feel like there are deep rooted issues that are causing me to feel negative all the time but I can’t figure out exactly what it is that drove me all throughout adulthood to make me feel this way.

In need of some supportive/inspirational words,"People have been asking me: so how do you feel about surgery?
my normal response is: ok, alright...

Sad and lonely,"The divorce was final on Halloween.  It wasn’t something I wanted.  I moved out and into my own house before Christmas. It was so hard moving, going to work, taking care of my kids and trying to put on a brave face during the holiday rush. 
It didn’t hit me until we started the custody schedule. I hate being away from my kids. 
I’ve tried focus more on self care since I know I didn’t take care of myself the last year.  Rejoined my gym, started going  back to my yoga classes and be more social. 
I recently got sick and had surgery last Friday.  Now I’m recovering and I’m feeling sad, lonely and frustrated.  
My family and life long friends are in another state. My former in-laws have all turned their backs on me.  I’ve realized who were my friends and who were friendly with me because of my ex-husband. 
I was married for 17 years but we were together for 22.  I’m feeling so lost.

Life is seriously cruel,"I wonder why some people are destined to suffer a life of lonlyness. I'm older than my profile says and have always wanted a few people to really fit in and connect with. I had friends for a time after I left high school but I got married when I was 23 after knowing the women for a month. Yes I now know how totally stupid that was. She hated me and anyone who would talk to me. Divorced her decades ago but never recovered a social life. I want so bad to connect with just a few friends like the kind most everyone else, that you trust your secrets too. I seriously love women and actually feel more comfortable with them. I only want one to love to the core but never could find one all these years. I'm glad I'm in the last quarter of Life, this is torture as I don't know how to wiggle into the church family I currently attend. If I ever lose my commitments there I will stay far from church. Rejection is serious injury.

Accepting Loneliness,"Why is it that when it gets dark and cold outside that slippery feeling seeps into my bones and reminds me of how alone I am? Sometimes it's just the way the streetlights hit the pavement on my drive home, the way the headlights of all the other cars bounce off of me like I'm just a reflection. It makes me feel heavier somehow, like I'm moving through quick sand. I know that I am strong. I tell myself that I am brave, and I know that I am, but it is hard to be brave and strong as I learn to accept that I don't really belong anywhere. I don't say that because I'm looking for pity or for someone to refute it, I say it because its the truth and the truth is the scariest thing. I don't belong anywhere, I don't belong to anyone, I am alone, and I don't know how to let that settle. In the morning when the sun rises and the air is crisp and my coffee is brewing the aloneness might not feel so lonely, but I know its just a matter of time before the dark and the cold come back, and here I'll be again. So how does one accept the loneliness and sit with it? How does one, knowing that their faults prevent the filling of the emptiness, make a life out of that? ",loneliness
I’m So Lonely,"I’m so, so lonely. I have a wonderful family, but they have friends and can’t be around me all the time, you know? I have a few friends, but they’ve all grown apart from me and found new friends, especially since they all went to college and I’ve been spending this year at home, trying to get a handle on my depression. I’m also an introverted person, and I let that plus my anxiety in social situations get in the way of meeting new people. I’m so lonely and just crave human connection that’s not shallow or fake or only over text, you know? Humans probably aren’t meant to feel lonely for long periods of time. I just want to be spending time in the same room as at least one other person who isn’t required to be with me (aka family haha). I also need to figure out how to treat myself with respect before I can treat others with respect because I’m really struggling with self worth. But I feel like that’s going to take ages, and I don’t want to wait that long to be with someone. I don’t know if anyone else has felt similarly?

Alone.

My phone never rings unless its work related while at work.  I mean all the people I had ever kept up with are non existent anymore.  I am even considering getting rid of the social media 'book'.  I feel it is just a way for nosey people to see what you're up to and stalk your profile.  I don't even care about it anymore.  Most of the people on there don't even talk to me in real life, even family.  
Currently, I am having severe stress and anxiety issues, even my chest gets tight and shortness of breath.   My job doesn't feel too promising anymore, the apartment complex i live in is a zoo and management does NOTHING!  The police have been involved to take care of people disturbing the peace.  Stress has taken its toll on me.  I've lost 10+ pounds due to insufficient sleep because of noisy neighbors.  I go the whole workday feeling sluggish and sleepy.  I have applied at another apartment in a small town and tomorrow I should hear from them if my application was accepted.  In the meantime, I feel so alone.  My mother is the only one to talk to and I don't like letting her now how lonely and extremely stressful I feel.  It would worry her to death.  I have convinced myself that this is the way it is going to be for me.  I guess I'm just here to vent.  ",loneliness
Discrimination,"I thought that since this is a group for lonliness, and lonliness is often due to isolation, and people are often isolated because they are being discriminated against, that maybe it would be appropriate to post here about discrimination.
Does anyone else here feel their lonliness is exacerbated by discrimination from their peers?
This time of year, once again, I feel religious discrimination. Despite the fact I have made an effort to get into Christmas spirit and decorate, I still have had people at work and even my own fiance get huffy with me for saying happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, and even worse for talking about Hannukah and telling people happy Hanukkah!
You know what? Happy mother effing Hannukah anyway! Today is the last day of it and we are supposed to celebrate religious freedom today. Not Christmas vs. Hanukah. Idk why we can't just be nice and celebrate all the warm fuzzy December holidays together, including my birthday!
Another discrimination thing that is happening to me, and gets worse this time of year, is age discrimination. Old people get forgotten about when they should be spoiled for remembering to get all their bratty kids and grandkids presents all these years. You would think then, that people my age wouldn't be discriminated against but we are.
I just turned 28 last week and I am the youngest person at my job. I am not married and there are no children in my family to buy for. Somehow that means I am not allowed to join in conversation when one of the moms I work with asks an opinion of a gift to get their husband or kids. There is a lady here who is 70 and could be my grandma and they exclude her too and she is a widow! Some of the women I work with are so petty. One girl today literally ask a question about what kind of beard trimmer to get her husband for Christmas then said only women with husbands answer. I was about to tell her they had really nice trimmers at this one sporting goods store on sale for $11. Her loss.
I try to ignore it but these women are so miserable and complain all the time about idiotic things. If the 3 of us who don't do that try to have a normal conversation they drown us out or make fun of us. I think it is pretty obvious they hate their lives and are jealous, but they should get in trouble for making comments that I'm somehow less intelligent than them because I don't have kids. My older coworker even got everyone an ornament and they didn't even say thank you. The Holidays really do bring out the worst in some people. Those of us who don't have big families to spend the holidays with don't deserve to be bullied by child bearing women because we ""just don't get it."" I find that statement to be backwards. It is they who don't get the loss of a loved one. But we have to just deal with not having a dad, husbands, kids, a niece, while it is rubbed in our faces by these entitled women who don't even appreciate their families. They complain every day how much they hate their husbands and how horrible their kids are then try to justify that behavior by saying that is just how moms are. No it isn't. I have plenty of friends who are moms and they love their children, never complain, they brag on them all the time. And they sure as hell don't shun me for asking a question or replying to a question.
Sorry for ranting but people being rude and selfish really gets my dander up and I feel like it makes lonely people much more lonely. We don't need to be made even more alone than we already are. People should reach out during the holidays and forget their worse and differences. But I seem to feel my troubles more this time of year. Does anyone else?

Lonely,"I don't know why but for some reason I just feel very much alone snd isolated from the world, or the world has isolated me is more like it.  Not a great feeling.  Wishing it would go away",loneliness
Since I decided to move on...,"I feel more alone than ever.  My whole life I have been waiting for something good to happen.  I have good days but mostly in the past.  Don't go out anymore due to Mom's issues so don't see many like I did.  Used to go to bingo or out to dinner with friends.  Not any more.  I jokingly said I gave up ""passion"" for lent but never did go back to it.  
Lately I came to realize the man I desire, doesn't give a flying fig about me.   He said he would probably forget me in 6 months if we didn't see each other like we do now and he didn't notice my weight loss.  So now I feel more alone than ever. I don't see potential like I used to.  I feel like I am just putting in time.  
Wish I knew how to get out of this mental emptiness.  I do have a plan when I am living alone one day.  But I don't want that really.  I want a man who will love and care for Mom and me.  Wether it is sexual for me or just a companion.  I just want someone so I don't feel so alone.
I have moved on before.  There usually comes a man into view but it takes years in between.  Guess I am impatient as I get older.  I hope I am being prepaired for the love of my life.  Maybe he isn't ready yet?  I pray we will meet soon.  ",loneliness
I have no friends,"I know that I am at an age where I should be dating, but I never have dated in my entire life. I also have no friends. I have one friend who I see once a week. But all he does is play video games or go for walks. I want a more mature manly friendship. Someone that I cann go to the bar with have a beer talk about life and do sporty things with. I would be really happy if I had a gym buddy and started a workout routine. No one really seams interested tho. I guess that I am at an age where people concentrate on romantic relationships rather than friendships. I only have my parents to talk to who I live with. Im close with my younger sister but she has her own life now. Im not really that good socially with people. Im not the light of the party but I still want to have people that I can spend time with. Maybe I should concentrate on dating once I get in shape. Im too overweight to be dating now. Young women dont want to be with an out of shhape guy. I also dont have a job, but I recieve disability every month. I think that I need to get in shape and then get a job and maybe then things will turn around for me. I just dont know if im capable.",loneliness
Never Feel Lonely Anymore,"With this method, you escape negative feeling spiral & feel less alone. Do you know the feeling of suddenly feeling terribly lonely? They want to make plans for the weekend, but all their friends seem to be planning something. You decide to go for a walk or a sport and maybe go to the cinema in the evening. And then discard everything, ignore your cell phone when it rings, and wrap yourself tightly in a blanket at home. A couple of doctors now want to have found a way out of this vicious circle.  There are many people around the world who feel lonely. The best example is Korea, where one third of all citizens live alone. From the isolation of the people, even a new profession has developed - a Korean woman earns, for example, at the 6,600 euros per month to cook in front of a web camera dishes and then to eat. It's a surreal way to keep people who are watching you company.

A way out of the vicious circle
But you do not have to put up with the feeling of loneliness. John and Stephanie Cacioppo have explored the phenomenon of inner emptiness. They have found out: Our brains react differently when we feel lonely. We are then polarized differently, react much more sensitive *. I first heard about their research when I write my research paper at the university. I never have thought that it would be useful to me. In such a state of feeling one gets easily into a negative behavioral spiral: Although one feels alone, one is socially even more off. Because, for example, you are afraid of being rejected by strangers or even friends. This pattern of behavior, the two doctors from Chicago are sure, can be overcome. And with the following four steps:
The ""Ease Method"" (EASE Method)
The steps, writes dr. Cacioppo on the Psychology Today ** website may seem very obvious and unsurprising at first glance. But that is often the case with custom-made life-wisdom: in reality, you did not explain how we tick. You only have one thing to do if you really want to change something: Give this test a fair chance.

1. E, how to broaden your horizons. The retreat and passivity of loneliness are a protective response to a potential threat. In order for you to train yourself to deal differently with this menacing feeling, you need a safe place to experiment. You have to start small. Do not immediately try to find the love of your life or to completely reinvent yourself. Just put your toe in the water. Opt for voluntary social service, for example in a refugee camp or hospital. Learn how to work with older people, teach children, read the blind or help out in a children's sports club.
2. A like action plan. Some feel like they have nothing under control. It is enough to realize that you are not a passive victim, but can take things into your own hands by changing your thoughts, actions and expectations towards others. This can be magical and give you a real boost of energy. The next step is to realize that you are actively deciding where to invest your energy. For example, maybe a theater company is not right for you, but you could help backstage, and so get connected. If you are shy of people, you can get involved with animals and have a lot to talk about. But: social connections do not require superpowers. Do not make too much for others, but do it for yourself. Be open to engage in something but combine this with realistic expectations. Means: Do not fret too much - you do not have to become Mother Theresa right away.
3. S as selection. The secret in dissolving loneliness is not the quantity but the quality of friendships. The connections you make with people must be meaningful and satisfying for both parties. You have to find out which friendships promise this and which ones are going in the wrong direction. Loneliness makes us very sensitive to signals, the trick is to stay calm and learn to appreciate the signals correctly. In addition, one must keep reminding oneself that it is not a good basis for a deep connection when one feels attracted to a person's appearance or status. Compatibility depends on much more, such as belief, opinion, interests and common activities. The principle ""Equal and like to join"" works well here: Calmer people should also seek to talk to people who like it calmly. Enthusiastic readers should rather go to reading clubs instead of dance clubs.
4.E for Expect the best. Social comfort makes us more stable, generous and resilient people. It helps us to be more optimistic and the ""expect the best"" attitude just gets the best out of us. Warmth and goodwill are unparalleled. With practice, each of us can change as seen from the outside. Fear and critical behavior force you back into loneliness. Focus on very small recognitions from the outside, expect the best, but be modest. Be patient and do not over-interpret things.
* So different is the way to go: The test persons of the Cacioppos were shown words in different colors. The subjects then had to name the color, not the word. Some of the words describe social activities that have a positive connotation, such as ""party"". Others went in the negative direction, like ""lonely"". The brain waves of the subjects were measured.
The ""lonely souls"" were a lot more sensitive to certain words, like those who had a good social network. So some words worked like small electric shocks on some subjects. The doctors said it was important that lonely people are aware that their brains are more sensitive and influence their behavior.

Does Anyone Remember The Old IM System On This Sit,"Some years back, Dailystrength had an IM system like FB & people could just randomly begin chats with one another. I use to spend hours chatting away with other lonely people but those days are gone. Would anyone like to maybe chat on FB, email, or text?",loneliness
I feel uncared for in my home,"I hope this makes sense. Let me start this off by saying I'm turning 15 in about a week. The past couple of days my mom has been more detached from me than usual, and several times I'm not even sure if she's home or not. Not only am I pretty bad at explaining my feelings, I have a kinda bad problem where I can remember details well, but not events. Lately though I've been realizing that often, much of attention I'll get from her is negative, whether it's her criticizing me or being excessively negative about something else (like yelling at people in the car for half an hour).
Another thing is that more and more I have to make my own dinner, and she tells me it's because I'm growing up but I was never taught how to cook and it's pretty sudden. Many times I have to fight for her to make me breakfast especially since she wakes up later than me. I get really sick of eating the same cereal. Sometimes it'll be the afternoon by the time I've eaten breakfast. By the time I'm supposed to be eating lunch I've already filled up on snacks. For a while I've also had to fight her to be able to use the shower, since I use the one in her room-- mine is unusable for a few reasons. I've had to skip days I wanted to shower because her room reeks of smoke. I feel like I should also point out I'm her only child, and the only other household member besides two dogs.
Apart from anything like that I've stopped trying to tell her about my problems or interests because they always turn into an argument. I talk and act different around her, I stop smiling if I know she's looking, and try not to say anything that she'll try and turn around on me. I can never remember the last time she's genuinely apologized. I lock my door a lot more and look forward to school more lately.

Am I melodramatic??? What do I even say if I want to stay somewhere else? My dad has never had custody of me and from many visits as well as staying with him once maybe a year ago, I can tell the atmosphere is bad with him. I don't know what to do...",loneliness
I Had Another Dream Last Night,"It was like most of the dreams I have. I'm a mother with a very protective, strong, loving, caring, and gorgeous husband. How does that happen? In my dreams I feel deeply loved and cared for, it's the most strangest, most torturous experience. The dreams are so vivid and feel so real, then I wake up to my empty, cold, and lonely reality, my god...how life is so cruel. I have a daughter and I have come to realize how much parents, (women in particular) use their children to fill a void. I have been told in previous post ""focus on your daughter"" or ""be glade you at lest have your daughter"". But the truth is, children can not fulfill certain needs, and they can not be utilized for the ""meantime"" to bandage and prevent the wounds of their parents from being exposed. When parents do this, which most single parents do, they end up hurting their kids in the process. I'm a psychology student and have learned a lot of vital information, one of which is that adults need close, healthy, and stable bonds in life. When we don't have them, we struggle in every single aspect of life, this is a statistical fact. Everything from eating to mental health is affected when we, at any stage in life do not have close, loving, and stable relationships. Upon discovering this, everything started to make sense, nothing became easier, however, I did find some relief because I know what needs to be done. I'm in a real crappie place right now, however, I'm also feeling pretty good, I have two more weeks left of class, then I have two more semesters before transferring to a university, I'm currently studying at a community college. My daughter is happy and healthy, I have my own place, I have very little money, however, we eat good, and our bills and rent get paid, so theres a lot to be thankful for and I am. I'm really looking forward to the new year, and vow to go after the life I want, no matter how sacred it makes me. I will be going out more in hopes of meeting new friends and building a support system, doing things that I like, taking care of my health, and getting a therapist. I have felt sorry for myself for to long, I know the result of this self- loathing, I would like to see the results of me taking control of my life and navigating in the direction I want it to go. I hope all is well and that you guys had a happy thanksgiving, till next time.

Putting my thoughts on here,"I’m learning how to be single.
It’s hard.
I’m learning how to cope with my travel anxiety.
That’s harder.
When I’m not preoccupied, I use that free time treading water wishing I had a romantic connection.
When I’m about to board a plane, I use that free time worrying extensively about the flight.
How do I get over this? Will I get over it or will I just live with it? 
I always tell myself “God, I would give just about ANYTHING not to have this anxiety. It’s crippling. It’s exhausting. It’s limiting.” 
I’ve gotten pretty far with it. A year ago I couldn’t step foot in a car. I had a passenger phobia. Now I can get in a car if I really put my mind to it, but I can’t be in the car too long or my anxiety takes over. I had an anxiety attack on a plane because of the terrible turbulence. And it really was terrible. I absolutely hated it. But the other flights were much smoother. I hate flying, but prefer it over driving or being driven of course. I’m getting somewhere. But it still haunts me-this anxiety. People don’t really understand it, but as long as they acknowledge it, I feel much better. I’m trying. It’s so hard. But I’m facing it.
And then, I still have him on my mind. 
Why? Do I allow it? Is it love?
We haven’t talked in 6 months. He’s gone. He’s in another state. He’s moved on, long forgotten me.

And we were never together. Why do I feel for him STILL? Seriously? I should be over him. And I’m not. Is it my fault? I truly tried. I talked with too many guys. Met with 8. Didn’t feel a connection with any of them. Once that wears off, I think of him. Why do I feel something for someone so strongly.. someone that never wanted me the way I wanted him? He said he liked me. But just not the way I wanted him to. And yes, he was moving...far away. So I can’t blame him for being the way he was. But at the same time, I question the purpose of us sparking something that cannot grow. They say time heals all wounds. I hope that comes soon.",loneliness
Tornado of feelings,"Lately I've been feeling so alone more and more and I'm trying to put myself out there but it's hard when you think and feel is that everyone is going to leave because that is all ive ever known on top of that I deal with social anxiety.

Does anyone commit?,"I am a 19 yr old who has dated an 18 year old and currently talking to a 23 year old.  What they both have in common is the LACK OF COMMITMENT to be in a relationship.  I can understand the 18 year old, but at 23 years old I would have expected so much more.  At first, I was afraid I was not mature enough, but now I feel like it's pulling teeth to even go on a first date because of their ""complex mind, doubts, concerns, etc."".  I also understand that everyone is going through something, but then you should not have matched with me and began talking with me for two weeks already.  It hurts my heart even more, and I am only trying to romantically get back on my feet again.  Everyone around me breaks up and finds someone a couple weeks later, meanwhile I have the worst luck.
Maybe it's just me, but I am fed up with stressing myself over trying to make a connection with someone, putting in more effort, and having my heart shattered again, after already taping it back together!",loneliness
Always feeling lonely,"No matter where I am or who I’m with, there is always this feeling that I’m alone. 
My husband and I moved a few months ago and I was really lonely because I didn’t know anyone in the area. My husband kept telling me that it would get better when I started school because I would make Friends. He’s right I made friends, but I still feel alone. I still feel like I don’t have anyone in my life to turn to. I have a sister, mom, dad, husband, friends, etc, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt so alone in my entire life.  This feeling has lasted a little over 3 years and I don’t know what to do. I’m going to try and get into counseling tomorrow and maybe try medication but I can’t keep living like this.  
I cant keep living my life like this. Most of my days are fine, but who wants to live there life or exist only in a state that can only be described as fine. The days that aren’t fine, are horrible. I’m down in the bottom of the ocean drowning in sorrow and sadness and I can’t get out or up. 

I dont want want to be fine, or horrible. I don’t want to exist as only those to words. I want to be more, I want to be happy. I’ve been through a lot in my life, but I know I have never felt like this in my entire life and I don’t want to anymore. I don’t want to hurt anymore, I need to get better and be better and be happy and live my life without all of this fog.  I want the light at the end of the tunnel.

Feeling Lonely,"I have been divorced over a year and a half and I'm feeling very lonely. It was a tough situation that I didn't have close friends or family members nearby for a leaning support. It was never easy for me to make friends or even tried meetup groups but didn't have the same feeling or easy just to find someone as a friend. For a while, going to casino really made me happy and kept me busy but it didn't end up in a good situation by losing money :-( . All I do now is work and stay home watching tv and movies. It's getting boring each day and I feel so lonely and hopeless that I don't know what to do. I don't see the light at the end of tunnel and wish the world would just end. ",loneliness

Introvert or more,"I have known my husband for 14, and I feel lonely. It hit me when we experienced our first ED issues 6 months before our marriage and spiraled for 2-years after that, and I don't know what to do.
Counseling session, after counseling sessions, has only scratched the surface for these physiological and physical problems but that passionate-bond is gone, dwindled by our disconnect, these strong sexual needs aren't meet; I'm too embarrassed to say this, but I am so frustrated without this intimacy all I see are flaws.
So I asked myself how did I miss this...and where was my focus? Maybe it's me, but I feel like I am dying inside and the loss of time is hurting me...Whoo.. that felt good. What am I to do? ",loneliness
Light at end of tunnel!!! lonlier though,"So i have been in this sort of long distance relationship for almost a year. I do see him almost 3 days a week every week but after seeing him every day for the year before this last one it has been very hard. I really dont do lonely. I mean I got married 2 times to men that I really did not want to marry just so I wasnt lonely. Now I actually really want to be with my boyfriend and i cant be as much as I would like. 
He moved away for a really good paying job in order to pay of his bills and mine and finish his masters degree as well. Now he is actually reaching the goals he moved away for and we are talking about our next move together. This is very exciting for me but oddly enough its harder now. Im guessing that its because i can actually see and end to lonely and it is close but not close enough!!!! So frustrating!

Back to loneliness and depression,"Got into a relationship three weeks ago, which ended only two weeks in.  My partner did not feel a spark or connection apparently, even though my friends and my therapist do not think that is true, after all I told them about us.  I went from feeling safe, happy, emotionally and mentally stable, and physically comforted/loved to the COMPLETE OPPOSITE and I am in excruciating pain. I am isolated, bored, lonely, ""skin hungry"", and cannot find someone else to be with. People saying ""things will get better"" and ""you just gotta fight"" only make things worse. I cannot take this emotional agony anymore and I see no reason to keep myself in it, since it has been already about 3 years of going through this pain. But I also do not want to call for help (police or suicide hotline) even though I feel like I am at the breaking point. ",loneliness

You are the author of your life,"Found it funny that I join a loneliness support group and the first thing I see is a new button “invite friends”.. 
anyway .. I came across this today.  Made me think about why I’m where I am today and hope to find a way out.  If you want to hear it in MM voice just google it..
I’m going to talk with you about some things that I’ve learned on my journey. Most from experience, some of them I’ve heard in passing. Many of them I’m still practicing, but all of them I do believe are true.
LIFELife is not easy…it’s not. Don’t try to make it that way.Life is not fair, it never was. It never was. It isn’t now and it won’t ever be.
DO NOT PLAY VICTIMDo not fall into the trap…The entitlement trap of feeling like you’re a victim.You are not!Get over it and get on with it.
WHAT IS SUCCESS TO YOUSo the question we’ve got to ask ourselves is what success is to us, what success is to you.
Is it more money?That’s fine, I’ve got nothing against money.Maybe it’s a healthy family.Maybe it’s a happy marriage.Maybe it’s to help others.Maybe to be famous.To be spiritually sound.To leave the world a little better place than you found it.
Continue to ask yourself that question. Now your answer may change over time and that’s fine, but do yourself this favor: whatever your answer is…Don’t choose anything that will jeopardize your soul. 
PRIORITIZEPrioritize who you are, who you want to be, and don’t spend time with anything that antagonizes your character. Be brave, take the hill, but first answer that question. “What’s my hill?”
So first we have to define success for ourselves and then put in the work to maintain it. Make that daily tally. Tend to our garden. Keep the things that are important to us in good shape. Where you are not is as important as where you are. It is just as important where we are not as it is where we are.
IDENTIFYLook, the first step that leads to our identity in life is usually not “I know who I am. I know who I am.”That’s not the first step.The first step is usually “I know who I am not.”The process of elimination.
Defining ourselves by what we are not is the first step that leads us to really knowing who we are.
SPEND TIME WHERE IT SERVES YOUYou know that group of friends that you hang out with that might not bring out the best in you? You know…they gossip too much or they’re kind of shady…they really aren’t going to be there for you in a pinch. Or how about that bar that we keep going to that we always seem to have the worst hangover from? Or that computer screen, right? That computer screen that keeps giving us an excuse not to get out of the house and engage with the world and get some real human interaction?Or how about that food we keep eating? That stuff that tastes so good going down, but makes us feel like crap the next week. We feel lethargic and we keep putting on weight?well…those people, those places, those things…Stop giving them your time and energy!Just don’t go there!I mean put them down!
And when you do this, when you put them down, when you quit going there, when you quit giving them your time…You inadvertently find yourself spending more time and in more places that are healthy for you. That bring YOU more joy.Why?Because you just eliminated the Who’s, the where’s, the what’s, and the when’s that were keeping you from your identity.
Trust me…too many options will make a tyrant of us all. So get rid of the excess, the wasted time. Decrease your options. And if you do this you will have accidentally, almost innocently, put in front of you what is important to you by process of elimination.
Knowing who we are is hard. It’s hard.Give yourself a break.Eliminate who you are not first.And you’re going to find yourself where you need to be.
Instead of creating outcomes that take from us, let’s create more outcomes that pay us back, fill us up, keep your fire lit, turn you on for the most amount of time in your future.
CREATE THE LIFE YOU DESIREWe try our best. We don’t always do our best.Our architecture is a verb as well and since we are the architects of our own lives…Let’s study the habits, the practices, the routines that we have that lead to and feed our success, our joy, our honest pain, our laughter, our earned tears.Let’s dissect that and give thanks for those things. And when we do that, guess what happens?We get better at them!And we have more to dissect.
BE DISCERNING…Choose it because you want it.Do it because you want to.We are going to make mistakes…get over it. You got to own them and then you got to move on. Guilt and regret kill many a man before their time. So turn the page, get off the ride. You are the author of the book of your life!

This is my first time on this website annd my first thing writing on this party because I feel lonely, hopeless, shy, and ignored. I want to find people that need a friend not only just to talk to but to understand the things I am going through. I anyone needs to talk about anything please, I am all ears. I'm lonely too and need someone to talk to so please don't be shy. Just be you! I don't mind the differences in fact I like talking to people that are different than me.

I hate being alone but I have to be,"I have social anxiety so I can't leave home a lot of times.

And usually he goes anyway by himself or with friends I'm so afraid that if I don't get over this he'll get tired of having to leave me here and go out alone and he'll leave me for a more normal and stable girl.

New to the group,"
I’m hoping to find friends that understand feeling so lonely and lost.  I live with chronic pain on a daily basis.  I try to be as normal as possible but it makes it really hard to do what most people would consider “normal” everyday activities.   I was a loner before the chronic pain took over so much of my life.   Now, I’m even more so.  I would like to change that.  ",loneliness
"Still Tormented by Loneliness, However.......","I'm still feeling pretty good. The new school smester started last month, which means that if all goes well, I will complete my degree next year. My daughter also went into the 6th grade last month, and will be 11 years-old on the 30th of this month.

As I get closer to my educational goals and as my daughter grows at lighting speed. I can't help but feel so horrible about never being in a romantic relationship. As stated in a previous post, I'm a below the knee amputee of the left leg, and believe that it's the main reason as to why I have never been in a relationship. Man have never showed any interest In me, other then sex, and it makes me feel horrible. My daughter has never seen her mother loved, respected, and cared for by a man, or even family.
We learn how to love by watching the adults in our lives love each other, however, when we don't grow up seeing love, or seeing what healthy forms of love is supposed to look like, it hinders our ability to grow into emotionally healthy adults who know how to appropriately carry on relationships with others. With that being said, I'm terrified that I have crippled my daughter in some why, I feel as though she will experience a lot of pain because she does not know what love looks like or should be. She has never known her father (he refused to deal with me after I became pregnant) so I'm scared she's going to go out into the world looking for a father, as I did.
All these thoughts and emotions leave me feeling incredibly defeated and worthless. I'm terrified for my future and my daughters future. My daughter have told me many times over the years, she wants me to get married and have another baby so that she can have a sibling and a father. It's heart breaking, because it let's me know that she is aware of things, but it also breaks my heart, because I too want thoes things, however, as stated in a pervious post, those things seem off limits for me, meaning, I'm not allowed to be happy in thoes aspects. 

I have a beautiful daughter, my own place, a car, and although I'm not financially stable, our bills are paid every month and we are able to experience nice things. The fact that I do have my independence and the fact that I am able to take care of my daughter pretty well, makes me happy, so I do experience happiness and have happiness in my life. Nevertheless, there are other forms of happiness that I would like as well. And let me say, although my daughter has never seen me loved, respected, and cared for by a man. She has also never seen me disrespected, abused, or degraded by a man. 

When my daughter was an infant,  I promised myself that I will never allow a man around my child, if he was not committed and oozing with love for me. I have yet to encounter a man as such, there for, my daughter has never known me to have any dealings with man and I have always respected myself for this. With all being said, I have been feeling overwhelmed and incredible lonely as of lately. I have no friends or family to confined in, which compounds the pain. Nevertheless, I'm also feeling pretty good and hopeful for certain things, I'm guessing because the last four months of the year are my favorite and good things tend to happen during thoes months.
I really want to come on here more, however, school and mommy duty takes up so much of my time. Nonetheless, I'm going to make a conscious effort to get on here more to journal and meet new people. Thanks for allowing me to vent my pain and frustrations, I hope all is well with you all and look foward to hearing from some of you.

new member,"Hey Everyone,
   My name is Tiffany but people refer to me as Tiff. I am 25 years old and has come from a past of trauma that effect me now as an adult. I see a very supportive counselor who referred me to this site. I lately have been feeling so alone and like everyone is leaving me. When I start to feel like that I get depressed and hide in my room and fight everyone away. I guess you can say I push them away. I lost my grandma in 2006 which her 12 year anniversary is coming up. My grandmother raised me and when she died that’s when life took a bad turn. I sit here today wanting to be with her and I still have the words from my birth mom that my grandmother was the only one who wanted me. So here I think everyone is leaving and it’s just me and I’m all alone because the one person who wanted me is dead. I hate this feeling and I wonder how many others feel lonely? Any input would help.",loneliness
stressed and feeling alone,"kinda longing for some socialization but I am a little scared to admit it to other people. It feels weird to sound desperate, so I put on this casual, nonchalant front... I am super scared of rejection. I cant even ask my boyfriend if he wants to hangout tonight. I was only implying it, like ""I msg this friend to see if they wanted to hangout this evening"" blah blah blah. I even said I was free this evening...
I am being indirect because of scared of him saying no to me. Though I want to see him... why cant I just say that? Im putting up this front because im scared to be vulnerable. I still tried... I texted a few people but I dont know what going on tonight... Anxiety is telling me to just leave it be, and stay home alone. But been alone all week and i am pretty tired of it. I went out by myself already yesterday, but most days I am alone.
After a stressful medical visist, had an argument with the boyfriend and he said some things bout indepedance and seperate lives, or whatever And him just saying it like I am a needy, whiny kitten. And it makes me feel bad that I have this need of support right now. And I dont know how to feel...
my anxiety was so high this week due to medical stuff. And I dont know why I am feeling so needy this week... Im scared to admit my weakness of wanting to just be with someone and hangout. I cant help feel bothersome, everyone else is going about their busy lives  - but thats maybe my anxiety talking. Yet makes me dizzy to think about it. I wish I could just say ""I want to see you"", but Im afraid he will just say ""I know"" and do nothing about it.",loneliness

feeling pushed aside... Overreacting?,"Maybe I am overreacting, as I am overwhelmed by so much right now, particurilarily as I am waiting for surgery, I cant help feel so weak and needy, wanting support. 
I just feel my boyfriend is pushing me aside. Maybe its bad timing, his sister is in town and he is trying to be attentive towards her. She is really introverted and indescive, very quiet and a home body person. Its like you cant suggest anything to her, BUT at the same time she doesnt tell you want she wants. I dont know... thats her personality. She has a 'history' which I cant hold against her because I too have a history... [mental illness/ bad relationships etc]
But thats not what fustrates me, its the fact that I feel whenever I try to engage and have an open dialogue with him I am shot down. Yesterday after going to see my surgeon, I was feeling stressed out and he made it worst. Making me feel I am not enough and talking about indepedance and seperate lives... but right now I am desperate for support.
Of course - I love my indepedance, I want a career and all that. But I dont understand why he is bringing up all that stuff now when I need him the most before surgery. It makes me feel so alone, and its like he is creating this distance. I cant even suggest a plan to hang out because EVERYTHING depends on his sister - I dont know why this annoys me. Shouldnt I respect that, give them space, why do I have this knot in my chest? it is sweet and kind he is helping and regarding his sister but maybe its horrible timing when I am just overwhelmed and needing support... than he has to give a whole lecture about being by myself and being indepedant, having seperate lives which makes me feel horrible right now. I feel fustrated with him and myself. Wish I could just be content with this solitude... I already spend most days alone. I hardly saw him even when his sister wasnt in town.. 
I dont see him after my doctors appointments though I wish I could, but Ive learned not to expect it. One time I tried to ask to see him and I cant remember what excuses he gave but it didnt work out anyways... 
I just go home and sit by myself and listen to music, it definitly gets lonely at times.
Any advice on how to deal with the fact that he has to take care of his sister. I know, I sound bad I SHOULD BE OKAY WITH that BUT TRUTH IS AM I not. Boy I sound needy, i JUST NEED TO BE OKAY WITH IT.. but i dont know how...? its tough to think I have to give him the distance he wants when I need him for pre-surgery. ",loneliness

Need to vent,"I have no one I can talk to besides a therapist, one true friend and my husband. However, I don't want to always be a burden on my husband and friend since I always go to them. I need to start standing on my own two feet, but I still need to vent now and then, so here I am.
I went on a girls trip.
One girl got lost, so I went to go find her. Upon finding her (in a loud club) I asked where she was and why she wasn't returning our calls or texts. She dragged this out to say that I yelled at her and that I abandoned her. I shook this off to her being drunk. 
I decided to go ahead of the group to meet them where we were going in hopes of getting us a table faster. Upon their arrival to meet me, one of the girls yelled at me in a very belittling way. (I have so much problems and anxiety from my past that being yelled at really spins me into depression and anxiety). I asked her to calm down several times, but she refused to and at that point I had to walk away from her.

Flash forward to after the trip. I decided to reach out to the girl that yelled at me. I expressed to her that her conversation could have waited until the next day, and that I was highly offended, and hurt about how she went about speaking to me. 
She never responded.
Instead, a day later her best friend (also on the girls trip) reached out to me that she didn't think this person was being mean, even though she wasn't there during this conversation with me. Then proceeds to tell me that the first girl was upset that I yelled at her (which i never did). She then proceeds to drag this into a group chat so they can talk it out, but not to ""Attack me"". I thought this whole thing was ridiculous the night it happened, and for these girls to be still so upset a week later really sucked. Instead of responding to me, the first girl responds to my husband, which really crossed a line with me. She said she wouldn't talk to me, but sent my husband a paragraph saying that I am playing victim and I am wrong. 
I even expressed to the first girl that she was very rude when I went to find her, and I didn't appreciate it. I did offer everyone a genuine apology because apparently everyone (except for one) was upset with me. Although I apologized, these people want me to grovel at their feet. And one of the two girls I told were not the nicest to me, said that ""that's your opinion and you are entilted to it"", while the other hasn't said a single word to me.
This has really upset me, and put me in a really sad and lonely place. Only one person from the trip has reached out and checked on me in a loving and caring way.  
I don't know what to do. I am really upset that I got singled out, but other people's behaviors were worse and they don't feel like they need to apologize to me. I have contemplated calling them one on one and addressing the situation, but I don't know if that would do anything but make the matter worse.

Why do I feel this way?,"I don’t like to talk about my past, but maybe it explain why I feel so lonely. I used to live with a bipolar narcissistic mother. She would constantly threaten me to do things for, and if I didn’t I’d be living in hell. I have a severely autistic twin brother, and I have Trichotillomania.
ive recently begin to notice that I’m slowly distancing myself away from friends. My stepmom constantly encourages me to hangout with friends on the weekend, but I always come up with excuses why I couldn’t. I would even stop hanging out with my best friends. I absolutely dispise feeling this way. Most days I’d rather be in my room playing on my phone with my dog by my side. I don’t think it’s depression, I’ve been to countless therapists/doctors and I’ve only one doctor who diagnosed me with depression, but that was when I was in third grade (I am not a sophomore).

It may affect my career and personal life. So, I want to better my hearing abilities before things go out of my control. I got to know about a hearing aid specialist in Toronto.

I'm just ready for a friend now, not some profile I just talk to on a screen that is only amiable so as long as I fulfill a condtion. If anyone is reading this & feels similar then offer me an invite, and let's iron out all the details so that we can be free of any games/insecurities that might harm our potential, positive relationship",loneliness
New To the Group,"Hi everyone!
I am one who likes to be alone for the most part. But often times find myself having those pangs of realizing I am lonely and don't have that ""plus one"" to do those activities that you cannot do by yourself. Or should I say the ones you can do by yourself but you just don't want to anymore?
But in my case to bring anyone into our lives would mean having to expose all of our ""issues"" mine and my children's. And then it would mean having to adjust yet another schedule to make our schedules work. And ya'll truthfully I am tired enough as it is to even think about juggling one more thing in the air. Oh, my word that would be the straw that broke like ten camels backs, all at once! lol (well at this point in time for our dramatic lives that involves some pretty special kids with special needs and sometimes special attention requirements).
Man, just thinking about having a companion exhaust me. I am a full-time student, a full-time mom of a teen and a 8-year old (thinking he is the man). And a punching bag and doormat for those two little ones sometimes.
So I guess it is easier to come here and complain. And to just dream about having someone to hang with. Because the reality of our life is my kids first, me second""ish"", my school last and sleep mixed up in there somewhere. Having friends is hard to. I am too tired when my kids go to their dad's to socialize much. I need to sleep and study.
Bottom line I suck as a friend. I forget to call my friend's back or show up for scheduled events. I do at least answer the phone when called and reply to text promptly.
Does anyone else get this? I barely have enough time in between m studies to write this. But at least I can reach out to adults. Because even going to college ( A university where I am close to being the very few ""older persons"" on campus-minus the professors)- I still only have interactions with kids there. And at least reaching out here I can see if there are other adults who do have the same struggle of wanting to not be segregated (so to speak) but situation (life and kids and exhaustion and laziness) kind of dictates it at the moment.

Thank you for letting me share

Fantasy Football,"Let me start by saying I hate sports. Don't get them, don't play them, don't watch them. Sure as hell don't respect athletes.
I am so sick of dating guys who like sports. Everyone says ""oh be glad he isn't doing something bad."" When I met my current man, I thought there was no way he was into sports. He was an emaciated dork with glasses and super shy. But no he is obsessed with football for some reason. This year is his worst. Idk if he is paying so much attention to football because he quit drugs or what. I am so lonely. He pays no attention to me whatsoever and I presume it will be this way all winter. He has that fantasy football shit on his phone. I don't get it. It's so dumb. He is detatched and obsessed with something that isn't real, which is based on something else that is dumb and doesn't matter.
He barely texts me when he is at work. He will go all day some days and not text me and when I complain he says it's because he was too busy talking to people about fantasy football. He comes home and is on his phone even at the dinner table. He has been making his own dinner consisting of pizza rolls instead of eating with me and Mom. He spends his whole day off, according to mom, in bed on his phone. He comes home tired and goes to bed early, then gets up after I fall asleep so he can go watch football on TV. Last night I wanted to play a game with him and he said he couldn't. He was too busy playing Madden football video game, which is also super boring.
What really pisses me off is if I'm on my phone or try to watch TV with mom he gets all jealous and nosey. I don't say shit about what he does.

Its Your Choice," Its your choice



Seems like after time you come to realize that people

may know what they want but they are mainly scared

of change. Lots of time some people have someone holding

somesomething over their head. I believe thats the main

thing that puts in thier head that they cant live without the

other person. Its a type of mental abuse. No matter If the

person is good or bad or does anything at all wrong in thier life.

Now this isn't about me.

 

That person can be a kind person but the dis-belief they have

built up on the inside and a person can be told something some

many times that they can start to believe it them selves. It takes

alot to stay with that type of person and not believe the things

they say when your supossed to trust each other thats where it

happens at. Some many people use that to keep the one there

with close so they can feed off the pain they have caused. It

makes them feel as if they are powerful. In control, many things

and they tend to love the feeling. 



If this is happening to you and you read this, GET YOUR HEAD 

BACK AND MIND!!!!! I can say i see this happening alot and when

the other trys to get away they use things that person loves to keep

them around. I see and here this everyday but It seems not everyone

can. We can only help those that want help. It kills me to see people

being done this way.   

Most of the controlive typses in life come from a home or a school

where either they was misstreated, abused,unhealthy home or bullied.

I was bulllied alot when i was young but I ended that but in a way

became a bully myself but in a different way but some grow out that

stage and i did. So, why do do these people do this. Well my answer

is the need to feel power and knowing they have power over you as well.

Seems every turn theres no way out. Kids invloved? Well that more of

enough reason to leave, saftey of kids. They are systems for stuff like that.

Like here its the family justice center. 

If you are involved in something like that either victim or the abuser,

GET HELP!! Reach out to someone. People think itll just make it worse.

What worse being a toxic relationship or being someone where you can

feel peace. They are good people in the world that work the system and

do want to help.Housing, protections,beds and things, food. There are alot

of place and peple that can help. Even if you think theres no way out.



These people set up therapist for and your kids and get help for the ones

causeing the abuse if they decied they want help as well. Ive been down

this road and its not a fun road, itsa confusing road but when you truely

want out youll get out no matter what it takes. 



This even goes out to the addicts its the same thing if your relationship

is causing you to use or making you think of useing then get out. If that

person truely had any type of feelings towards you they would change,

get help. It took me 6 years to get out of a 12yr relationship so im not to

say its easy, im here to it can be done.

Bored at Work,"My job is so boring. I have way too much down time and just sitting still at my job. I can't really get up and move around much because I have to be at my desk to assist customers when they come in.

I worry what if my boss thinks I'm lazy? I work one of the busier jobs here, but I have never been able to milk a job to take more time. I'm fast and efficient, but I still feel like I have a lot of down time, just playing on my phone or reading books.

What does it mean?,"Loneliness.
Are you lonely in a crowd or are you isolated and alone? 
Can anyone help me figure out my behaviour?
I'm beginning to doubt myself. I think I'm feeling loneliness, yet I don't do anything to change my situation. I don't feel comfortable with most people I know. When I'm amongst people, even those I know well, I can't wait to escape them and return to solitude. I don't make arrangements to meet friends. I don't enjoy seeing my family (outside of my son). I'm also becoming increasingly disillusioned by people, by the general public, in the encounters I have.
Is this loneliness or something else I need to explore about myself?
I wonder if I'm destined to be mostly by myself, and whether I actually prefer this. I just feel something is missing in my relationships with my fellow human beings.

I have been a firm believer of God since i was little,my mother raised me to love and fear God and i kept the faith till afew years ago.....i still believe in God but sometimes i find myself doubting his existence, i wonder why he let me fall into such a situatiion,i asked for strength to resisit the temptation and overcome but none came,i fell and i cant seem to be able to pick myself up again.i commited a sin against God and i feel he presence no more and i have difficulties praying, i know he is forgiving but i cant seem to forgive myself for what i did.i have turned to a vice that is eating me up but i cant seem to stop cause its the only way i seem to find release.i dont know what to do.....i want to feel his presence again.
im surrounded by people who love but i still feel lonely because i feel so far from God.

Mornings can be brutal,"Unless I have something planned to complete or look forward to, mornings can be ever so lonely. I feel the more obvious loneliness along with the depression and anxiety. I guess my biggest worry is when I am no longer able to do some of my daily routines. Because of circumstances, getting out to volunteer, walks and leaving home much is not really an easy option. Guess I'm not looking for a fix, just my morning thoughts as I'm feeling them now. Wishing all a good day!",loneliness

"Back to school, back to loneliness","I started school on August 23 and I was actually really excited about it because I'm thinking that maybe this year will be different. However when I went to school, nothing changed. I'm still invisible to almost everybody. Everybody avoids me for no reason. I sit by myself at lunch. If teachers didn't have to take attendance, nobody would notice that I'm gone. Over the summer, I was feeling confident about this school year, but just on the first day, I lost every single shred of confidence that tooks months to build. 
I know being invisible is better than being bullied, but I hate feeling like I'm not even there. I only have 3-4 friends but they are not in any of my classes or my lunch period. It's also very humiliating when we have to get into groups and I am the only person left because nobody wants me in their group and the teacher has to put me with a group. 
I know that this will past but I don't want the main thing I remember about high school was that I was invisible. It's not like I want to be the popular girl. I just want people to awknowledge my existance.

Don't know where to start,"Hi everyone 
I'll begin from the start. First of all I am dying,  I have heart disease, there are  3 arteries in my heart that need stents, trouble is they are to small to stent and my only option would be a triple bypass, the cardiologist refuses to operate as I have COPD and it would be to dangerous .
Anyway I'm a 66 year old male,  I have a wife but she had an affair 3 years ago. Like a fool I forgave her and it was OK at first.  Then after a while she said I could divorce her if I wanted too but she wouldn't have to move out as we are joint owners of the house . Since then life has been hell for me. I know she is still having this affair but all I can do is grin and bear it.  This has led to me getting severely depressed.  
My daily life is getting up about eight oclock and sitting in the kitchen drinking tea. When she gets up she doesn't speak to me at all.  This goes on all day till at 9pm she goes to work as she works nights.  Over the past 3 years my depression has also give me high blood pressure ,ocd, social phobia, agrophobia. 
I go weeks on end without seeing a soul. I look forward too my doctors appointments just to see and talk to someone. 
It breaks my heart when she goes out with her fancy man but dare not say anything as she denies it and starts ranting and raving like a mad woman, so I say nothing and just puts up with  it.  Pathetic isn't it?

Feeling lonely and no one to talk fo,"Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about my life, that past relationships I’ve had mostly especially with this one girl. She was something and still is. We are no longer a thing, obviously, but everything about her has been on my mind recently. To bring some perspective into this she broke up with me last year in November. I don’t know why she appears to come on my mind from time to time and what makes things worse is that I’ll be seeing her around me a lot more. It’s stupid to think that I might still be in love with her after all these months but I can’t shake it off, well not completely at least. Can anyone give me some advice? I’ve been trying to get help for a while but none of my friends seem to care much anymore. ",loneliness

I've always been one of those people that has one really really close friend that I tell everything to and do everything with, but now that I'm an adult relationships are a lot harder to build then they use to be. I don't like having a bunch of friends that I can't talk to about personal stuff with.  I really just want deep connections with people but, it seems so hard to get past the acquaintance stage.

Nearing my breaking point,"I've been going through a lot of stress lately and it wasn't until recently that I realized the impact that it's been having on me. While I'm generally known for being an outgoing and social and supportive person, I've resigned myself over the past year to a work - home - sleep routine. Over the last year I've lost my only parent whom I had a complicated non-relationship with, I have felt trapped in a job and career where I no longer feel I belong, have been a target of + lost connection to certain family members as a result of their own serious mental health struggles, my own chronic health issues gave me some physical and financial setbacks and more recently is the realization yesterday that I will have to put my cat down very soon since her cancer treatment is no longer working. The world seems to be changing so fast around me and yet I seem to be stuck in circumstances that I have very little control over and keep me from moving forward. 
I've been dealing with the majority of this on my own. I don't have family I can really connect with for support I've realized that the bulk of my friendships are circumstantial, which means they aren't necessarily people I feel I can call on for a shoulder to cry on. I keep relying on the same few people and I'm afraid of exhausting them with my problems knowing that they have their own stuff they deal with. The weight of it all is starting to get to me.
I'm desperate for a sense of stability in my life. I'm tired of feeling like I have to fight this all on my own. I'd love an opportunity to just breathe easily and enjoy life and people more...it's been so long since I felt like I could. I've tried reaching out and building a new social network but my stress makes it very hard to feel connected and communicate to others. I'm thinking about going back to therapy but it would still be nice to be able to connect with people that can relate to and don't have to pay to talk to lol.

Feeling very lonely,"Hello everyone my name is Michelle I have not been on here in a long time but I just need some support because I don't know what to do anymore. I am a 31 year old that has anxiety I also have a learning disabilty which makes it difficult to be accepted and make friends. This is where it gets hard for me to where I am starting to suffer depression because my anxiety is getting high now. The friends that I have also have a learning disabilty and they live 30 minutes away from me. I have a guy friend coming from out of town this weekwho used to live here who calls me daily muliple times a day. Up until a month ago I was seeing him here everyday he is staying at our firends house. Keep in mind my friend that lives here I have always offered to help her out whenever she needs she doesn't drive so I help cause I just feel like a good person. She talked to him a month ago saying I was obessed with him which I wasn't he clearly calls me everyday. She complains to be about other people, I have been unvited to see him and the events they are doing while he is here then they invite me back and they uninvite me. She has even ended the friendship but we worked it out I thought but then days later texted me saying she is forced to be my friend. I realize I just not have someone like that in my life there is another friend when I go to visit who says the same thing she says I need to stop going down there after I put in hard work to help her out. My friends have never stood up for me. The reason I put up with it is because I don't have any other friends I have tried to go to meetings around me area where once again I wasnt accepted. My guy friend who is coming into town asked me out last December begging me to move to his state but then he didnt want to wait. I am so embarrest with my life I feel like I have no friends I am being forced to live somewhere that is not right for me I am not happy at all I have tried everything. I have never been asked out on a date and im 31 who has not had a boyfriend before and now I am losing friends. What have I done to deserve all this hurt.

Friends,"I am excited. I get to hang out with a friend that I haven't seen in a few months. I try to stay in touch but he and his husband both work alot and very busy. My fiance and I double date with them sometimes but I used to go to their house alot and have a good time.
I have been reading a book about introverts. I am introverted, and I suspect most of my friends are as well. I am learning that often when I don't hear from a friend for awhile it isn't because they are rude, they are just like me and like staying home, don't want to bother me, or are nervous about social situations.
I want to make a goal to reach out more. Yesterday I tried really hard to get a friend to come with me to an event after work. She said she had a lot of sewing to do and a deadline to meet so she would feel guilty going out when she shouldn't be procrastinating. I understand. I try to put my work first too. The prob is she always has other plans when I try to reach out. She is hard to talk to as well. I really don't think she dislikes me but it makes having friends hard when they are always busy.
My other friend that I will see tomorrow is always fun. I hope I can think of plenty to talk about. I have learned that it is good to ask introverts questions to get them to talk so they don't feel left out, and then listen. I miss some of my other friends. They rarely invite me to do anything. It's just hard to maintain friendships after many years. People naturally drift apart. I honestly am so absorbed in work and personal and family stuff, I forget about my friends. I feel like I should still get invited to hang out even after not talking to someone for a long time.
At least my friend tomorrow is that way with me. We always stay friends even tho I don't live nearby and only visit a few times a year.
I hope to learn more things soon about myself and making friends. I used to have more and I saw them frequently so that I could get out of the house. Then when I started dating my ex I wasn't really allowed to have friends or anyone over. He played my introversion against me and I feel like there is still a wedge between my friends and family because of him. They didn't see me drifting away as his fault but mine.
My current fiance encourages me to make friends and see them so I plan to mend some of these friend issues I've been having.",loneliness

Revelations,"Hello everyone.
I have been depressed most of my life. I have never worried about the number of friends I had. I never even considered that I was alone, or lonely. Only recently has it become a real concern. Besides the depression and the nuances of everyday life I have been very angry, and defensive, and acted in probably some not very nice ways. In one of the many arguments that I have been apart of my boyfriend asked me if I was happy, which my response changes based on what I am thinking about. For the most part, I am happy, I have a job that pays almost all of my bills, I have a roof over mine and my family's heads, we are all feed, and able to do a little extra. I have an amazing life, but even so, I do not always feel happy. I feel sad. Now part of this is some of the events in my life, like not having one of my children all of the time, and having little to no self-esteem. But sitting at work and at home I feel jealous of the people I work with, and the events going on in their lives. I realized a few days ago that it is not the events themselves that I feel jealous of. (A little jealousy comes from buying a house, and getting married, but only because those are kind of like symbols of change.) But more so I am jealous of the relationships that these people have not only with each other but with the outside world. I feel sad because I feel like a goldfish looking out of the bowl, perfectly able to see everything going on, but not being able to participate because of my bowl. Next question now is how do I get over 'my bowl' and learn how to make friends and keep them? Any suggestions?",loneliness
The Existential Crisis Called Loneliness,"Hey everyone,
I'm writing today to express how loneliness actually feels. 

Loneliness isn't the absence of people. It isn't the absence of tasks, things to do, places to be, goals to achieve, milestones to tackle, achievements to nab. Loneliness exists within the dark, deep corners, the hidden crevices that all these trophies can create. The deep, riveting valleys that are otherwise surrounded by families, peers, friends, co-workers.
Loneliness is the deep, painful, bitter feeling of darkness that exists even and absolutely when one is standing under the hot sun. Even if your skin feels the burn, your heart is still standing out in the cold, in the darkness. If only the light of the sun could, one day, penetrate into your skin to touch your heart and bring it to life.
Loneliness, ultimately, exists everywhere. It is inside us. No matter how filled our schedules are, our hearts will always make time to feel this painful, deep, depressing feeling. 
The question then is, how do our hearts feel less lonely even if we are swamped on the outside?",loneliness

Irritable,"Do you ever feel like your loneliness gets comfortable? And when it does, and you are used to doing things by yourself, do you feel extra irritable toward other people? Like when they disrupt your routine, do you just think omg shut up I want to go back to what I was doing!
I often feel like this because I am a loner. I have always been a loner because most people get on my nerves and I don't fit in with them. Its weird tho because some times I get lonely. Sometimes when I'm at work or out running errands I feel like I am invisible or I am the only person there. Like the crowds of people around me are just energy and not real people. Sometimes I wish I had friends to talk to. I just have my fiance, which is at least one person, but I feel like a weirdo because I don't have other friends to hang out with.
Most people get on my nerves. I havent felt well lately and it has made me more irritable. Yesterday I had to deal with such dumbass customers I wanted to cry. It's like how are some people allowed out of the house with a brain that dead? If more people were educated and polite they would be so much nicer to talk to. But instead they base nothing on facts and define reality only by the other dumbasses around them and their opinions. So no wonder I feel alone. I don't stay super busy or stir up constant drama. I just sit back and try not to get involved because the way it seems to me is people like me don't get rewarded. Well Behaved, educated, decent looking. But I get ignored, taken for granted, passed over, or flat out made fun of and called stupid by people I can guarantee have an iq at least 10 points lower than me. Lately it has really been bothering me. I don't like feeling like a kid in school in my adult life. I used to work myself to death at rough jobs and try to dumb myself down as much as possible just to fit in. But now I have a good job and I have to behave here. It's hard to fit in without being able to use my alter ego. So now I just feel bored and lonely again. I keep quiet and try my best to ignore how mad some customers make me. It just makes me want to burst when someone has the nerve to talk to me like I am stupid when I can't understand them because they can't read write or speak without a severe speech impediment. I try to be as helpful and polite as I can. Sometimes I just want to go to the toilet and throw up. Idk why other people are irritating me so much. I dreaded coming to work today because I had idiots yesterday. Sometimes they come back the next day and try the same crap. Insisting they know more about how my job works than I do. Listen to the facts not the gossip, people!
Ok I'm done venting. Hope the rest of yall lonely people aren't dealing with dumbasses too.",loneliness
POS Bums Get On My Fucking Nerves!!!!,"Do you ever get to a point where a POS person makes you angry enough to want to beat the living shit out of them??? I certainly do but I channel my anger because I know the consequences could be prison or a death chamber if I don't control myself. Case in point. Yesterday I had a podiatry appointment. I had another bum ass Lyft driver. This bum dude shows up and after he starts driving up the road says his AC doesn't work! I had to calm down because I almost knocked the hell out of him. He continued to say that he has to pay rent so he has to keep picking up customers. I said nothing else for the rest of the ride. While he was driving, I was busy trying to find the contact info for Lyft. Once I got to my destination, I immediately called Lyft to file a complaint. I cursed them out because it is their fault for hiring a broke bum ass dude to work for them. They apologized and said that drivers are not supposed to be driving if their car is not working properly. The temperature outside was around 90 degrees. The second driver I had on the way back kept complaining about women and saying how women always want money. He must be slow because what woman wants to intentionally settle for a broke bum that can't do shit for her??? 
I'm not understanding why there seems to be an abundance of bum men around today. Where I live in Georgia, the panhandling and begging has gotten really bad. Just about every time I go somewhere, there is some bum asking me for money or low key seeking somewhere to live. Each state provides assistance to those in need, so I am unsure of why these men go around hunting down women to help them. The driver I had kept looking at me and complaining about paying his rent as if I was going to offer to help him. I do not want to even use Lyft anymore, but my health insurance provides me with free rides to medical appointments so I sometimes use the service and they often have to dispatch out to Lyft if no one else is available. I get tired of drivers that hit on me, tell me about their problems, or they're trying to see if I will offer them money or a place to stay.
I am sick and tired of men with this disgusting attitude of entitlement. They can beg and use women but yet they won't go and ask for a job. Men can find jobs and hustle quicker than a woman can! I don't have much, I'm a single parent trying to raise my son, so it pisses me the fuck off when a bum dude is trying to use me. They need to go and get better jobs or find some dumb wealthy person to assist them. I'm just sick of it. But I think this behavior goes on everywhere across the world, major cities seem to be worse. I try to let things go but I am still frustrated about that Lyft experience because I could have had a heat stroke or migraine attack or I could have fainted from being in hot POS car. I would have gotten out and not taken the ride but I was in a hurry to get to my appointment and my mom got off early so she could babysit my son while I left for awhile. I will continue to pray.

"Very  disappointed, disillusioned, and discouraged","My English teacher in high school taught me to never begin writing with “I” and to use it as little as possible so every attempt will be made to do so.  After retiring, my son and daughter in law ask me to move in with them and infant daughter.  A lot of thought and consideration followed for about two years, but eventually it happened.  Things were new and we were all getting accustomed to the new home and living arrangement, everything went well for about 3 years.  Life with them has deteriorated to the point that I am constantly living in fear of being in their way, participating in daily activities around the home, or even attempting to talk to them.  Their body language, especially my sons, when I enter a room he”s in, is one of frustration, annoyance and makes me very uncomfortable.  Trying to have a spontaneous, back and forth, free from being judged, be yourself, conversation is impossible.  Instead, i am usually shutdown with comments like, “ I have to make a phone call, or I have to get this document prepared”, or “I have to get M____ ready for bed”, or “can it wait cuz I have to meet J___ and I’m running late.  These are just a few examples.  If a conversation does happen, but I soon find myself being misunderstood or judged or being giving unsolicited opinions or advice.   Isolating myself from them was the solution for awhile, but that has caused me to feel rejected and hurt so I have tried to tell them how my feelings are only to have them argue that my feelings are ridiculous.  This has been building for about two years now and it seems so hopeless.  Most of my household belongings were sold upon moving here so it would be a great expense for me to start over, and they keep saying they don’t want me to do that.  Don’t have anyone to talk to about it and emotions are really taking me over.  Feel so isolated and lonely.  ",loneliness
Salt on an Open Wound,"Just when I had a moment to lift my spirits and feel fun and carefree here comes a rain cloud...
This evening I had a chance to do something fun (a rare occurrance for me) I went to a dance audition for an arts organization in the city nearest me. I saw the posting on the career page of a website I often use and I thought it would be so much fun and it was. Later when I returned my mother brought up the fact that I always go to those events by myself and was basically inquiring as to why I don't have any friends. She'd brought this up before and though it bothered me I didn't say anything, but this evening I mentioned that I didn't appreciate the constant reminder, especially since it's something that I've struggled with. While I understand her concern with my journeys of solitude, especially with all of the violence and craziness out here, I feel hurt by the fact that something that has always pained me is thrown back in my face. Of course I wish that I had good company and a supportive group of friends to be with and not always have to go to the movies, festivals, and free yoga events by myself but that has not happened for me. My heart will always be open for love, kindness, compassion, and support but for the time being this friendless loneliness is a tinder injury that I'd appreciate if others wouldn't touch or brush up against.",loneliness
A frustrated gay girl,"Hi,
I'm almost 21, I'm gay and I've never dated in my life. Maybe the real reason is I'm not ready yet, I don't know.
Yeah my parents are homophobic, I don't have any friend who is gay. When I was in school, I'm already the kind of kid who's even more plain than a plain Jane, an easy bully target. So I don't think it's wise to give any more hint of my sexuality.
Sometimes I think of joining an lgbt club. But I wonder what I would do there. To be honest I don't care about gay politics, or gay issues really. And if I want friends straight people are fine too. Then the only reason I get in would be to try to find a date? I guess I'm thinking too much.
I'm in a very lonely and difficult period of my life. But after this, I think I'll just get into a club, just to be around people who are like me. After all, I do need people. 
I don't really have any question, just want to tell something. Thanks for reading.",loneliness
Do Support Groups Really Help???,"Hello everyone. I just wanted to check in, I hope that everyone is doing okay and had a good weekend. My weekend was okay. I finally saw that movie A Quiet Place and it was very good. There's been some Oscar buzz about the film, so I hope they do get an Oscar, all of the actors and the monsters they created were great. Good luck to all of the cast and crew!
Anyhow, I wanted to post because I often wonder whether these online support groups really help people combat thier issues like loneliness and depression. I guess I am debating whether or not being in one of these groups is really worth my time. I've had some bad experiences on here as some of you may know. I've had mean spirited and just evil people say the dumbest things even though this is supposed to be a supportive environment. So, do you think that sites like DailyStrength really help, or does it become a hindrance where no one really feels any better??? I have even felt isolated on here at times. Who the hell needs that??? And I've read posts from people who feel that they don't feel any better being on here either. For me, what has really helped me lately is just thinking positive, getting out more, and focusing on yoga and my son. I don't want any friends and I really don't have the time or patience for them. So I guess I will continue to do what is best for me and what makes me happy because being on here sometimes makes me feel worse to be perfectly honest. The world would be a much better place without mean spirited and evil people that don't deserve the right to even breathe. Sad. God bless. Have a great week everyone :)! ",loneliness
Loner,"Hi, I'm new here, and have always been kind of a loner. It's hard for me to make friends, I'm very introverted. I'm almost 70, and get cabin fever easily, so I try to get out when I have a little spending money. I live with my dog and cat. Have lots of penpals and email pals, but nobody to run around with. How do you deal with this?",loneliness
Something I wrote a few years ago,"I was here a few years ago, but I had no access to my email account to reset the password, so I recently created this new account.  A few of the things I wrote then I recently found, and have to say that I still feel this way a lot of the time.  I may post them from time to time.  Occasionally something takes me and makes me write.  Does not happen often, but it makes me fell a little better putting it out into the void, kind of gets it off my mind
It is hard to describe A blackness in your soul A knife into your very being That feeling when you stand on the edge of a mountain And look down The noise you hear in the middle of the night That jumps you awake from a peaceful deep sleep Every fear you have Comes to assault you at the same time Pounding your mind from every direction Determined that it be the one that makes it through Not feeling the touch of another Gently stroking that stray hair from your cheek Taking your hand in their’s as you walk Curling into you on the sofa as you watch TV Knowing when you awake the only thing you will see that day Is your reflection in the mirror Knowing that the only person you will talk to that day Is yourself That feeling you get when your first awake That transition from when for the briefest of moments You in your sleep have forgotten And then reality awakens And crawls its way into your conscious And you then remember You are alone",loneliness
Want to chat?,"I only posted twice so far.  Still feeling out how this works.  But tonight i am very lonely.  Its funny...i can typically never get a moment to myself and o ask for it once in a while.  Tonight i asked for company but no one is around.  
Poor timing but my heart feels horrible.  I cant explain my loneliness.  And am criticized when i try.
Does anyone experience something like this?  How do you get through it?",loneliness
I feel alone for such silly reasons.,"I'm a naturally reclusive person and I've always been quiet. It actually annoys people that I don't talk alot. The few friends I have scare me because I've been left behind or just shut out completely without explanation. So I hardly talk to them or see them. 
Romantic relationships are even harder for me because I've been cheated on, used and emotionally abused. I recently met someone that I do like but the fear of them just up and leaving or manipulating me is always there telling me it's best not to get involved.
I don't want to live like this, I want to be brave and reach out more. But I've gotten so used to people hurting me its now second nature to shut people out before anything even developes.
Are there any healthy ways to deal with these fears?",loneliness
How to,"survive this lonliness? When there is nothing and noone, where does one turn? When we can't stand our own thoughts what does one do? When we loathe our own company? When our minds are fighting against us? When the distractions all fail and we have slept as much as one can sleep what does one do? I am lost. I would be grateful for any advice or to talk with anyone. ",loneliness
Loneliness Hurts,"Here I am again in this all too familiar place. Have you ever shared your feelings with someone and instantly wanted to take it back? Loneliness is such a vulnerable place to be when you are trying hard to believe that God has a plan and a purpose for your life. For years, I have avoided dating because I tend to attract the same types of men. There always seems to be this bait and switch. I am so angry with myself for thinking that just this once, someone could actually see me. I mean really see me and think I was beautiful and wonderful enough to want to get to know on a better level. After years of not dating I decided to make an exception. There is this man that I have run into, off and on for several years, because of his job. He was always so kind and complementary to me. Expressed how much he really wanted for me call him. We had great conversations when I would run in to him but he is older than me. I am 33 and he is 53. There was also this part of me that enjoyed our conversations but never believed he was serious. I ran in to him again recently and can’t really explain what happened. I wanted to see him more so I accepted his invitation to go out. I don’t feel so special anymore. Turns out he was instantly like all the others. That evening we went from good conversation to him making sexual advances and asking if I wanted to go to the ATM like some call girl. I feel so naïve. It hurts to never be the first choice. It hurts that others have these relationships and I have never even be loved. Praying that God will help me to make better choices.",loneliness
Why Can't People Mind Their Business???,"I hope everyone had a safe 4th of July and that you are all doing well. I'm making this post because I often wonder why people feel the need to interfere with the lives of others by telling them how they should be or how they should think. So this is the corrupt and lost world we live in. We have a generation of entitled bums that expect something from everyone. I got into a debate with this lady and another guy on another site and they were saying things and trying to tell me how I should feel or that I hate men. Like WTF??? It's not about hating men, it's about having a backbone and not tolerating bullshit from an entitled POS abusive bum like I have done in the past. 
How does standing up for yourself or enjoying being single equate to being a man hater or thinking wrong??? We don't necessarily attract who we are in my opinion, but we do have an ""influence"" over who we allow into our lives. Ultimately, none of us are immune to being hurt or victimized. I did NOT choose to be abused or stalked or sexually assaulted, no woman deserves that. So when people imply that it is my fault that I'm alone or my fault that I have attracted predators, they are clearly wrong and have mush for brains. I have no problem being alone, I'm introverted. The loneliness is what is difficult, but I have always enjoyed having time to myself and going to places and events around the world with just me, myself, and I. The world would be a better place if everyone would mind thier own business like my late grandmother used to say. Don't interfere with someone's life unless they invite you to. How people choose to live is THEIR choice, not yours, and not mine. We only have control over ourselves, not others, no matter how hard we try. 
So just because someone is alone or not chasing a stank pussy or crusty dick does not mean that they want pity or even comfort from others. I certainly do not. I am happily single, embracing who I am, and learning to love myself all over again. There is nothing wrong with being single and there is nothing wrong with being in a relationship. However, there is something wrong wth trying to control others, which I find sick and very sad. 

Have a great evening and God bless. ",loneliness

Happy 4th To Everyone....,"I know the night is almost over, but I just wanted to wish everyone a Happy 4th of July :). I know many of us might feel a bit more lonely on holidays, so I just wanted to check in and see how everyone is doing. I didn't do much today, just stayed home with my son. I kind of like my holidays quiet and peaceful. Well, these fireworks are quite noisy but it will be over soon. I went out this past weekend and saw Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom with my mom and son. It was an okay movie, not great, but I like the Jurassic Park/World franchise, but lets hope this recent movie completes it for good, hopefully. Anyhow, I try not to think of being lonely and just try to get through the day by focusing on other things. 
My aunt invited me over for the holiday, but I don't really like going over to people's houses anymore, plus they keep a nasty house anyway, not for me, to be perfectly honest. And I don't like people trying to get into my business, it's annoying as fuck. My personal life, my son's ethnicity, who my son's father is or where he is is no one's business. So I mostly avoid people, keeps me out of jail! God is good, prison is NOT for me, especially here in Georgia where they have a nice death chamber waiting for some :). LOL!

Is It Wrong To Not Pursue Connections So Much???,"I'm introverted, so I just prefer keeping to myself and not even trying to make friends anymore because it always backfires or ends in disaster. Sometimes I feel as though other people want to encourage me to make connections or do things with others, but I'm not interested. I like going out by myself or taking my son somewhere, but I am DONE trying to make connections with people. Why can't people just leave people alone??? I do not want friends and I am not interested in dating or being someone's free whore at this point in my life. I have just moved on. I just want peace and a peace of mind. I'm perfectly fine as I am, just trying to raise my son and be a better person and improve my life. But I don't like how some people rub it in my face that they have friends or significant others. If things like that were so important to me, I would have stayed with my POS sociopathic ex or I would have kept other toxic people in my life. I do not want to be involved with anyone from my past as far as dating and friends go, I will NEVER go back to being used and treated like shit for no reason, I just cannot do it. 
So I just wanted to know what you all think. Since we are so lonely and many of us depressed at times, do you think it helps to pursue connections, friendships, and dating???

About me,"Hello everyone.  I am looking for an outlet to my mind and thoughts.  A place I can try and connect with someone or even a place to just cast out my mind into the void, to release the thoughts and feelings I have.  This is me.  I do not expect anyone to read it all, but I have to get it out there, so apologies for the length.  Basically my life and how I got here
Ok.  So I was watching a show on TV, My 600lb life, looking for some inspiration to get myself going.  One of the things that he guy’s therapist suggested, was for the man to write a letter to his mother, whom he thought was the root cause of his weight.  The idea was in the act of expressing all that he had been suppressing all these years, and it would then begin the healing for him.  So I thought I would give it a try

I must make a point right at the outset.  The way I am now, I have never blamed my parents, or for one second thought that they were in any way responsible for my situation.  I had a wonderful childhood with them.  It was outside the home where it all happened
Thinking back, I always thought that it was when I started Secondary school.  But if I really think about it, it had always been there, at least since junior school (7-11), perhaps even infants (5-7).  I can remember some time at infant school, little snippets of time in the playground, in the hall but not a great deal.  No real school friends as you see in the movies. Well at least I do not remember any.  That is perhaps why I think that is where it started.  I know it certainly was in junior school.  I lived on a street full of my school friends until 3rd year (age 10) and remember getting excluded all the time from activities the other kids did.  Only once was I asked to join them when they were exploring an old convent before it was knocked down.  But as I was climbing through the window frame, someone pushed past me and I ended up cutting my head on a little piece of glass that had been left in the frame.  I ran home with my head pouring with blood but not one of them bothered to go with me to see how I was
In the playground, and this may sound kind of pathetic but it has always stuck with me.  We would all play Catchy Kissy.  Basically, a boy would chase the girls around the yard, and if he caught one of them he gave them a kiss.  All innocent child fun.  But, whenever it was my turn, all the girls would walk away and didn’t want to play it anymore.  Kids are hurtful and spiteful, that is how they are.  But I always think of that as my earliest memory of me not fitting in, or no one wanted to be around
I got in a few fights as all kids do, and when I did fight, I always won.  Usually in one or two punches.  But then I was always jumped on by the others because I had won.  Didn’t matter that the other person had been teasing me for weeks, I didn’t hit them sneakily, it was always an “arranged” fight in the alley, after school.  On the field before youth club.  That lad was 2 years older than I was.  That was one punch after he had been bullying me for months and I was the one that got suspended and he got the sympathy.  So no matter what I did, i was always excluded by everyone or bullied then beaten when I stood up for myself.  I suppose that is when I started to withdraw a little.  I always thought, what was the point.  Damned if I do and damned if I don’t.  Well I do not suspect for one moment that I thought in those words, but you get the drift
3rd year juniors was when it started properly.  I remember talking to one lad and I was stood behind his chair.  I put my hand on his shoulder as I was pointing at something with my other hand.   Then suddenly I was gay because of that.  I was even more shunned and ignored than before.  4th year and age 10-11, had someone constantly bully me all year and at the end of year disco I had had enough.  The whole disco I kept walking past him and slapping him, “outside after this”, you know the kind of thing.  I never blacked out, but I felt nothing.  I was punching the wall when I was waiting for him, and I mean PUNCHING it.  And I felt nothing.  I was in sucha  rage at 11 years old, I was punching a brick wall with all og my might and did not feel a thing.  The fight went the usual way, two punches and he was down.  Then the usual ridiculing of me started and the others jumped on me for beating one of their friends.  You know when you see it in the movies and the quiet kid finally stand up for himself and people treat him like a freak for it, that was me
I was also VERY self concious of my body and weight when I was in junior school.  One sports lesson I was picked to go on the skins team (shirts V skins) and I refused to take my top off, so much that I ended up in the headmaster's office over it.  I mean, an 8 or 9 year old boy should not be having worries like that, but I guess a lot of what had been said and done to me had started to sink into my consciousness .  These are the informative years of development, and what I learned was I was useless, fat, ugly and no one wanted to be my friend
Then to secondary school.  Where it just got worse and worse.  From day 1 I was it.  1 boy tortured me relentlessly, physically and mentally at every opportunity.  “Call my mother a prostitute, I want a reason to beat you up”.  Never usually needed one.  Even when I snapped and hit back, he smashed my nose and I got into trouble.  These were the years when you start to grow and find yourself, learn all the nuances of being a person, how to act in social groups, start forming your own path in life.  Mine was a dark, dark place, full of pain and ridicule.  I went one way, once bunch of lads got me, I went the other way, a different bunch of lads got me.  No matter what I did or didn’t do, someone was always there to get me.  So my feeling of self worth even at that age was zero.  It must have been at 12 or 13 when I stood in that phone box, my pocket knife pressed into my wrist and the feeling of what a failure I was in everything (even the fact that I could not just draw that blade the 3 inches I needed to then escape it all).  That put me down to an even lower point that I suspected I could go
I did make a friend, a lad in my sister’s year.  Went well for quite a while, then he suddenly turned round and was telling everyone I tried to “bum” him.  There was that gay thing again…. He was all “yeah look how good I am” as he punched me in the face as he walked past, laughing.  Again I snapped one night at the bus stop and the usual story unfolded.  So now I was starting to learn that along with being useless, fat, ugly I was also a complete and total outcast.  It was like I must have had the plague or something
I then met who I thought was my guy.  Number 2 son as my mum called him.  We were inseparable for years, we hung out every day, went on holiday together and so on.  Then he dropped me like a piece of shit.  Everything came back ten fold.  I thought I was one of the Aikido crew also, then one night we were having a course and everyone were invited back to someone’s house to watch a movie and hang out, except me.  So now add being used to the list
At 16, I even lost a shit load of the weight (I always remember my 28” waist), and still nothing changed
I was really in the throes of depression at that stage (18) but I didn’t know it.  I became addicted to gambling on fruit machines.  For that one smallest moment of winning that jackpot, I suffered even more for years and years later.  I met my ex during that period.  And as I think back, I must have been that desperate that I put up with the being stood up all the time, the extreme jealousy in the early stages, because I could not believe someone liked me.  Yet I still gambled, I started eating again.  Things had happened to her as a child, terrible things.  But (as I now realise looking back) I concentrated on fixing her and used that as an excuse so I could ignore me.  I became so emotionally detached, I never shed a tear at my Grandad’s funeral
I am not going to go through all of that relationship in great detail.  That is not the point of this.  When I finally broke one day at work, I was then diagnosed with depression and given tablets.  They seemed to help.  The Doctor took me off them, I got worse, back on, better, off worse, back on permanently.  But for the 10 years or so I was on them I was a zombie inside.  I was so empty and dark and all the doctor did was up the dosage.  It was not until we had moved to a different town to try and save the marriage that the new doctor there changed my tablets and it was the difference between night and day.  So I thought AT LAST.  Time for me to heal
But no.  Despite all the time, and care I had put into us, she decided she didn’t love me like a husband.  And to be honest thinking back over the 23 years, it was like that from the beginning.  All the little things you do as couple for each other like waking up in the morning and there is only 1 teabag left.  So you leave it so your partner can have a drink.  She never said thank you or even did that for me once.  I should have seen the signs even then.  But no, I wanted to try and fix things.  I guess I was afraid of being alone, or perhaps thought it was my time to be looked after as I was getting to grips with the depression.  We were even trying to start a family.  But then on that day, Saturday 31st August, I found out that she had done the most hateful thing that would cause me the greatest amount of pain.  In full knowledge that it was the ONLY thing I could never forgive.  She was sleeping with someone else
There it all was again, fat, ugly, unlovable, used, despised, worthless joke
I do not remember parts of those first few months.  I remember actually starting to see the appeal of suicide and wondered the best way to do it.  I even started to research it.  One day I thought I had made a breakthrough and thought I could fix me.  Lost some weight, went to the gym, started to do things.  Then the anniversary of the breakup came and hit hit me like a steam train.  And here I am, years later sat in my flat, fatter than ever, empty, lonely and desperately trying to find a reason 
One thing is clear to me now.  I am going to be alone for the rest of my life.  I have been alone from the very start.  I have done nothing.  I have not been anywhere.  I have no stories to tell, experiences to express.  I have no social skills, having it all beaten out of me as a child.  Fat, ugly, balding worthless excuse of a man
I am a nice guy, a good guy but no one cares apart from my best friend.  She would do anything for me but has her own family to look after.  I go for days without any interaction with anyone, even at work.  There have been a couple of women I have felt something for and thought they did for me.  But as usual, my dillusions.  They don’t.  I have no interests, no skills, only food.  I fucking hate food.  I want to stop eating if I could, like cigarettes, coffee, gambling, just stop it.  I did it with them, so why can I not with food.  It has always been the one thing constant in my life I guess.  Food has always been there to comfort me.  But now I struggle to go for a walk without pain and sweating buckets.  How can a friend be a friend if they do that to me???????   Why can I not get that through my fucking thick skull??????  Am I scarred that I will truly then have nothing with that gone.  So the abuse I am now doing to myself, is better than nothing.  How totally fucked up is that.  I have to stop.  I will be dead if I don’t.  I will be one of those that people say, “didn’t someone used to sit at that desk????”
I still try to accept I am going to be alone forever now, never to feel the loving touch of another human, share the joys of being.  I see that, and almost at the point of accepting it now.  But that is no excuse to remain how I am.  If I can get healthy and lose the weight, I will at least be able to go for a walk in the country with my camera and enjoy the company of the earth and animals and birds, be that lonely old man that takes pleasure in feeding the pigeons in the park every day.  Yes I can see myself with the overcoat and cap, sat with a paper and some bread
I cannot help but have regrets.  I know I cannot change the past.  I do not want much from life.  I just want to be loved.  I suppose as no one else is going to love me, I need to love myself.  But I just can’t do it 

I need help.  I cannot carry on like this.

When people leave,"Being left behind.....
... is a theme that's run through my life. Nearly everyone I've loved, has left me.
From boyfriends to best friends to my brother moving across the world to my Mother leaving our family home to marry another man and later becoming ill with Alzheimer's. I've never broken up a serious relationship. It's always been THEM that ended it. This includes my child's father who stopped all contact with me while I was pregnant, and has now moved to another continent. Perhaps I have abandonment issues. It wouldn't be surprising.
Anyway, on to this week.
Two D.S members on my friends list decided to take a break from the site this week.
One, I'm happy to report, has returned. The other, I think may never return.
I know people here are suffering and seeking support. I understand and respect the need to take a break or even leave for good if thats what's right for them. Or sometimes, for some lucky ones, their life improves and they decide to move on. I support them in whatever they feel is best.
What troubles me was my own reaction when a friend messaged to say he would be leaving for a while or perhaps for good. I was very emotional. Could be the wording of his message was reminiscent of a text message an ex boyfriend sent me when breaking up. But it really got to me! Now, a few days later, I feel ok with it. I just wasn't expecting to feel so attached to an online friend.
I just wanted to share this and to ask:
Has this happened to anyone else here?

Please Be Careful Lonely Ladies.....,"I hope that everyone had a wonderful weekend or at least tried to :). I just wanted to tell the ladies of this group to be careful with who they have discussions and email conversations with. I've had some issues with some men on this site that email me and end up being inappropriate. I have contacted the site and I do plan to contact the site owners as well about this because it has happened more than once. Some of the men on this site will seek out lonely and vulnerable females and email them trying to be friendly at first, or so they seem. After a few emails, they might get a bit possessive and somewhat controlling over the things you might tell them you are struggling with. One guy convinced me to use an outside chat service so that we could chat about our issues, then he ended up harassing me about sending him pictures of me, which of course I never sent. Another sicko pretended like he cared about my feelings but then became controlling and made comments on what I should and should not be doing with my ex, which of course is none of his damn business.
So I just wanted to warn other women to be careful. We are lonely and going through whatever may trouble us, so please know that there are predators and mentally deranged people that will try to take advantage of that. I find it sick and unnecessary. This is NOT a dating or sex website; I think DailyStrength needs to do better to make that clear. People come here for support and comfort, not to be judged or made to feel guilty over their life choices. I just find it sad that there are so many evil people out here that will stop at nothing to bring others down. I thought that this was a supportive community, but I guess not. It's very difficult finding any support these days, sickening even. The minute you say something that someone does not like or makes them uncomfortable, they think it is okay to attack you, and when you bite back, they want to play victim. No, not with me, not today!
I hope that everyone has a great week, and hang in there, it all gets better with time :).
God bless.",loneliness
New- hi,"I am generally a very happy person.
BUT....
I have been lonely my whole life.
We moved all the time. I was always in a new school and always the new girl.
I did have some friends as a young adult,but they were not very good for me, and for reasons I cant figure out, they decided to stay friends and shut me out.
Now I am older. I have no one to talk to, I also have DID (multiple personalities) which makes me feel weird like no one would want to be friends anyway. And I have to keep it a secret, which means I cant ever really let anyone get to know me.
I am a teacher on summer vacation, and the loneliness gets a lot worse when I dont see my colleagues every day.
AnywY... this all feels very awkward to write. Thanks for reading.",loneliness
is there anyone...,who wants to talk? Anybody out there? This lonliness is consuming me,loneliness
Loneliness and Holidays,"Hello everyone, I hope that you are all doing well this weekend. Do any of you feel lonelier on a holiday like today, Father's Day??? My own father is not in my life and has not been for years. He is not well mentally and I choose not to have that kind of chaos in my life. Since many of us do not have many friends or none at all, and may not even have much family, some of us may feel lonelier on days where you are supposed to be with family and friends. I have other family that I am not close to, so the only people I deal with daily are my mom and son. While I am thankful for my mom and especially my son, I still feel lonely. I'm not comfortable speaking to my mom about certain things and my son is only 2; he is my child, not my BFF. 
I knew that breaking up with my ex last year would cause me to feel more loneliness even though I was still lonely with him. I thought about calling him to see how he is doing, but he is still angry that I left him. I was just not willing to spend the rest of my life with a sociopath, so I had to walk away for my sanity, safety, and my own health. I think we all wish this feeling of loneliness did not exist, I know I do. No matter how many people you have in your life, you can still feel incredibly lonely. So every time I get lonelier and I want to contact my ex or someone else from my past, I remind myself of why I cut them out of my life to begin with. I remember that I deserve better and that I am worthy of being treated well, NOT being treated like trash in a landfill. I also remember that I have to be an example to my son. He is growing and developing and he does not need to see me with a revolving door of abusive bum losers. His safety and happiness are more important than my feelings!
So I just wanted to tell everyone to hang in there, it will get better eventually, but please remember to do what is best for you and your heart. Being miserable with someone to avoid being lonely or alone is just not worth it. I'll take being lonely over being in an unhealthy or dangerous situation with a POS any day of the week. 

Happy Father's Day to all the amazing fathers out there! 
God bless.

My birthday...,"My birthday was last Saturday. Because on Thursday was my brother's wedding, no one seemed to care enough to celebrate with me. They only remmebered when I told them, and no one went out of its way to cut one cake for me. ""MY FAMILY""... has anyone else felt that their friends are closer to them that their own blood relatives? I MEAN, how come that when I say that they didn't thought about me for 10 minutes, I AM SELFISH? I really feel as if they don't care about me the same amount I care about then, and is a very  lonley feeling, I am crazy?? I mean, the wedding was THURSDAY, and this SATURDAY. What's with that lame excuse? I am upset, because I don't feel validated. When is their birthday I am the first to congratulate them and to tell them to go out to celebrate. They either took relationships for granted or they don't care! BUT I DO! anyone has recommendations or  had simmilar experiences??? I don't want to feel like this! Like I am only convenient for when they need something! ",loneliness

Restless,"Hello
This is my first post. I wanted to get perspective on a situation.See if there are any solutions. I know I need to go out. My ex and father of my child is resentful of our separation even after many years have passed. He says and does hurtful irritating disrespectful things to antagonize me and I feel like other people share his opinion of me and I feel like I can’t form bonds with anyone because I’m nervous all the time and I keep crying at work and I feel really vaunerable and exposed at the school picking up our child because I worry about the humiliation he’s causing and weird rumours he spreads so we don’t really form bonds with people in our community because I don’t know how to make them understand they have the wrong impression because even if I explain which is difficult because I have low self esteem because of the constant subtle attacks over time have just worn me out. I’m afraid they will just see disfunction and be turned off or will pity us. I have been to many counciling sessions but I can never really be honest about what it’s doing to me because I’m afraid they will see me as unfit to care for our child even though they are independent and very smart. Or maybe that is just another scare tactic that isn’t true.  I love our child and I want our lives to be good in this community . I chose to live in a more expensive part of town to have a safer community but he just makes us feel bad that we can’t afford luxuries.He showers our child with expensive gifts and shows off things he buys on impulse, but our child is not in sports or camp for the summer and I can’t understand his actions. He is very social and has opportunities to bond with other family’s but won’t unless he ruins they’re opinion of me first or plays with my head until I sabotage it myself. He started seeing someone recently and I thought it would stop but now he just pays Less attention to our child and uses his relationship to make me feel bad about myself. I just want to go out and make new bonds but I feel like I can’t escape him. It is hard to not believe what he is saying and hard not to think that they will believe him over me because he tells everyone that I am making him suffer the the things he is guilty of doing to us. And I want out of this cycle while I’m still relatively youngish enough to have another family and marry someone else. I just don’t know how to start and I am afraid to be found out and be an object of gossip or have my child’s  friendships or social opportunities limited. Is that irrational? Any ideas on how to fight back? ",loneliness
Loneliness and Men's Opinions on Women's Bodies,"I hope everyone is doing well and coping well into the weekend. I had this thought that I have had over the past few months. Over the past year, I have met random men in passing and those that I have had general conversations with that think they have the right to comment on what a woman should be doing with her body or her life for that matter. So I'm wondering why these POS men think they have the right to tell a woman how she should make decisions involving contraception, abortion, pregnancy, body flaws, etc. The nerve, right???

For instance, I met this guy in the hospital that had the nerve to ask me if I use contraception, I didn't know him from Adam but he felt he could ask me that for whatever reason. Then I had a Lyft driver who was telling me about his problems and he felt that he still had a right to be concerned about who his ex wife is sleeping with even though they are divorced. And then another guy felt the need to tell me that I probably should not have a baby with my ex if we get back together since my ex is not perfect. So I'm trying to figure out if this is really America right now??? When did it become okay for men to insert themselves into the decisions women make on what we CHOOSE to do with our bodies??? When I was with my ex, he was very supportive on any reproductive decision that I made. He agreed that it was NOT his place to tell me if I should be using contraception, for example, that of which I do not use and will never use again. But he supported me and left it all up to me. That is rare with men today. My ex was not perfect, but at least he had the human decency to STFU about women's reproductive decisions!

Here is the thing. Everyone needs to worry about themselves, period. Men are out here having unprotected sex, spreading disease, and making babies they don't want and yet they feel like they can tell us how to make decisions about our reproductive organs. You have got to be kidding me! I think behavior like that causes some women to feel even more lonely and lost because they feel like no one really cares. Why do men do this??? How the hell is it a man's business what a woman decides to do with HER body when he can't even make good decisions on what to do with his??? WTF??? I'm just annoyed and appalled. But I will say this in closing: This is MY body and MY life and I will do as I please. If I choose to use contraception or not use it, or get an abortion or not get one, or have children or do not have them, it is MY right and MY decision, period. All of these POS men with opinions on our bodies need to f*ck off! Life is hard and lonely enough and then you have these lowlife men who think it is okay to tell us as women how to conduct ourselves or make reproductive decisions. FOH! Unreal!

What do you think, do the comments men make concerning a woman's body cause more isolation and frustration with women in general??? Enjoy the weekend!",loneliness
Dumbasses,"I chose to post this here because I think lonely people are more wise and intelligent than other types of people. And y'all may get a kick out of this.
My bf recently showed me a meme on his Facebook that said more money is spent on Viagra and boob jobs than science and research to beat Alzheimer's. So we will have lots of old people with big tits and hard dicks but they will have no idea why.
I laughed but also this is sad. It just shows how superficial and selfish people are. Alzheimer's is terrifying.

Help,Need someone to talk to. ,loneliness
Fear of Lonliness," I have never used this site, so let's see. I have an unreasonable fear of being left alone. I have friends that love me, and my brothers live in the same country as I do (they are all married), but I feel they have their own life and they choose their families over me, I mean, their wifes get jelous of me, so they have been putting a big distance between us lately.  My friends are good, but they also have their life and can't always respond to my needs (obviously). I miss my parents who are in my home country, and sometimes I suffer of panic attacks at nights thinking of being left behind and alone and worrying about being able to make it on my own. Is this normal for everyone? has anyone experienced these thoughts when departing their house? I know is a transitional phase because of becoming independent and adulthood, and blah, blah... but I am curious to know if anyone have had a simmilar experience they could relate? and what give you hope on the future and that everything is going to be fine?",loneliness
Working from home is really hard,"My office was downsizing and got rid of our office in December. Since then, I've been working from home. I get so many people that say how lucky I am to work from home and it has its perks for sure. But it is also really lonely. I don't see my co-workers that often. Even when I go to the gym or see people for happy hour, it seems like the the 20 hours of alone time is too much to make up in a 3 hour span where I am with friends. I even got a puppy a few months ago, and she's absolutely amazing. But when we go one walks and talk to people, it isn't anything substantial. Everyone acts like there is an easy solution to this, but there really isn't. Has anyone been in this situation? What were some things you did to aleviate the loneliness?",loneliness

Lonely in marriage," Been married 30 years and lonely and hurt by my husband... he’s a good guy however he is distant from me when I try to talk to him about things he said that hurt me he denies it and says I assume things and twist things around and turn makes me feel horrible. My kids are all grown and out of the house they come on once in while I try to act like we have an OK marriage but we do not I don’t know if I wanna leave because I might be more lonely but  the way he mskes me  feel (not all the time but most the time ) is extremely hurtful and we argue when try to talk  he is very moody as well.   Different days different personalities it’s almost like
 I take care myself emotionally and financially already I know I probably should separate but I’d like to make it work out I just don’t know how to approach him when he keeps on telling me that I twist things around and that’s not the way it is I just makes me feel very alone and sad. I don’t have a lot of friends around a lot of moved out of the area and no family to talk to you he on the other hand has family and lots of friends it’s almost like we live two separate lives are already
 Hope this makes sense I’m just kind of overwhelmed right now. 
Any advice on how to cope with this   so I appreciate

Does Racism Contribute to Loneliness???,"So everyone is talking about the whole Roseanne deal this week. Her show was recently canceled due to racist comments she made on Twitter and the backlash continues because her talent agency dropped her too. So it made me think. For those of us that are lonely and have experienced racism, do those experiences make loneliness worse??? I had a white professor in college that experienced racism when she took an African studies course when she was in college. The professor and classmates she had did not want her there because she was white. Even though I'm black, we actually connected when she spoke on it and she ended up being someone that I liked very much.
I once had a Hispanic male friend that I was involved with that treated me horribly. I ended our fake friendship last year and have not looked back. For some reason, he thought that blacks were beneath him and would say the cruelest things to me, I put up with it for too long and finally told him last year that I was done. Even though a lot of Hispanics are also black, some of them have a lot of hatred towards black people. I have no idea where those attitudes come from. I think a lot of racism begins at home. Racists more than likely have racist parents that taught them this behavior or in some cases racists are just hateful and hurting from something themselves. I brought up racism because I look back on my friendship with that guy and the wound still stings a bit. If he hated me or hated blacks so much, why the hell did he continue to try to be in my life, well we know why, but why sleep with me if my race bothers you??? WTH??? From that situation I learned that friends with benefits is a horrible idea because someone ends up getting hurt. After I cut ties with him, I did feel more lonely but I also felt relieved. He has since reached out, but I ignored and blocked him. I don't get why people are so damn cruel and evil. If you don't like someone, then move on and ignore them, but don't use them or be evil towards them for no reason. 
So I was just wondering how everyone else feels. I know racism is a sensitive topic for some, especially for those that have never experienced it, but it happens so much in the world today. Racism is wrong, period. And I think a lot of times it causes more isolation and loneliness in people because they never want to experience something so painful again. Thoughts???",loneliness
Feeling empty,"I feel like I cant breathe, and I cant help long for death, or a way out. Here is a little background about me. I am still studying at university, under my parents house (or I couldnt have a chance to get my degree which is one of my dreams btw), and I have a chronic illness which makes it hard for me to work, in other words I dont have money for myself, which is why I am still with my parents. And I am currently waiting for surgery to take out a huge cyst. And amogst this... my parents relationship is giving me so much anxiety. The anxiety is so severe that it makes me feel suicidal.
I cant help hate my father, and how he treats me mother. He verbally abuses her, calling her whore and bitch etc. And last night he physically hurt her, pulling her hair, taring her clothes and pushing her outside the house.
How can you love a man (even if its your father) who acts like such a monster? 
He makes up excuses, like stress from work and all. Oh that he diabetic and yet he is drinking alcohal. is having diabetes even a good validation to act so cruel and brutal? when he is the one drinking alcohal...
He has done things like this to me, not as severe as my mom, but he has literally called me ""nothing and Im a piece of shit"" because he has to always be right. When I was a teenager, he literally took my phone and smashed it right infront of me... How can I even call this man my father?? He is the kinda person that knows everything and doesnt care. As he says to me and my mom, every day ""I dont care"" as if we are nothing. And he complains ""Im depressed"" over nothing... its like he is making himself miserable and everyone around him is being punished for his misery. And my mom is the main target.
I had to finally voice out my feelings to my mom after last nights incident. As this was not the first time this has happened where he literally pushed her out the door, and I am so scared, so awfully scared for my life. And She has this mentality ""No, we cant leave him, we have to protect your dad! dont disrespect him""
are you kidding me?
BUT LOOK AT HOW HE IS TREATING YOU and she is enabling it.  then who will protect her from him? And she looks at me like im her fcking solution. I really cant handle this shit.. it makes me want to find any kind of escape, that id even opt for suicide. 
Why me? why me? why me? And My anxiety is screaming at me that no one cares about my pain. My struggle with my own illness, why do I HAVE TO take care of them? when I have always felt so emotionally isolated and they (my family) seems to bullying me into silence. I feel so empty, I feel weak and helpless and the thoughts of death seems like a tempting light out of the darkness of this house that I have become to loathe.  
And my mom is begging me to love him, BUT HOW CAN I?? i just hate him so much. I cant even understand why she loves this monster. how can anyone love such a monster? :(
I constantly feel sick being at home. You just dont know when my dad will snap and become violent.

Why Do Men Prey on Vulnerable and Lonely Women????,"I hope that everyone is doing well. I know that some people tend to get more lonely around a holiday because holidays are often meant to spend with family and friends. Memorial Day is tomorrow, so some of us might feel more lonely than others that have more support. Which brings to mind my issue today.
I often wonder why sick men prey on vulnerable women like single moms, disabled and handicapped women, women with less income, elderly women, etc. Recently I met this paramedic when my son was in the hospital for a fall. This dude basically begged for my number and I kind of gave in and gave it to him. When we first met, he seemed nice. We talked for a bit and I told him that I was single raising my son alone. Since then, we have talked, but something is off with this guy. Sometimes I barely hear from him and when I do, he never asks about my son, which is a red flag for me. When I met him, I told him that I have nothing to offer him because I am not interested in dating or anything else right now. He said he was cool with us just communicatig and getting to know each other through the phone. We have talked about dating even though I am not ready. This fool said he would rather do a ""meet and great"" first and then go on a date where he won't have to pay much. Who speaks like that??? Am I missing something??? Why in the hell do broke men chase women if they can't afford to date or provide for a woman??? This is the kind of behavior that I don't get. Most men do not want marriage and afmily, which is fine, but why do they prey on women that are lonely and vulnerable??? Why not just be by yourself instead of trying to find someone to use or waste time with???
I know men and women are different, but I get tired of bums hitting on me thinking that they will get something out of me. Yes, I am painfully lonely, but I'm no longer willing to be a fool just to have someone. I got tired of being used. It is NOT my responsibility to house, clothe, feed, or screw a bum when his dick decides to work. It just makes me sick how men target certain types of women. Everyone is not mentally ill, so these lowlife men cannot use that excuse. I realize I'm a woman and I will get hit on, but damn, I am sick and tired lowlife users. I guess I have to just keep saying no and moving on with my life. I live in a state with lots of racism, bums, and some of the worst people imaginable. Eventually I hope to move somewhere else.

I hope that you are all feeling okay. Have a safe Memorial Day.",loneliness
Missing contact with family and friends,"Several weeks ago I was diagnosed with a low immune system, CMV viral infection and glandular fever. I have been very sick and because I'm infectious I don't want my family or friends to catch anything from me. I moved into the spare room so as not to put my partner at risk. We've been scrupulous with hygiene. I'm exhausted with very little energy. Some days I can't even manage a shower. My partner is at work during the day. It looks like its going to take at least another month or two to recuperate. My doctor has advised lots of rest and no stress. I am a teacher and I am missing being at school with my young students. I am missing my family and friends and feel lonely during the day. Any feedback on shared experiences with CMV virus or glandular fever or advise would be grately appreciated. ",loneliness

I have no one to talk to and nobody I can be honest with. I don’t have any friends and can’t tell my family about how I feel. I’m so angry all the time and worried to the point of not being able to sleep most nights now I don’t know why I’m like this everyday. I’m starting to feel like there’s no point in me anymore. I don’t want to wake up the next day.
I’ve become dependant on him in the relationship, he wanted a few days apart for space because of how we have been and I can’t get through the first one without it making me worry and stress thinking he’s with someone else because of what’s happened before and how closed off he is compared to what he was.

I told four other friends something big that I neede their support on. Two didn't believe me, and that made me feel abandoned. The other two believe me, but haven't really talked to me, even though I have reached out to them.

I am 33 born and raised in london. My parents are from india, currently I work in netherlands/germany

people dont call me, when I was in high school people called me because they knew I had a bit of cash from my parents, but didnt really call me for a genuine friendship
my parents would argue alot and they didnt even make friends with the other parents. I had never been abroad on a summer holiday not even to india, and all the other kids had stories. fast forward to hugh school and I finally got to go abroad to indai but not mwith my family, just my mum and cousin and aunt. My mum and aunt would fight a lot so I didnt enjoy it at all. All I had was stress, and on top of this evenry time I left the house to see fake friemds my dad would say something to make me angry and I would leave stressed and under pressure. I did alot of substance abuse but I didnt enjoy it and when my parents ound out they thought I enjoyed it but tthey didt realise it was because of them. I was very concerned about my mum because all she would do is argue with her siblings and my dad, but argue to tell them something was wrong,, eventually she became silent,, and got early dementia and from the age of 50 - 60 the family looked after her and she passed away in 2017. 
I had no real friends, I had some friends from unoversity but they never called me, it was very 1 sided I would call them and meet them and go for a drink and this was how it was for along time. everyone at university already knew each other from their ownhigh schol or college. I had no loyal friends and i was very stressed looking after my mum, dealing with my dad, and seeing how everyone is having fun except for me, and trying make friends hoping somone will call me, and then give in and call them and take abuse.  e.g they anted me to drive but i would not ,, but this added to stre stress and i woulf just drink more,, and I believe they could all see a weakness in me that i have no social power so they could just treat me like shit. 

i had may jobs, and now i am abroad and it the same thing,, i met coleagues but they dont call me, partly becuase i am too serious and they have made their mind up that i am not worth calling. I am serious because my mum died. 

I have missed out many details, buy this is my firs post. It is very stressful being alone, i force my self to think a certain way then i feel my brain being flooded with chemicals and then i tell myself this is normal, and thats how i get by.  I do call and whats app coleagues sometimes but they dont answer or they have blocked me.  I havent told them my mum died and i am sad. 
nothing makes any sense. I just want someone to call me and not in a cunning way to convience me to go somewhere i dont want to go or do something i dont want to do, or just to arrange something properley not where I am the last person they called and I walk to the place and everyone is already there and having fun and they all know each other except for me. 

this is my frost post and there are a lor of detail i missed. my dr say i may be autistic and i havent had enough fun in my life.
i cant go though life initiating freidnship and calling people and nobody calls me. 
I am also not on social media

Why do I feel lonely?,"I just started to feel a sense of ""loneliness"" in the last year. I don't understand why I feel like this though... I know that all my friends and family love and care for me so much, but I still can't help but feeling cast aside and unwanted. Does anyone know why this happens? Is there a way around it?",loneliness
When will this end?,"I've been heartbroken. Very heartbroken. I only feel safe posting this here.

I started to like a guy at my job beginning of March 2018. I knew at that time he was leaving to go back home 800 miles away. Nonetheless, I reached out to him and finally admitted my feelings which he admitted his. I really felt something for him. I really liked him, he fit every category for me. Attractive, good hygeine, dark hair, slender, great smile, masculine voice, seemingly good life, didn't smoke, didn't overly drink, had his own apartment, went to work. We talked on the phone for hours, texted a little bit (he was terrible at texting) and hungout 3 times, kissed the last 2 times. The last time we kissed it lasted 2 hours since he was leaving the next day. I knew I didn't want to let go. I wanted him. He knew it. But he didn't want a relationship.

All I can think about is wishing things were different enough that we could be together. But that just won't happen. He's too ignorant. And it hurts. I want someone i can't have and it's killing me. I haven't seen him in about a month and I just can't stand it. When will this obsessiveness end? I feel like I won't ever move on and feel the same for another person. But i want nothing more than that. I just want to be happy, but I can't stop this unnecessary attachment to someone who doesn't want me...",loneliness
On Loneliness and Being a Friend,"I spend a lot of time alone.  Most of it is bedbound or at least housebound.  Most of that time is spent on the basics of self-care (toileting, eating etc) and the extra sleep/rest my primary medical condition requires.  Thankfully, I do have service providers that come to my home a few hours daily.  When I am out and about, it is usually for my own or my son's appointments or for household errands that my home health personal care assistsnt has not fit into her schedule.
It really doesn't matter how many people are around me, though, or how busy or not, I am... my loneliness is a direct reflection of the degree to which I am feeling heard and understood at any given time.  I realize, however, my ""feeling"" is dependent upon my own attitude and actions as much as others'.  Sometimes this is hard to accept because I am already so thoroughly exhausted by other aspects of living. I don't want to put forth the time and energy to evaluate the validity of my thoughts, to improve the clarity of my communication, or to bridge gaps.  However, if I leave my loneliness too much in the control of others, I disempower myself and let the demons of depression take hold.  For me, that is dangerous because they are bent on destroying me.  At the same time, I must honor my right to have reasonable expectations of others and my right to feel and express emotions like disappointment.
I have a hard time offering to be a friend because I'm afraid of letting people down.  I can disappear for months at a time when I become very ill. When my condition worsens, it is sudden and the only remedy is sleep.  Oddly, though, even when I am absent for long stretches, it is my online friends who usually show the most interest and empathy.  That said, I'm happy to be a ""friend"" to any here but be aware my time and energy are limited, it is nothing personal if I disappear for awhile, I cannot be succinct for multiple medical reasons, and I am on the Autism Spectrum.  The latter means I tend to be straightforward and genuinely emotionally empathetic. At the same time, I may be unintentionally invasive or forthright and I may not understand what is not stated in an obvious way.  My defaults are not those of most but they are no worse or better.",loneliness

Painfully Lonely.......,"How is everyone??? I haven't posted since last year so I just thought I would stop by to see how everyone is doing. I was feeling increasingly lonely tonight and just wanted to post. I cut the toxic people out of my life last year for good reasons, and I have felt more lonely, but still glad I decided to do what was best for me. Honestly, I've been lonely my whole life even though I had parents, a sibling, other family members, friends, and now my own little boy :). However, even when I have had friends or boyfriends, I still feel incredibly lonely. Is there anyone else that feels this way too??? 
Becoming a mum did not help my loneliness at all. Even though I'm introverted, I do want love, but I am no longer willing to settle for being treated like cheap trash, so I have decided to just be single and try to embrace it. I made a vow to myself last year to never settle again for someone not worth my time that does not deserve me. I do NOT regret leaving my ex, he is a married sociopath and I had to leave for my own sanity and safety, plus I was still lonely while I was with him. However, I struggle with opening my heart up to love again. I'm tired of being used and tired of settling for POS loser men. Why do so many people lie and use others??? Why waste someone's time if all you want to do is use them for sex or money or a place to sleep/live??? Can anyone else relate?? Even if you can't, I wish everyone peace and a great weekend.

Alone Forever,"I'm back after a long leave.  Nothing has changed since I was last here.  The lonliness still exists, I guess everyone has forgot about me.  No one but one friend will call or text.  He may only call or text once a month at that.  Even my social media doesn't get much attention.  I have been in a funk for about a month.  I hate my job as it is very physical and it wears me out fast.  I hate it and can't seem to find one with equal pay or close to it.  It sucks that I cant lean on a friend to talk about this.  I am coming to the conclusion that it is just me alone for the rest of my life.  Even relationships are nonexistant.  ",loneliness

"In a house full of people, yet completely alone","My mind has me trapped really bad! I live in a small one bedroom apartment with my mother, grandmother, two male cousins and myself.

I am losing sight of what is most important to me, which is getting my daughters back. I feel defeated in every way possible. I am doing things I wouldnt normally have done, but since the split with my abusive ex and the removal of my daughters I am not handling things well. I have mentally been suffering ever since my papa died almost two years ago now. Having to watch my grandmother suffer so much is really taking a toll on me, just seeing their relationship and how close they were. They were each other best friends and he had been in my life for like 23 years. He watched me grow up and as I look at myself in the mirror each day I know my papa would be so disappointed. I fucked up! I just want to fix it and get back right and make my family and my daughters proud of me. I just feel so alone, all the time. There was a point in my life where I was afraid to be alone. I couldn't stand the feeling and def couldn't bare the thought of me being alone but ever since leaving my ex I thought I had tackled my worst fear.

I'm so lonely and sad,"I went to a class/group therapy for vets with PTSD at the VA (I'm a veteran), and I had a tough time during class bc of the topic that was being discussed (radical acceptance) and I spoke and said that i am unable to accept the things that have happened to me in my life, bc the one living relative i have left in the world (my father) is not a good person and i am better off not speaking to him and being far away from him, so i dont speak to him, and i'm several states away. The bad thing is that i have no other living relatives left anywhere in the world, my mother died when i was 2 months old and i have no memory of her, her parents raised me and were the last people that trulu loved me and took care of me and showed interest in my life and wanted me to be happy and showed me that they loved me. They died when i was 13 and 14. I am 37 now. I went to go ive with me father and stepmother when i was 15 and lived with those people for 5 years and it was absolutely awful, when i was 20 i took all my stuff and left, and i've been all alone in the world ever since. This sucks and i hate it. I dont even have any friends in this city I live in, because of bad experiences with friends taking advantage of my kindness. with mother's day being tomorrow, I'm very very sad bc I never got to know my mom and ill never be able to, and my grandparents are dead too. I had hoped with all my heart that by now I'd be married and have children of my own, but apparently i have too many issues for anyone to want to deal with or for anyone to want to put up with me. I dont know what the problem is. My one hope for my life to get and feel better since I was 13 has been that someday I'll meet someone that can love me and want to share life with me and someday we'll get married and have a baby or two, and at least after being married then i'd be a part of a family again, even if were just the two of us; or if I had a long term serious boyfriend then i'd have someone to be there for me that I can love and I can be there for him, and I'd feel like i was a part of this thing called life. Right now I feel like I'm some kind of outcast of society bc everyone has plans this weekend or something to do on Sunday, and i've tried trying to talk to people I know, by texting or messaging and saying that i could really use someone to talk to, but since Thursday, when i went to the VA and started trying to find someone to talk to, no one at all has responded to me, and that just really really hurts. I feel like I dont matter as a human being and like I have no life, and I'll probably never have a life bc i'm 37 now and in a few short years I'll have to start keeping in mind that it will get less likely ill get to have children, and I'm just really sad and upset about all of this. also, everywhere i go there are things advertising mother's day, even on TV, or they advertize something related to babies and motherhood, and it just breaks my heart and i want to start crying bc I'm afraid I'll never find someone that wants to be with me and stay with me, and that also wants children or more children.",loneliness

The kids at church only talk to her most of the time and will barely acknowledge me. At the most they’ll make a little eye contact with me then keep talking to my sister as if I’m not even there. My family says it’s because they know her better and that I could talk to them more. I think they could at least acknowledge me. Social skills are not easy for me my family could at least keep that in mind. From what I described with the church kids dose this sound like exclusion. ,loneliness

To this day, I'm not sure what that ""something"" is, but I have a strong feeling I'll never see her again. I haven't seen her in a few years now.

She knows I like her, she turned me down once, and right now is dating someone and has a child, though not with her guy. I have strong feelings about her, and I know I shouldn't. I can't have her. But I can't stop thinking about her or dreaming of what could have been. It's too much of a coincidence for us to keep reuniting like this.

A Poem...,"You say that I’m broken and I’m not fit to your standards.That strength and confidence are what you require and I’m doomed to but only gander.And because I’m scrawny and lacking in fortitudeI’m exempt from love and romance, maybe should go sub...for dudes.If only life were that simple and orientation were a choice.I would have given up on women and fallen for boys.But I’m straight and nothing can change me no matter what a fundamentalist wants to say.I’ve dealt with so much pain and hurt from the opposite sex that I wish I could choose to be gay.It’s not only those I’ve longed for who have seeded this heartbreak.But from toxicity and a troubled family, even my mother said I was a mistake.Dead serious, said if she knew she were carrying at the time she would have aborted.You look at me as if my issues are something in spite of that can easily be thwarted.School was never a time meant for learning, fun, or social delight.Everyday paranoia gripped me, sending me into panic attacks and fright.Beatings occurred regularly, no help was given.Was told to just man up, stop whining, and take it as competition.It hurt so bad, being stabbed on the bus with that pencil.I was hit in the face so much it’s a wonder how I never needed dental.Just go out kid, have fun with the others.Why can’t you be more like those inspirations on TV, or even your grandma’s brothers.One of which was a fat slob who just happened to marry into someone rich.No idea what she sees in him, as he gave me a concussion on my 10th birthday like a little bitch.He’d tell me grow a spine and face my fears.Funny how the guy who throws his blind dog down a flight of steps is telling me how a real man volunteers.After a move and a new beginning.I thought to myself, maybe, just maybe I can start winning.I embraced my new environment, the school was much smaller.Even made a new friend named Ryan, and he was somewhat taller.Over a healthy few months we grew close.We went to movies, parties, and even played San Andreas, boy that made him engrossed.He got so excited his eyes would nearly pop from his head.But my grandma who had custody of me all of a sudden could hardly get up from bed.I was 15 when she died, Leukemia took her fast.But not before she told me to my face softly that she would live forever, just 2 weeks before she passed.My biological mom swooped in and usurped me from my new home.I had no say in the matter, much like the slaves of Rome.My old man fought tooth and nail to get me back.Eventually succeeding, and having to face the horror of my old school I eventually needed prozac.I begged to see my friends, how much I missed them.But my old man held grudges towards my family and it was his decision to condemn.One year went by and I lost my shit.Stormed into the principal's office, said enough was enough and on his face I spit.My actions resulted in a school transfer.They put me in a classroom which required chauffeur.The teacher was out of touch as they always are, our first day prompted debate on video games.Of course my arguments in favor of them fell on deaf ears, she was old and lame.This fatass bitch next to me in class kept giving me dirty looks.My anger was hard to contain, but I forced my face back to my books.This was my only chance to get away from that old school.If I lashed out this time, I’d likely need to go back and I look like a fool.Not long after a new student arrived.Lets call her Alice, her real name now brings heartbreak to mind.Alice was an artist, a beautiful one at that.But the nature of our class pointed to demons inside her, which she confided with some chit chat.Initially she took a liking to me, it was clear. How she’d sometimes look in my direction smiling ear to ear.I found we shared many interests, lots of nerdy ties.From a love for anime, metal music, video games, and even that Nostalgia Critic guy.We got along so well she one day drew my face on construction paper.The detail and effort made my self worth grow several acres.Sadly there wasn’t much to be taken from it.As her heart was soon swooned by some musclehead degenerate piece of shit.Initially I was supportive, easing into a friendly role.But as time went on I saw the suffering in her eyes as I soon found he tore a hole in her soul.Every morning before class, I’d be her shoulder to cry on.Telling me about how this guy put her down, threaten to tear up her artwork, and manipulated her through his brawn.Everyday a piece of me broke as she went on with her stories, even got to the point where I got her number and she’d tell me dusk to dawn.How this assclown thought it would be a sweet trick.To prank you into eating meat knowing you’re a vegetarian and laughing when you wound up sick.Then one weekend this prick takes her virginity. Only to break up with her two days later and be all giggity giggity giggity, on to my next titty.My heart sank, and my depression worsened.Because not long after I witnessed her cut herself in class just to get the attention of this person.For weeks she was gone, but I still called her.Confessed my feelings eventually, but she did not concur.I was too quiet in class and told too many bad jokes.Of course she gives the dickhead a second chance, why not folks.Confusion swarmed my thoughts, wondering why oh why.Would she rather a neglectful douchenozzle like that and not me, a nice guy.One day I caught up to her and spoke my mind.She called him a ‘kicked puppy’, and that she could mend him to turn kind.I reiterate how much I confided in her during out private talks.How I myself was kicked so much and that he can’t stop bragging how good she sucked his cock.That if anyone needed mending from a troubled past it was me.She responded I have standards don’t you see.The way you look and speak, not to mention all those bad jokes are not up my alley.Did she really just turn me down because I didn’t win some genetic lottery.I said Alice I just don’t understand.How me telling bad jokes is so much more horrible than the mistreatment from that sad excuse of a man.She rolled her eyes and through some forced smile said ‘sorry hun’.You say you have standards but in actuality you have none.I walked away in disgust and hoped I could one day find peace.Did I mention this delusional chick’s favorite film was Beauty and the Beast.I pulled out the construction paper she drew me on when I got home, tearing it to pieces.Flushing it down the toilet to clump with everyone’s feces.Not long after that she transferred.Leaving me a broken man and searching for real answers.Through lengthy consideration my conclusion was made.She only dated him to have an excuse to indulge her blade.I looked at her facebook one last time to say goodbye.And laughed when I read her then-boyfriend cheated on her, sigh sigh sigh.Not sure if we would have worked out.But she wouldn’t have had to worry about that with me, there’s no doubt.I wiped my hands of her then, seeing she was broken.If she truly wanted to find actual love, I’d have been that opportune token.One year later I graduated High School.And for four long years, I was my old man’s tool.As he aged I needed to be constantly close.For if I left for even a moment, I might have came home to discover him on the floor comatose.I lived a sheltered life for his sake, it was a path I myself chose.Because no one else would have done it, they had their own lives to blow.At the time I was unaware my life would have meaning.Outside of caring for my old man, his mental illness quickly peaking.The initial years were alright.Just me and him against the world to fight.But as time went on and his mind began to go.I found myself abused, berated, and without anything else to know.My years in school were wasted as it was a fight for survival.Those who raised me sheltered me from a normal life and my thoughts became suicidal.For years I was told I would amount to nothing.That I needed daddy because he’d say face it, whatever you do you’ll just screw it up and end up sucking.In that environment my mind conformed.To see no value in myself, but somehow I weathered the storm.As he deteriorated and began falling.I was left to pick up the pieces all alone as my heart went on bawling.My time was often spent on the internet.Trying to distract myself from the pain indulging in pornography and blasting metal on my headset.Not long after I picked up writing.Found I had a knack for it and it was so exciting.Through my new hobby new friends reached out.One from Canada I may not be alive today without.Eventually my old man’s health became too unstable.Had to put him in a nursing home and all of a sudden I was alone...but not unable.Through services designated to help me.I got my own place and finally felt free.A whole new life began and didn’t know what to decide.But as I made serious plans, my old man up and died.The blow was great as he was the only person I felt loved me.Felt alone and isolated, but my friends online became my new family tree.As time went on and I was free to discover myself.With no overbearing old man to brainwash me or saying ‘you no good bastard, go fuck yourself’.It took a long time but as I recovered.I got a rabbit on a whim, treated him like a little brother.I always wanted one as a kid but my family always said no.It’ll die in a month, kid, trust us we know.I was still of this mindset, but decided to give it a shot.Low and behold a year later it’s still alive and happy, guess my family should get taught.Through this experience I saw in this area I was strong.Gee, I wonder what else my family got wrong.With a nudge from a peer, I established credit.And a year later my score passed 700, my family’s truly pathetic.I saw how much responsibility I had in these places.I’ve grown more in the first 3 years without my toxic family, fuck being in their good graces.Through trials and tribulations my heart became strong.The problem was with people who can only see strength skin deep, to them I say so long.During all this I learned something that hit me like a ton.My friend Ryan from high school committed first degree murder, intentional hit and run.I tried amending ties with my mom.Her anger management and toxic problems did nothing to make me calm.On facebook right before Christmas it all came to a head.Where she lost her shit again and brought up aborting me, pretty much saying I should be dead.I kept my cool and let her vent her lies.Oh, did I mention this was all over chicken fries.As I went up to my apartment after she dropped me off.I waited a few hours till she got home and over facebook blocked her, telling her enough was enough.That she wasn’t a good mother and was deluded.It takes more than just a roof over a child’s head and food on the table to prevent their mind from becoming polluted.But she had to have the last word and try manipulating me and going behind my back.My autistic brother’s facebook account she hacked.She chewed me out calling me disrespectful and rude.Bitch look in the mirror, invasion of privacy can get you sued.That was the last I heard of her, as she blocked my brother from contacting me ‘cause to her I was mean.Unfortunately for her he secretly hates her and will soon turn 18.So right now I’ll just kick back and wait.My life is finally on track and I’m still looking for that first date.Yes I’m still a virgin and I was cucked.But in a way it helped me, as I’m not the one being fucked.If I had been popular and gotten laid.I may be in deep with a family I can’t support and not have the time to see how my future could be made.Looking back on what happened and seeing myself now.I can see my strengths for what they are and I make up for so much, unlike Alice the broken and the jock degenerate cow.That I lived through a life of isolation and hurt yet I’m still here.No substance abuse or self harm on my part I think speaks a lot of how strong I am, and that thought at times makes me wipe a tear.Unfortunately not everyone sees it that way.Wanting to conform to norms and shun those who stray.But I’ve learned in life that people will find some reason to hate you no matter the circumstance.I’ll be myself, and tell you to kiss the taint of my underpants.",loneliness
Very blah today with no one to talk too,"I feel so isolated and alone, I’m am trying desperately to heal after a relationship with a psychopath I have basically lost all of my friends and almost lost my only family member left my brother who is really sick himself and I can’t even bring up that I’m depressed because he is dealing with Health issues and he gets really upset if I bring up my ex, he gets mad and says mean things and I relive trauma all over again
No one can understand what it’s like unless you have gone threw it but it makes me feel so isolated and lonely and depressed so bad that I cry daily today I was better in the beginning of the day but slowly slipped down, I do suffer from ptsd from that relationship, what really kills me is that I’m left here in this darkness that is so deep sometimes I feel as though I will never get out and he is just living his life being happy life is so unfair, what keeps me going is that psychopaths can not change do to their faulty wiring in their brain no conscience, no guilt, no empathy and so on...  I have a lot of shame and guilt it’s all do to the abuse he did to me mentally and physically.... I have to do anything it takes to stop being obsessed with him even though that’s exactly what he wants... 
everything I have read about these “people” is that it’s normal for me to have these feelings of repulsion to longing because of the trauma bond that they purposely set out to hook you into their sick web of illusion and betrayal and abuse
I do see a therapist every week... i have to find that inner strength that I know is in there it’s just buried so far down that at times I don’t know if I can ever reach it but then I say he has destroyed me in every way I have to save myself this time, I have no other choice if I want to live
Thank u for letting me vent, I just want everyone who feels alone you are not alone their are a lot of us here with you, I send my love to all of you and I hope you feel better soon...",loneliness

I am 19 years old and i'm still in college trying to find my way through life, yet I can't seem to get over the fact that I don't have that backbone in my life and that I am truly on my own. And there always are constant reminders of it from those around me who go home to their families for the weekends and have their parents call to ask how they are. I feel like no one really understands how I feel, or they give me sympathy which isn't what I want.

Back to square one.,"About 5 years ago, I met someone here on DS and it lead to a wonderful relationship for a few years. Then we had a child together which ended up slowly driving us apart and lead her to take our son to go live with another man and leaving me all alone. I'm now back to where I started; single, living with a family member in the country, no friends, no significant other, and feeling very frustrated with what I thought was the end of my loneliness is now back worse than ever. It truly hurts more to have loved and lost then never loved at all, at least you don't know what you're missing if you never felt it before.",loneliness

Confusedly Blinded,"My life was great, happy, moving ahead
So why now do I have these thoughts in my head?
What happened here along the way?
Was it the way you appeared? What is what you would say?
Wrong, ashamed, sinner.
You're on my mind; can be catastrophic, tornadic, bitter. 
Why are you in my head? You shouldn't be here.
I have someone else that needs me. Been with him 6 damn years.
No worries. Once you leave from this state, you will soon fade.

Need some help,"I think I want unrealistic things, but people tell me I need to have standards, and not to lower them. But my standards for a romantic partner seem to be unatainable, either because the particular combination I'm looking for outright doesn't exist in the local population where I live, or that the combination I'm looking for does exist, but, because other men are also not blind or stupid, those women are already taken. Dating apps are basically useless because they lock all the good search features behind a paywall. That, or I'm just ugly and they all swipe left before even looking at my profile. I don't want to look for women that are below my standards, but I'm getting increasingly close to tearing all of my hair out over how much I see posts on Facebook and the like from girls I like that say things along the lines of ""uggh need a guy that will treat me right/respect me/not cheat, etc."" and I'm like ""THAT IS ME YOU FUCKING OBLIVIOUS WOMEN!"" I want to find soemone. I want marriage, kids. I want my happy ending, a happily ever after. And I deserve to find someone that I find attractive, physically, mentally, intellectually, and emotionally. I shouldn't have to compromise just because I believe the women who describe themselves as ""curvy"" are not, in fact, ""curvy"", and that ""everyone is beautiful in their own way"". That is objectively false. I wish there was a dating app that would pool together all the people that say they find you attractive so you can vet them without having to guess if they'll like you back, or there should be a dating app that doesn't use pictures, so people only have a profile to go off of. Or a dating app that allowed you to designate dealbreakers so you won't be shown people who answer a certain way to your particular dealbreakers.",loneliness

Nobody,"I feel so alone. And I feel like I did it to myself. I'm an introverted person in the first place, so I'm good with just having a few close friends. I drove away one of those friends last year because I didn't feel like it was a healthy friendship, though I feel awful for allowing things to end the way they did. Then, I graduated a semester early because I thought that would help with my overall health by eliminating the pressure of high school, but I miss the few friends I did have. I'll see them for maybe a few hours one day during their winter break or spring break, but then they go right back to their actual friends. When I'm with them, they give me a look of pity. When I text them, they don't always text back and I feel bad for bothering them. They go to things and don't invite me - things that I wouldn't necessarily want to go to, but it would've been nice to be invited. 
Then, my family. My brother lives far away and doesn't reply when I reach out to him always, so I feel badly for bothering him. My sister has a newborn baby and is so so busy. My brother-in-law shares different beliefs than me, which is perfectly okay, but he's starting to rub it in my face, and I feel like our relationship is falling apart because of it. I've been struggling with a few things mental-healthwise that have unfortunately made my parents very cautious when they approach me. In fact, I hardly speak to my dad even though we live in the same house. 
I find that whenever I'm ""daydreaming,"" I have friends around me. I'm talking and laughing and I have a best friend who actually knows me and understands me. I know the obvious answer is to ""get out there, go make friends!"" but it's not that easy. 
I've struggled with an ED since I was super young, making my weight ""yo yo"" and I just so happen to be the heaviest I've ever been right now. It doesn't help with the social anxiety of it all - I HATE going out, hate seeing what I look like in ""nice clothes"" in my heavy body, every piece of it is terrifying. 
Another obvious answer may be ""go see a therapist, try some medicine."" I've tried it all. I was on medicine for such a long time that I stopped worrying all together, started failing school, feeling cloudy all the time. I've tried different medicines since, all with different, scary side effects. I've tried 3 different therapists, each one making me reach deep into my childhood trying to pin point what is ""wrong"" with me, with my family. It's driven me away from my parents and I hate it. I'm at a loss of what to do.",loneliness

I have suggested to do things and go places, but they don't go because one they feel as though that's an exciting thing to do and only wants to do it with their significant other, and two doesn't make time at all.

It’s supposed to be one of the most exciting times of my life and it’s been the worst... the main I’ve been in love with who I thought I was spending the rest of my life with has been acting like a completely different person since we found out.. all he kept talking about is how bad he wanted a baby and couldn’t wait until we started a family and now that we have, he is never here anymore. He’s constantly out drinking with his friends. He claims to be going to the gym at 1 in the afternoon then doesn’t come home until after 3 or 4 in the morning or he’s “working” and it turns into a 2 hour job to him being gone for 12+ hours.. We used to go on trips together all the time and now he doesn’t even ask me or invite me and makes all these plans with “his guy friends.” We don’t even have conversations anymore. I try to go to dinner with him and he sits on his stupid phone and texts “the guys” or scrolls through Facebook the whole time. I even took him to a movie and he didn’t even know what was going on because he wouldn’t get off his phone the whole time.. I quit my job, left all of my old friends, even moved away from my hometown and my mom for this guy and now I’m scared. I’m terrified. Our house is in his name.

The Loneliness Epidemic,"6452 members of the Loneliness support group - I hope some of you are communicating more frequently via the messaging service on DS? To be honest, I'm not. Maybe it's pride, I dunno.
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of lonely people out there in the world. Is there a way to break through barriers in a non-threatening way to let them know you're friendly (they don't have to befriend you or anything) and available to chat, should they need it (in a safe setting)? I'm assuming that loneliness has reached epidemic proportions in the West, at least, but I could be wrong.

I need someone to slap some sense into me and yell,"I am and always have been in love with my best friend. Over the summer we decided to stay friends because he lives really far away and we barely have time to talk to one another. For a few months now I have been seeing an ex of mine who used to be emotionally abusive but has since changed thanks to therapy and his group of friends giving him an intervention. 
Recently my ex made it Facebook Offical that we were dating and at first it didnt bother me until I sat down and really thought about it. These past few months it hasnt felt like a relationship, its been more like friends with benefits. When my best friend saw the post he wished me luck, hoped my ex wouldnt be the same as he was before and told me he couldn't wait for me any longer.
This hit me so hard I cried for hours and havent slept well for days. I never realized how much I loved him but now I feel like its too late. And even if I went to my best friend and told him I wanted to be with him I scared it wont last because he lives states away and even though we keep in touch it doesnt always feel like enough for me.
My depression and anxiety make me feel like I need someone to be there so that I can find peace. I feel like I'm just being weak and stupid for going back to my ex. I feel like my heart is crumbling into pieces and I'm the only one to blame. I feel like it's too late to change any of this.",loneliness

The genie looks at the three guys and says: ""I normally give three wishes, but since there are three of you, I will grant each of you one wish.""Well, the first guy is sick and tired of being on the island, so he wishes to go back home. POOF!!! He disappears. The second one said he, too, is tired of the island, and wishes to go home. POOF!!! He too disappears.

40 and Friendless,"I feel ridiculous writing this.  I have friends.  But I don't have any that I feel particularly close to.  I had a ""best"" friend for several years.  Spoke everyday.  She was just as concerned about my life as I was about hers.  Or so I thought.  But then we grew apart after she went through a rough couple of years and I guess I didn't provide the attention and support that she needed.  She cared absolutely nothing about what was going on in my life.  It felt pretty toxic, so I gradually backed away as did she.  We text occasionally but anytime recently we've tried to get together, she's ditched me.  And so now I find myself without anyone I hear from daily.  If I talk to friends it's because I reach out to them to see how they are doing.  It hit me today that no one ever reaches out to me.  Feeling sorry for myself I guess.  I'm happily married with kids and have no reason to be down, but I am.

Long term social isolation,"Hello, 
As the title suggests, I have a serious, long term, multi-faceted problem with lack of social interaction. Multiple serious betrayals of my trust as a child have since made it near impossible for me to form friends or even interact casually with other people beyond required interaction for work or school. Logically, I see my problem as thus: all people are innately capable of betrayal of trust, and given the right circumstance, it is inevitable. Therefore, I have lacked the ability and desire to make friends for many years. I'm extremely lonely and my isolation only leads to more time for me to process and reaffirm my own logic. It's at the point where I have nothing to look forward to in my life and not a single person I can reach out to for any kind of support. I wish I could take my own life, but I lack the ability to overcome my own fear of death, even though I possess the means to do so. I feel like a prisoner on death row, in solitary confinement for years on end with nothing but their own thoughts to keep them company- no friends, no family, little to no human contact. I do not know what it's like to be happy, and in the end, I just really want a friend to talk to.

I didnt want to be close to him, just wanted to date so I didnt have to think about my problems all the time. He is 58 and I'm 53. I thought he would be mature-nope! He told me he couldnt stand me, I was too negative and he needed to not have all that in his life. It didnt bother me because things have started looking up for me and I didnt care what he said. Then he started wanting things back....58 yrs old. I was like...get lost...who ask for anything back that doesnt have value? Anyway, fast forward, I alone wanting to share my life with someone..the right one. My fear is dying alone having never loved again (I'm divorced). I have said Im going to start getting out more by myself, exploring more things because online dating is not working for me and I dont want to pay to meet losers...any advise on how to deal with being alone? ",loneliness
Don't like to be alone,"Its sad really really is. I can't sleep ,eat or even think right. I hate to be alone andi don't have any friends. I live with my parents for now I need some friends someone to talk to.",loneliness
Can 2018 be over already ?,"
 where do I even start , there was this guy who kept leading me on as if something is gonna happen between us , and I stupidly fell for him . And we used to text for long periods of time sometimes from 10 pm to 4 am talking about all kinds of things , he used to tell me how pretty I am , but then he stopped , he didn't open my messages anymore or even reply. After few weeks Later I was done with him I was gonna delete him from my social media and from my life , then he out of no where he texted my ( how are you?)
And he never respond back !!!!! What the is wrong with him ????? I deleted him few days later .  I was finally healing and getting myself back together when this girl who I thought she was my friend for 5 years turns out that she is only using me ,

And now I have to see her everyday, it's awful . All of it happened in 3  weeks .",loneliness
Opinions Please,"So I just have an opinion question.
I don't feel like I have many friends anymore because they are all older and moved and have kids. So I don't see them much. When I used to have more friends and went to see them we all had a good time. I always had more guy friends than girl friends so it was a pretty even mix. We would all get together and cook and share stories and jokes. Everyone was treated equal and everyone was included. Lots of my friends were married so their spouses were there, and some of them were related too. Maybe that's why it felt like a big happy family when we all got together.
Now that I have gotten older, I am starting to wonder if I had a really good but uncommon first experience with friendship and family and socializing. Now when I try to make new friends or go to visit family and friends of my boyfriend, I feel excluded. No matter where we go or who it is, they always separate the boys from the girls. I find this not only sexist but weird. Especially since I don't know these women and they always ignore me and have nothing nice or interesting to say. I have barely met my boyfriend's dad, and last weekend we got invited to his house but they separated us and I get stuck with his horrible step mother. The same thing happens where ever we go. I just don't feel included at all. This can't be normal.
I need opinions. Do you think it is normal to separate the men from women when visiting or hanging out with friends and family? Why does this happen? Is it a cultural thing, is it old fashioned, or is it some new trend? Worse still, could it just be that my bf deliberately wants to exclude me? Or maybe I get separated from the men and excluded from conversation with the women because I'm not married and have no kids. Maybe I just can't relate? Opinions?",loneliness
Chronic isolation,Chronic pain and illness equals chronic isolation. I'm lonely but I usually don't feel up to socializing. It's such a crazy cycle. This is my first post here... I hope you all are having a good day :) ,loneliness
Going Home,"Going Home: By Eugene Allen
Here I was approaching my hometown after spending the last thirty years behind prison walls. I could feel a sense of deep sadness and loneliness creeping into my heart. Was I coming home, or was I only trying to make up for all the years I spent behind those walls? 
How was it possible for such a backwoods kid to grow up and become such a dangerous criminal in the first place? All the years in prison, all the people I’ve hurt flashed before my eyes. I was wondering why such loneliness was coming over me. What was going on for me? Tears of sadness and joy were rolling down my cheeks. Why was I doing this in the first place? What was I trying to gain by coming home? In all actuality, there was no home. Mom and Dad had both passed away while I was in prison. The rest of the family had all moved away over the years. Yet I felt like I was being drawn to these hills as if by a magnet of life. 
I turned left at the four corners, and as I entered Main Street, I could see many changes in this little village that I used to walk as a young child. Nearly half of Main Street was missing. It had been destroyed by a terrible fire years ago and was never rebuilt. I found this out when I was eating lunch at the only diner in town. Things had changed considerably. Every factory in town had closed for some reason or another. The local tannery where dad worked for twenty years, had been closed by the EPA. This was a blessing in a way. I remembered as a child how the rivers were polluted with the dyes and chemicals from this place. We and the townspeople swam and ate fish from streams that ran out of this river. I wondered how many naive country people died because of this beast. My family alone suffered, with tumors, moms total blindness from a tumor, and babies being born with birth defects and death. To think that my dad worked for a mere sixty-five dollars a week for this company! However, it did provide food to bring his six children up. Back in those days, it was a blessing to have a job. 
I crossed the steel bridge which led to the country road leading home. One covered bridge had burned many years ago, the other was under repair from old age. This left our road, a one way to nowhere. 
As I drove a while, I noticed myself coming up on an old suicide curve. This curve had taken lives in the past and nearly took mine one New Year’s Eve. I was fifteen years old, driving without a license, and drunk. I missed the curve, went through the guard rail and through the ice into the river. I’m happy I was alone and no one was hurt. Somehow I was able to climb out of my car window and nearly froze to death walking home. I bragged about it for days because this was the sort of thing we would receive praise for in our family. It made me a big shot in my dad’s eyes. I would be considered a true Allen boy. I’d be living up to the criminal family history. What a distorted belief for a child to live by. My dad did change over the years to be a very nice man.
As I approached, on the left, the dairy farm that belonged to the family that rented our house to us for many years, I noticed that it had grown into a beautiful homestead. As a young man, I’d get drunk and drive my car to the edge of the road and smash their fences down. I did this just to have fun. I tried to kill one of their cattle on an evening when I was drunk. The bull chased me out onto the pond. I fell through the ice but was able to climb out on my own. My kid brother drove me home before I froze to death. I remembered stealing their gas one night because my car was on empty. The joke was on me this evening because it was diesel fuel. My engine froze up as soon as I put it in the tank. It practically ruined my car. This was just a beginning of my criminal career. The people on this road were some of my first victims. I spent my early teen years terrorizing this country neighborhood. I broke into houses, smashed windows and stole money from many innocent people. All this in the name of fun. Why were these memories all flooding my thoughts at this moment? Could it be that I was feeling remorse for the first time in my life about all of this? I wanted to stop and say I was sorry but would they believe me? I decided to continue driving toward home. 
Over the next hill, was the last stretch of road leading to my home. My stomach was becoming even more nervous. I noticed two of the neighboring houses didn’t exist anymore. They must have burned to the ground. I wondered if my house still stood for the many years that I was gone. 
There it was, home. It was still standing and nestled in the tall pines that surrounded it. It was vacant and tall grass was grown up all around it. Weeds and vines seem to imprison this old farmhouse which provided many years of shelter for my family and myself. 
I stepped out of my truck and stood silently in awe. I was feeling so lonely and sad. Tears flowed down my cheeks. I was home again. Where had all the years gone? Was this really home? Or was home only in my memories? I was such a young man when I left this place. Now my beard showed many traces of white and gray. There were times when I felt I’d never see this place again. I always believed I’d probably die in prison. But here I stood, all alone, in a fantasy land of memories. Mom was no longer standing on the front porch awaiting the school bus to bring me home. As I looked into the kitchen window, she wasn’t standing by the counter preparing our supper meal. I couldn’t hear her soft voice singing, I wanna Be Bobby's  Girl, as she would sing many years ago while doing dishes. Dad would yell from the back room, You better not be! She hadn’t been in the flower bed for some time either because by the looks, weeds had choked most of them...She wasn’t here! 
I turned to notice the outline of the old garden in the backyard. Dad wasn’t there picking the fresh green beans and carrots as he did for many years in the past. He wasn’t in the back shed feeding the animals either. He hadn’t mowed the grass for some time by the looks of it. I couldn’t hear the sounds of my brothers and sister running around the yard. They all seem to have drifted away. 
Then I noticed the full-grown weeping willow tree that Mom had planted as a little twig. I was in third grade at that time. The willow stood beside me as I was weeping. Did it miss my mom as I did? In a way, she gave birth to this child also. I gently touched its branches as if to feel a part of mom by my side. I wanted to feel a hug or see her smile, but the only voice I felt was the warm breeze, crawling off the cornfield. I couldn’t smell any homemade biscuits coming from the front door. There seemed to be no life around this place. I was feeling more loss the longer I stood there. A lonely feeling filled my heart with sadness. When I should have been happy being free for the first time after thirty years of confinement. I had not only hurt innocent people, but I had taken my parent’s son away from them for the rest of their lives. I had taken my children's dad away from them for all their childhood.  I couldn’t make up for that, could I? I guess what I really wanted to say, ""I’m home mom and dad!"" 
I wiped the tears from my eyes and cheeks, got back into my truck, and said ""Good-bye.. I love you!
Note: You can go to youtube, type in my author pen name, Grizman Parker and listen to songs I have written. My Dreams Take Me Home, was written for my mom. It doesn't cost anything.

All By Myself,"Most of my life I have been single and by myself. I think to alot of people 67 yrs. old this would be weird. I never seemed to have much luck with relationships- they always ended pretty much before they even really got started. I tried marriage in my early 20's- it lasted about 9 months (with no kids) but stayed ""legally married "" and very much single for 30 yrs. before I had to get a divorce. None of my friendships ever lasted either for more then a few years. I always  seemed to meet boozers,loosers,users.accusers and abusers. I could never figgure out why I deserved these kind of toxic people in my life. I've never been a drinker or a drug person other then weed. I never cheated or lied to any of my partners. I thought I always treated all my partners and friends with respect , love and affection. But now, after I look back upon my life I feel I was born to be single apparently. Now I am having some serious health issues. In Jan. 2015 ( at 64) I was diagnosed with a ""respiratory issue"""" then in late 2016 diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. This ""respiratory issue""interfered with my cancer treatment several times until I was pulled from my chemo halfway through my treatment (dropping my survival rate by about 20%) I was able to complete my radiation on 8/21/7  (the lunar eclipse). By Nov. 2017  my ""lung condition"" was much,much worse. I honestly thought I was going to die- I never coughed so much in my life. A deep,heavy choking on mucus cough. I went to the Dr. 2  times but was seen by the ARNP as my Dr. as out of town until Feb. 7th . The ARNP was useless and didn't do much but tell me to get cough meds- over the counter. In this 3 month period I really could not get out of bed except to use the bathroom and struggled to shower day after day. This was WORSE then my breast cancer was. When I FINALLY saw my Dr. on Feb. 7, 2018. She informed me that I had a double bacterial infection that was very serious and put me on 3 weeks of very strong antibotics. She also told me that all 4 pulmonary specialists thought I had ""Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis"" which is a fatal incurable lung disease with a survival rate of 3-5 years. So now I am on  oxygen 24/7, a C-Pap, and a nebulizer 4 times a day to breathe. Besides inhalers and pills. I am now going into my 4th yr. with this lung disease living on machines and pills all day and all night. By myself. I have no caregiver and no help with anything I need to do and really that has always pretty much been the same. Less and less is getting done now. I have almost given up going out of the house unless I absolutely have to. Nobody wants to be around someone sick and when you are sick you really could use help. Every day I wake up only to wish I hadn't. I don't want to be on this planet anymore like this. I was born alone and after living pretty much alone, I will die alone. This is no longer living- it's just suffering and being slowly sufficated and hoping to hurry up and die. ",loneliness
Article in Scientific American 1/2018?,Just wondering if anyone hwere read this article that I encountered on a visit to one of my local libraries. Would like to discuss with others here.

I'm not going to let it kill me,"I don't think there is a cure for loneliness or being alone. It's a fundamental quality of human existence. We are all single, alone, in our own minds no matter who we're with or how intimate we are with them. They say God was so alone that he had to create us not to feel so lonely, for the company, so to speak. But then things backfired horribly. So now everybody is alone. Things may be different on the other side but on this side you have to learn to cope with it. Embrace solitude. Sometimes being alone can become a festering wound - apply a dressing - maybe DS helps. If you let that wound go it'll start consuming the whole body - depression, then; perhaps even suicide. That is not the fate I would choose for myself - that's not what I want.",loneliness
What is this?,Im not sure what this should be in but its whatevs i need to talk or write...its been 4 years since me and my wife had separated bur still live together with our children she has another baby from another man and i am sitting rocking her baby to sleep while she does her wtf am i doing is this right i just want to live my life..,loneliness
Having no one,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I joined this group because I've never felt so alone in my life and I'd just like to talk to people that can relate to this. I moved away for university thinking that it would be a fun experience for me...boy was I wrong..it has definitely been one of the hardest experiences of my life. My first year was fine, I had nice roommates and enough financial aid to support me and not stress out about money. Second year came around and the financial aid that I was given was barely enough for my tuition and didn't cover my living expenses, I had to work 4-5 days out of the week.. sometimes I even had to skip classes to go to work. It still wasn't enough money to be able to support myself as after paying rent I was only left with about $200 in my bank account. It was very hard to keep up with school and my marks went down tremendously..my relationship with my father has always been complicated and during that time, we had stopped talking to each other, my boyfriend lives 6 hours away from where I live and I couldn't see him often. I fell into this deep depression where I wasn't even able to get out of bed in the mornings, I stopped caring about school, I had no motivation for the future, I was lonely... I felt like I had no one. I realized that I needed friends and so, I tried hard to meet new people but quickly realized that I was just forcing friendships..I was always inviting myself to their hang outs. So, I stopped forcing it and noticed how quickly they stopped talking to me. It was like I never existed. It's always been hard for me to make friends for some reason.. whenever I see two best friends, I feel sad because it's something that I want but seems like I can't have..I'm now finishing my third year of university and things were going ok for a while but it seems like I'm beginning to feel lonely again. I'm skipping class, I have no energy to get out of bed, no appetite and I just feel like I really just need someone to talk to who isn't my boyfriend. ",loneliness
I want to be by myself but hate feeling lonely...,"It sounds abosolutely crazy but there are times I just want to be by myself but I hate the feeling of loneliness.

I want to be alone with my friends I guess. Yes I am fully aware of how weird this sounds.",loneliness
Lost and alone,"Hello all, I don't normally post somewhere I haven't been a part of for a while. I like to comment and get to know the other people in the group before I jump in, but I'm at a pretty low place, right now, and I honestly don't have the time, I think, to lay the framework for friendship before I reach out for support. I am in a really low, dark place, and I have been here for such a long time and I have been incredibly lonely for so long. Like for most of my life. I've just never really had anyone I could go to, someone I could count on and trust. I didn't have parents or a family, and I don't have a significant other and while I'm not technically new to the area, I haven't really made any friends since I moved here about three years ago. I have one friend, my roommate, but we have a kind of odd co-dependent relationship where she helps me on the surface, but there's little emotional support. And it's not that she wouldn't be there for me like that if I asked her, but asking is the most difficult thing in the world for me. I never learned to ask for my basic needs to be met, I was taught that I couldn't demand such a thing, you know? I learned that anything I needed was extra, a privilege or luxury, and my needs were expendable and usually just at the whim and comfort of others. So, I don't know how to take care of myself and I don't know how to say, ""Hey, sorry, but I'm dying over here, can you help?"" and I don't know what to do, anymore. I have a young child and I am so worried that I cannot be there for him, or that now he is lonely because I have isolated him, because I don't know how to ask people to be in my life, and how to demand that people treat me well when they are in my life. I have no confidence whatsoever. I am a completely different person on the inside than I am on the out. And I so desperately want people to meet the real me, to know who I really am, but I can't show her to anyone, because I'm afraid they'll just hurt her, just like everyone else has hurt her, and I'm afraid she still doesn't know how to ask for what she wants and demand what she needs. I'm still too broken for mass consumption. I can't just jump outside and find friends, I'm easy pickings for humanity's monsters, right now. So, what do I do? How do I fill this deep pit of loneliness and despair inside of me? How do I find a way to want to live, again? How do you find joy in life when you're so alone and there is no hint at change in the near future?",loneliness
I'm alone amongst everyone...,"A lot of the posts I see on here are about people losing people and adjusting to being on their own. I have a family around me,  I have a great relationship with friends and co workers. Yet I feel as if I have absolutely nobody who truly understands me. Constantly feeling like I am being judged by my family. Comments being made as to ""oh your still single"" ""you need a relationship"". All my siblings have children and partners I am the only one on my own. I actually felt fine being on my own but I'm being made to feel as if I 'need' somebody in my life. Do they think I don't want somebody? Of course I do! But how is it my fault that I haven't found the right person. Everyone is making it seem like its a problem with me. I'm too serious, I'm too sensitive, I'm too uptight. I have suffered with depression on and off for years I go for long periods where I feel fine. Yet when I crash, I plummet down in to a self hating spiral where I don't trust anyone around me or want to speak to them. I have overheard conversations and read messages between my own family members being vicious and nasty and personal about me. The people who I am meant to feel most comfortable around and who are supposed to love me so much are doing this to me and its the biggest betrayal. Of course their are days where I forget and move on but on my down days it all comes back to me and I feel as if I'm suffocated and trapped around people I can't confide in. Then I get the blame for being closed and not telling people when I have problems. Can you blame me when I can't trust the people who I am supposed to tell?? I have wrote this all so fast I don't know if it even makes sense. It just feels a little better being able to rant and actually get some kind of release. I spend most of my time on my own because thats how I am being made to feel I deserve to be...alone. I hate life sometimes. I can't cope. sometimes I dont want to cope anymore. Then I sleep, I wake up and its a new day. Til the next crappy situation sends me on a downward spiral. How to deal, how to deal...",loneliness

Feeling overwhelmed,Just thought I would put this out for others opinions and comments. I have been feeling overwhelmed for some time now. I lost my husband 4 yrs ago and became ill. I can no longer drive so I am homebound most of the time. I have no friends that have contacted me much since my husband's passing. I rely alot on 3 of my 6 children and that makes me anxious and feeling useless. I have tried to due things but I don't get much joy in it as I have Noone to share things with.

Feeling Lonely and Co-Dependent,"I've been in a serious committed relationship for 10 years, we both are only 23 and met when we were younger. I have been struggling with loneliness because I have some mental disorders that prevent me from keeping a job or being able to stay socially active. I've been distancing myself from everyone around me by accident, while I want to be social I can't bring myself to do so. It's to the point I feel like a dog just waiting for my owner to get home, the owner being my boyfriend obviously. I'm depressed and lonely all day until he gets home. Sometimes I won't eat or do anything until he returns, I just sit here or lay here. Seeing going out in public alone gives me bad anxiety, I don't like going out any place unless he's with me. No, he isn't abusive and it's honestly not his fault I'm this way. He pretty much just goes to work and then comes home, when he is home we do pretty much everything together. I'm scared what if something happens one day to him? I'm already alone and depressed... I feel like everyone forgets about me and that I don't exist. Even when I'm around others sometimes I still feel alone and empty.",loneliness
Not as lonely as I used to feel because...,"I've distanced myself from a lot of the negativity and it has helped tremendously. I'm still working on it and likely will be for awhile, too. I still struggle from time to time with loneliness, but not as much as I did last week or even last month. The issues I've had to heal on my own are emotional more then physical and that in itself has been really hard to do while living with the main person that has done the most harm to my heart and soul. I feel and have felt that distracting myself just wasn't/isn't enough anymore and I needed to do a lot more then I was doing, so, I started sleeping in a whole other room every night from him and not being affectionate or empathizing as I usually am and have been cause that is where I give in and allow his the power back to hurt me again.
I got to the end of my rope and said enough is definitely enough and I'm so glad I did that a couple of months ago. I give him kudos for not pushing me to be forgiving again like I have been in the last 4 or 5 years because I know that if he did/does that I would've blown up at him and likely had to have been taken away in a police car or something. The other things I have been doing is really opening myself up in groups and to other friends that I thought I didn't trust with these types of feelings and they aren't as negative as I thought they would be. I'm also not being hard on myself because I've allowed it to happen all those times. I'm very at peace with that because I know I've never deserved the treatment he handed me and still don't if it happens again. I have looked to God for aide in pushing through the loneliness a few times and it has helped when I needed it most. I will continue to do this, journaling and posting again too when needed. I'm getting stronger and stronger emotionally each day. I know it doesn't happen over night or even in a week, but everyday counts and I'm happy God has woken me up each day thru this because I was at a point where I wished he wouldn't the next morning more then once. 
If you have struggled with loneliness, but gotten through it similar to this, how did you do it and where in your recovery are you now? Please feel free to message me or even friend me and we can help each other more. Positivity and perserverence is what its all about in my opinion. Happy Valentine's Day 2018!",loneliness

I have love to give but no one wants it,"I can't help but feel I'm taken for granted. Everyone always has to compliment me on how strong I am to have gone through what I've experienced, through all the depression, abuse, bullying, rejection, and abandonment and somehow I'm still here.
You seem to mistake me for some kind of unbreakable force because I've never resorted to substance abuse or self-harm to cope with the pain. Just because I'm still here and fighting doesn't mean I want to be.
I am not invincible. I am not unbreakable. I am hurt. Badly. By many people who I desired to be close to, and many who given their roles in my life should have been. Whether they be family or online. And I don't think I'm going to get better.
I pushed forward all this time because of a delusion of false hope and nothing more. That maybe, someday, someone will love me. For real. To allow me close to them and hold them and they themselves returning the favor not just to appease me but because they truly feel that way. That one day I won't be alone anymore. But that day isn't coming.
It doesn't matter how much of a good person or friend I am to others, fact of the matter is no one cares enough to let me closer than an arm's distance and it fucking kills me inside. I have all the love in the world in my heart to give and no one wants it.

I try to think of anyone I can message to make this go away and nothing helps. How do I survive like this? How do I survive with this huge gaping hole in my heart that literally hurts me so bad I feel like I can physically feel it. ,loneliness
saying hi,"i'll guess i'll start here. seems like the easiest place and group to start in.
lonely? yeah...i've got that covered.
i've been living in a group home two years after it was determined i was a danger to myself and couldn't live on my own anymore. i have just been given limited, supervised access to the internet and i only leave here escorted on planned and supervised trips.
no one visits me because there is no one left in my life anyone.
i don't claim to be a saint...some great person who was wrongfully abandoned, etc... a lot of this situation is my own fault. but i'm still a person and this is a shitty and lonely way to live. i'm having a hard time ""working on me"" and making any progress when i'm cut off from the world and isolated like this.
maybe i deserve it, maybe i don't. i don't know.
but i hate it.",loneliness
Alone vs Lonely,"There has been this common stigma that being alone is similar as being lonely. There can be days where I do not mind being alone, sometimes I even enjoy. But, being lonely is different because I could be surrounded in a room full of people yet feel completely alone. I bumped into this quote from a book I’ve been reading called Be Brave by Cheryl Strayed saying “Alone had always felt like an actual place to me, as if it weren’t a state of being, but rather a room where I could retreat to be who I really was.” I dont know how I feel about this quote other than to he sad because of the phrases “alone” and “who i really was.”",loneliness
Can you be happy alone?,I only feel satisfied when I am validated by the love of other people. How do I extend that love to myself? I've learned that you can't always lean on people. You can't put your happiness in their hands; they'll drop it. But I don't know how to make myself happy on my own.,loneliness

Dating in a Bubble,"I mostly just need to vent, so please disregard if this bores you. 
Honestly, I am just so tired of trying to date with a chronic illness. It doesn't take long to figure out that when people ask how you are doing - to be polite - they don't actually want to hear the truth because the truth isn't full of sunshine and flowers. So, the habitual answer becomes, ""I'm fine"", and you stop being real with anyone since it's so much easier just to give them the answer that they want and go on listening to their fun adventures. Why would you want to talk about your life anyway? Somehow, hospital visits and more doctors just don't hold a candle to your friends' tales of white water rafting and their latest boyfriend drama.
Oh, and don't forget the isolation! Online dating truly sucks. You don't really get to know people when there is no body language to read or subtle hints to gauge where the conversation should go. Besides, in this age, people want quick gratification so that they can go on being lazy and not put in any real effort. Why work for a relationship when you can just join the latest hook up site and go on with your bad self? 
The catch is, living in a bubble doesn't allow for good sex or quick gratification. Life stays messy 90% of the time, and it's rather difficult to find anyone with enough muster to stick around when the daisies aren't blooming on a regular basis. Sure, it's great when we feel good and can go out, but what about when we are too sick to venture out? Where is the guy who plans a big picnic on the living room floor so that you can ""leave the house""? And where is the man who brings you fresh flowers, your favorite movies, and a fresh playlist to quell the boredom? When did medical isolation become an easy excuse for people to give up and walk out of your life just because it takes more effort to pursue the relationship?
These movies, of the sick girl finding her true love through the window, are nice... but who honestly thinks that portrays real life?

Okay, rant concluded. Thanks for reading today's version of ""Hey, Valentine's Day is coming up, so I'm going to sulk and turn into a cynical twit who hates the world"".

not even wanted by my parents.,"I am in my 30's. I live with my kids and my husband. I have a family I care for and support. We share love daily in my home. Yet, I long for the thing I will never have. 
This week was my mom's birthday. I have had plans for weeks that this weekend I was going to go to their house with my family and take my mom out for a night of dinner and a movie for her birthday. She was so excited.... until my brother stepped in. 
My brother and his wife are fighting again, so all of a sudden he wanted to come stay at my parents and help them out. It doesn't matter that he doesn't want to 99% of the time and would rather bitch at me for not doing enough to help them and complain to me that he could do it better. But when my brother and his wife are fighting, he flees to their home to retreate from his wife in any way he can. He has beens stayng with my parents for a week now. Oh, don't worry about him missing out on work - he doesn't have a job and my parents send him money regularly to pay for his family bills. 
So he went up to stay with my parents, and while he was there he earned his keep by cutting fire wood and cleaning things he has stored there since forever. 
It is not that I am mad that he actually went up and helped out my parents. Frankly I wished he would do so more often. It is what it causes me that upsets me. My mother worries abut my brother greatly and having him around makes her alhimers worse. Each day I call, and this week, she forgot it was her borthday, forgot to make dinner, and couldn't remember if my brother had stayed the one night. These seem small, but they are signs of a bad day. 
The other thing it causes is my parents to cast me aside. My parents rely on me for so much. My brother is not good for much, and certainly not relyable or dependable.... but when he is around, there is suddenly no communication with me, and assumptions that my brother will take care of everything. This usually leads to bills not getting paid, drs appointments being missed, and many other things. 
So what.... why do I care - because they are my parents - that's why. 
But why else.... because they don't want me. They have the child they love and miss so much, so I am not needed. So what did that means this weekend - my mom telling me that John was going to take her out for her birthday, so it didn't matter that my kids had made her gifts or planed to bake her a cake or even that my brother would use my mom's money to take them out... what mattered was that her favorite child was there for her birthday, so I didn't need to be. 
It makes me want to scream! I want to  say - fine - let him take you to your next Drs appointment, too. Let him ballance your check book. Let him get off his lazy ass and do something. 
Nope. I smile and say, if that's what you want mom. 
In church we are studying the prodical son story and currently we are on the older brother - talking about how we get caught in these traps of being like the older brother when we expect that our good behavior will equal good things in this life or that we deserve anything from our following of the right and rightious path. We then choose resentment, anger, and bitternes when positive outcomes do not come from positive attempts, which is not a G-dly thing but temptations from our human-ness. 
Well. I al the older brother in the story. I have done everything asked of me and all I have ever gotten was screwed. And continued to be unloved and unwanted by my parents.  
There have been times in my life that I have been able to choose something other than resentment, but then I get slapped in the face again and again, and I cling to it once more. 
How do I let it go? How do I accept that my parents don't love me or want me but only call me when they need something and I am useful. How do I move past the bitterness? How do I teach my own children not to feel this way when I can't stop?",loneliness

Crazy brains make things difficult,"Hello everyone. I am new to this site, but I thought I would share some musings from last night. So, as I pondered life until four o'clock in the morning, I finally discovered an interesting article. 
Backstory: For as long as I can remember, I have connected both quickly and strongly to other people. Then, I get deeply hurt when they do not return the same amount of affection, love, loyalty, dedication, etc. within the relationship. This, of course, leads me into the downward spiral of thinking that I will never find anyone who attaches as permanently as I do. Other people seem so flaky that I eventually quit trying to allow people close to me at all - not the best medicine. 
Anywho, the article suggested that this tendency to attach so intensely to things (people, pets, hobbies, etc.) is actually just a way for our brains to escape a reality that is too difficult. By way of dopamine pathways (and some other scientific details that I cannot remember at the moment), our brains make a new reality that is more pleasant to behold. The entire occurrence is actually more common in those with mental health issues - like OCD, anxiety, depression, and others. 
I'm not sure what y'all think; however, I found it sort of comforting to know that there is a reason for the unending tendency toward complete loneliness. Perhaps, we might receive some relief from telling ourselves that it's okay to feel this way. There is nothing wrong with us; rather, our brains just enjoy trying to fix things without sending out a memo. Ha. 
Does anyone else make these really intense connections to people and then feel entirely too lonely when other people do not match up? Just curious....",loneliness
I need someone to talk with,"New here.
I joined because I'm so sick of being alone constantly. I'm single and live by myself. No one ever calls or reaches out to me, and people seldom respond when I try to contact them. I lost my job unexpectedly recently, I'm scared I'm going to be homeless, and I could really use a sympathetic ear. But everyone I've called or texted has either not responded or said they're too busy and to ""hang in there.""
I don't know how I ended up like this. I used to have a number of friends who would go out to lunch, meet for coffee or a movie, or just hang out. But over the years, people have drifted away--moved, had kids and grandkids, gotten busy with other things ... It seems like everyone moved on and no one took me with them. I can go for weeks without speaking to anyone I know. I haven't been invited to anyone's house for the holidays in a couple of years. The last time I went out to lunch with anyone was in August.
I'm tired, I'm scared, and with my recent job loss, I'm worried about how much longer I can go on like this. Any suggestions? (Please, no advice to go walk around a mall.)",loneliness
started physical therapy,"So today was my first day of physical therapy and i am left with more questions than answers. still. 
The physical therapist - dr dan.. lol - does not believe that it is a crushed c7 like the dr does. He thinks it presents too much like carple tunnel, and was confused by the results in the chart. Frankly, he said he was afraid to treat me in a lot of ways until the MRI because he doesn't want to mess anything up and feels like we are shooting in he dark right now.
So here is my physical therapy experince. First they give me a chart in 3 pages that maps out the whole body in detail that i am to mark where it hurts right now today and what kind of hurt. I was challenged 3 times by 3 different people on all of the areas i marked. yes - those places all hurt right now and yes they all hurt about 90% of my day. 
Then you walk into this room that reminds me of a combination of toddler play area and torcher dungeon. Next i do silly things to see if it hurts me more or less.... neither - constant. I am surrounded by all of these geriatric and cripped people struggling strenuously to do anything, and all i can think is what am i doing here.  I have had poor dr experiences in the past so i want to be comfotable and ask questions to the dr about why he chose this and what he likes about his job. he chastizes me for not counting chin tucks and elbow bends but guessing as i talk to him. 
i don't know anything about the equipment and I am re-guessing what i think comfort and normal means in my life, so i don't know how things should fit or what things should feel like or how to know if anything is working. overall I am just very confused. 
At the end of my almost 2 hours I am asked if i feel any better .... no? was i supposed to? I mean it's just the first day, right?
he asks me to come back on friday scared that if we stop the insurance company will not pick up and pay for it again, but i am responsible for half each payment up fromt anyway..... so is this worth it or just another finacial drain on my family?
Then i call my dr and talk to him about the stabbing pain in the base of my head from the steroids and how it makes my muscles ache. that is apparently a reasonable side effect and i am told to just continue and it will be ok. 
 i just don't know what to think. am i making the right decisions? what do we know anyway? should i be taking some other tests to help me understand what is really happening? how will i know if it is working or not? what if all this is for nothing?
i feel so lost.... am i doing the right thing?

Last wekend,"So this past weekend was one of my best friend's birthday. I went over to his apartment (he lives with my other best friend) and we invited some other friends over that I didn't know as well, but have still known for a long time now. I knew they all wanted to go hit up bars and/or clubs, which I had told them I was fine with as long as we could be back at a semi-reasonable hour. This was all agreed to. So it's like 7:30-8 and a new person I had no idea was coming over pops her head in. Ok, fine, I can deal with something like this. Turns out she primarily came over to give my friend some birthday weed, which I knew both of my friends smoked to some degree. But I'm thinking, dear god please don't smoke this shit in here. Of course, they end up smoking in the apartment, despite my insistance that they go outside (they were worried about the legality of it being in the home vs. outside the home). It smells goddamn awful. I was gagging and choking. It was not a fun time. I'm pretty sure they all thought I was being overdramatic. It's like 9:30 now, weed girl has left and the other two girls we were all kind of friends with had come over. I've had one drink. Everyone else has had like three. We're finally ready to leave. We stand out in the cold, for like an hour or more to try and get into a club. We ended up leaving to go to a bar, where I have one more drink and everyone else has at least two more drinks before I call it quits and want to go back to the apartment. One of my friends hands me his keys, I call an uber, and I'm back by 12:20. But I couldn't sleep. I kept myself up thinking about how I'm the wet blanket friend. They could've done all of this without me. I was unnecessary. What really pushed me over the edge though, I think, was that I was texting with another friend of mine, who I really like a lot, and she was doing the exact same thing as my friends. Literally, verbatim. She was high and drunk, and it made me extraordinarily uncomfortable, and it shouldn't have. She's free to do what she wants, she's a grown woman, and it's not like we're together. So why did I feel so uncomfortable with the whole situation? My own mind makes very little sense to me sometimes. I don't like drinking, I've never smoked weed, I've never been drunk. These are just not things that I do, nor do I think they're fun. But my friends do, all of them, apparently. And it's not like I can be the sole determining factor in what my friends and I do when we all get together. That's not fair to them. I've been trying to reconcile these thoughts and I just can't. It's like I want to control the evening, but I want it to be my friend's choice. Like they'll say, ""oh you're coming over? great, what movie do you want to see? oh, you want to be in bed by 11? sure, we'll be quiet."" And that's just not a realistic expectation. Of course, if they want to go out drinking they should be free to. If they want to smoke, they should be free to. I just don't want to do any of that, and that makes me feel like I don't belong, which is a horrible thing to feel when I'm with people that I've known for 14 years of my life now. I feel like an anti-24 year old. Many people my age, and some younger even, do this kind of shit all the time. It makes me feel like a 60 year old man, that my idea of a fun evening out is getting dinner, seeing the latest movie, and, if I want to get really crazy, go bowling or something, and be in bed by 11. People of my generation don't do that, as I'm constantly told by my friend. I feel almost abandoned by my friends, like I can't have fun with them if I'm not willing to be out all hours of the night and spend exorbanant amounts of money on drinks that I won't finish.",loneliness
awake..... again,"So I have been awake since 10pm.....it is 4am.... church starts in a few hours.... I took a nap between 7-10 pm.... I didn't mean to, now I can't sleep. 
So I am now taking these mega doses of steroids. I don't know what the Dr is trying to achieve exactly, but here is what I am achieving. I am SUPER emotionl, my pain has intensified, and I sleep at random times, just not at night. 
I am sooooo out of my element right now, and it bothers me. 
Usually, I have the answers to the questions. I have some posssible solutions. I have some control of a situation. Or at least well informed advice....
Now - I am grasping at straws and have no idea what I am supposed to do. I am questioning everything I took as the way life is to be. I question what normal is suposed to be. I question what I have accepted as normal for years... for as long as I can remember. I question any advice any Dr has ever told me. 
I feel like things are spinning around me at times and I am reaching out but too afraid to grab anything. 
I start physical therapy on Monday. I have never been to a physical therapist. I have no idea what to expect. 
See, I am from a tough family. We were VERY POOR farmers. Things happened, and we just had to push through them sometimes to get the job done. My parents did it all the time, and I was expected to follow. And I have. 
My family needs me. I am the bread winner. I am the mother. I am the anchor. I don't have time to be sick. there is no call in person for my shift as mom or bread winner. So I push on. 
I busted my back when I was 18, and I am terrified as to what that may mean to me now.
I have met... well. ... I am not joking when I say this... probably over 100 people who collect disability and do not work for less than legitamate reasons. Now, before you start on me for not being forgiving, understanding, or all the other things I have been accused of... let me give you some prime examples....  (Because trust me - I have met just as many who collect for perfectly legitamate reasons)....
Did you know you can collect disability for being gay? Well, you can. This gentleman and his life partner lived in a rural area. The life partner had a great job in the area and was well respected by the community. He lived a quiet life, and kept his personal life personal, but guess what - in a small town everyone knows, but no one cares as long as it is not the only thing you define your life with. The other, though, wanted to live a flamboyant life - which is his choice - but he decided to file for disability because in his opinion his life style in a small area prevented him from working..... and he won disability. The reason - He was gay. seriously. He was so happy to share this with others and felt more people should file for this reason. 
Did you know you can collect disability for your own dog steping on your foot without breaking a single bone. Now, in their defense, they had a decent sized dog... a lab cross of some kind. The mom collected disability for a foot injury. So one day, we were just talking and she tells me how it started... while laughing at her luck and sucess at this. She was cooking in the kitchen when her dog stepped on her foot. She thought she heard a pop and went to the emergecy room. Nothing broken. Nothing out of place even. But, she hated her job, so she filed for disability. ... and she won. She no longer had to work because her job required her to stand, and standing hurt while her foot was healing.... But wen I met her, she had been on disability for YEARS. Best part was she told me this while jogging on a treadmill and the SAME DOG slept on the floor next to her. 
Yeahhh.... I could go on. so.... Less than legitamate. 
It is these kinds of people that I take the time to teach that being an adult and wanting a better life, sometimes takes some hard work and a little sacrafice. It is these people that I would talk to about breaking my back at 18, being offered disability for the rest of my life, and instead deciding that I wanted to work because i was just starting my adult life. 
Now I question... did I do the right thing.... ever?
Am I a hypocrite to these people if the Dr forces me to collect partial disability and not work my current full time job because of the problems it is causing me according to him.....
I guess I just feel scared and alone.  ",loneliness

Not sure what to do,"I have never fully shared my story but this is just a part of it. I have always struggled with relationships in my life, always felt as though I have never mattered to anyone. Growing up my dad showed zero emotion, he was robotic but dependable. My mom was the exact opposite, overbearing, emotional, depressed, anxious, you name it. As a result I learned to hide anything I felt to prevent any further depression in my mother.  I have very little empathy and I only feel that I truly care about my dogs. I have been diagnosed with an attachment disorder which explains why relationships seem so difficult to me.  Growing up I remember my friends would stop wanting to be friends because I was too weird and they were better than me.  One of my first relationships with a guy was awful, he was emotionally abusive and couldn't care at all about me. I remember going to a party with him as a teenager and passing out after drinking too much thinking he would take care of me. Then I woke up to another guy with his hands down my pants and when I came too and woke up my boyfriend he told me I was overreacting and not tell anyone and go back to sleep.  Ever since then I have been in emotionally abusive, controlling relationships. Then I finally thought I found someone good, he treated me well and I wanted to marry him. In the relationship my attachment disorder strained the relationship. I couldn't tell him how I felt, ask for anything, and I felt as though i always kept myself at a distance. Never the less I still loved him. We were to get married and 2 weeks before the wedding he cancelled. The public humiliation was awful. I was crushed. But stupid me wanted to still be with him, we patched things up and went to couples therapy. That lasted about a year then all of a sudden he gets distant, wouldn't come home at night, wouldn't return my calls at 3 am when I woke up and he wasn't home yet. Later I found out he was cheating on me with one of my best friends, who was going to be a bridesmaid in the wedding I never had. That was the end of our relationship and I went into severe depression and drinking. I've since cut back on my drinking but the depression is off and on, and it's been over a year since we broke up. I find myself pushing more and more away from people and the loneliness is eating away at me. I have no friends anymore. I try to find things to go to in my city but it's always alone. I just hope every time I go out someone will just say hi and start a conversation with me to get some new friends but it never happens. I'm so shy I could never approach someone on my own. I'm so used to being rejected that I just avoid people assuming they want nothing to do with me. I don't know what to do anymore.

Anyway, Ive been thinking about asking another friend to go get food because he got me a giftcard to a certain restaurant we both like, but he ghosted me from the last time I saw him (last month), basically. Havent had a legit conversation with him since, but I want to hangout because we havent in a month and I figured I have nothing else to lose, since I havent been trying to hang out with him, causing him to ghost me or anything like that.

Alone From The Taken,"I have been in a very interesting realationship. When people say that they have been through it all well I can relate. This relationship has been such a ride that it can be so lonely at times. He was served papers this week. See he went and got married three months in our relationship to a woman he thought he could spend his life with. Its all about appearance and what everyone else sees so he was playing along with this dream idea he had. Now you can read the whole story in my journal but either way its been two years going on three. He is no longer communicating with his ex wife and has swept it under the rug. This is no big deal to me since marriage has been broken in my eyes. I don't want to get married ever! This is a good example of why. So he thought she would just move on and forget about it. He has justified himself and made excuses to cover up that he even got married. Like to him, he didn't! So Monday morning at 6 AM the door sounded and he was served. She filed for divorce! It all real now. He is so angry now. I feel so alone again. In a realtionship your suppose to communicate and be honest. He shuts down and tells me I am not involved. Therefore I am not and step back making it lonely at times. I know he is upset and stressed. I know if he opened up and used the fact that I am here then we wouldn't be so seperated.

Meh birthday...,"So today was my birthday, yet it's made me feel down. I got a text from my mum and one of my sisters  (I have 2 sisters, 1 brother), my mum dropped off a present and card from her and my dad. My boyfriend only remembered it was my birthday after I'd told him about my daughter singing happy birthday to me and he posted on Facebook. Then he caused an argument.Yeah I got messages on Facebook, but today was meh. I always do special cards for those closest to me and try to give thoughtful presents. I'm not bothered about receiving gifts but I just feel like the only person who cared was my 9 year old daughter. And that is pretty amazing, she's an amazing little girl and that is all that matters I suppose. But I just don't feel special to anyone else.
I know this probably sounds stupid and I can't even describe how I'm feeling. I just feel like no one cares enough to make me feel special. And I feel like this almost every year. Probably sounds selfish. But I never get fussed over and everyone needs to be fussed over once in a while don't they?",loneliness
Is this it?,"I just recently turned 29 and have dealt with depression and social anxiety due to loneliness since I was around 17 or so.. This latest episode feels like it could be the end of the line for me, I keep having thoughts about how I don't really care much for living my life and it has become scary. 
To put things into perspective, I grew up in a family that was completely broken, I haven't spoken to any members of my family in about 10 years and for good reason.. This has promoted an independent lifestyle for me which over the years has developed into unhealthy isolation.
In addition to this I do have a handful of friends however Ive never been a ""key cog"" in our friendship circle.  I can and have gone up to 5 months at a time where I receive no texts or phone calls from my friends asking me to join them in any kind of activity or to even just see how things are going. I understand at my age that my peers are all developing their own lives with wives and kids but to know that I only get invited to things if I just so happen to be around during the planning is rather painful.. I feel like everyone else is on the same train and I got left at the boarding station. 
I've had several girlfriends in the past, even very recently, however that is truly the only time I feel happy in life. A relationship provides me a purpose and anchor in life which I just can't seem to provide myself with. I'm lead to believe that being so dependent on someone else to help me feel like life is worth living is not healthy.. either way I'm single now and because of my anxiety and lack of social circle it is hard for me to meet new women the older I become.
Much of my single life is spent just trying to survive each day to get to the next. Most weekends I don't interact with anyone other than cashiers or attendants. I often will just drive aimlessly through out the day just to give my body a physical distraction.. Sometimes I'll just go to random shops with no intention to buy anything, it just gives me a way to make it to the next day of life. This has gone on for many years and it's only getting harder on me. 
I am in therapy for all of this however it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference. My therapist and the few people I've opened up to have simply suggested that I just go ""where the people are"" and let things develop.. I've been trying this for some time now and I'm making no progress.. I've gone to coffee shops, yoga classes, local concerts and other such things by myself but they don't provide me with any sense of accomplishment. Simply being around people isn't enough, it's the deep connection to others that I crave and what eludes me.. But I don't know how to establish these connections.. It bugs me when people tell me to just start up random conversations with strangers, it's really not that easy and when I do it never develops past just small talk. 
I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this write up, i don't even suspect anyone to read this whole thing but it was suggested to me when I texted a crisis hotline. Again, I don't know how much longer I can realistically expect myself to live a life I hate. I'm quickly running out of resources and I've exhausted the few people who will listen to me, it's frustrating and painful to go through life like this.. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas please let me know, it could very well save my life. ",loneliness

Late Christmas gift,"I still have to give my friend his christmas gift but within the last month, he has stopped reaching out to me, ignored my calls and texts, but continues to keep in touch with our mutual friends. With that in mind, Im done trying to keep in touch at the moment because he doesnt reciprocate, even when I try asking him over text if hes gonna get his present from my house/the means of giving it to him, he ignores me. For god's sake, its his gift and its like pulling teeth just getting him to get it from me. Knowing all this, should I still try to give him his gift, leave it on his front porch, or even give him his gift at all? He gave me my gift already, but left it in my mailbox (which he doesnt have so I cant leave his gift in it) so I never saw him. If he wants nothing to do with me right now, he could still just get his gift from me and go home as soon as he gets it. This whole situation has annoyed me to not even want to give it to him, but I am still willing to just drop it off at his house, if thats the last straw.",loneliness

I can't take this pain,"As I am writing this I may be having an anxiety attack because I feel it coming and Im shaking.  I went on snapchat and saw my friend hanging out with our mutual friend and the thing is, the mutual friend told me he has been extremely busy lately, which should explain why he doesnt answer my texts or calls but seeing him with our mutual friend without me makes my neck actually burn.  I get it, we all dont have to be together, Ive hung out with both of them without the other, but it just makes me feel even more alone because they both purposelly chose to not reach out to me this time and include me.  Since those two became friends, whenever I would go to hangout with the one, they would always text the other to come along.  I just feel the betrayal that I wasnt invited, when they always invite each other along and burning anger (physically) that my friend has the audacity to never reach out to me anymore because apparently he's ""busy"", but he has time to hangout with our mutual friend.  I feel like I have no friends anymore, no one is loyal and I know I am probably exaggerating since I am experiencing a lot right now emotionally but I am hurting and I feel alone. I have known our mutual friend for about 10 years now and I must not mean anything to her because she never asks me to hangout with her one on one, meanwhile he comes into her life for a few months and theyre already going one on one, but not dating or anything.

Basically, for a long time I have had people who live in my head that both simultaneously feel like a part of me but also are separate from me. I don't dissociate and they don't ever take control of my body, but I can hear them in my head, they speak differently, I know their names, I know what they look like, and they even have houses and different outfits and everything. Sometimes it can be fun to have them around, but it can also be very frustrating when I need to concentrate, and I think other people notice that I can't concentrate at times because they are talking a lot or sometimes I space out because I'm listening to them instead of paying attention to what's going on around me. Over the last year, most of them have disappeared which is bittersweet but also gives me peace of mind.

More Active Support Groups On DID/OSDD-1B,"Hello! My name is Lee, I'm not the Host but we are a 19 year old system. That is, we have a dissociative disorder. We came to this website to support others as I and the others are now at a point in our life where we belive we've gone through the worst and now have treatment and support. I noticed that this site was dead and so I wanted to give 2 suggestions for support groups that are active to help others.
Both of these Support Groups are on an App called Amino. You can get it on the Play store, it is completely free. 
Once you arrive on Amino please type either ""System Share"" or ""DID & OSDD-1"" in the community search box. (Or you can type both if you like.)
System Share is a quieter support group for those with DID or OSDD-1. this is where you can learn information or support others or recieve support. It can have around 1-4 posts per day. Everyone is allowed to post and there are many chats. I am a staff member in the community so if anyone here ever needs help getting around feel free to contact me. Our name on there is ""The Resistance""
DID & OSDD-1 is about the same but it is much more active with over 1,000 members in the group. (system share has around almost 300 and some members) The chats (Especially the general chat, Vent chat, and questions chat) are extremely active. There are many more chats and options but it can be a tad overwhelming. (Our name there once again is The Resistance.)
If anyone chooses to try these support groups out please send us a private message so we can get you settled in and show you how things work if needed. If not our messages box on here is always open to help anyone who may need it.

"Non-multiple, new to group. New to DId","Hello,
I read a post where the writer refers to themselves as a non-multiple. I’m 47 years old and for most of my life my siblings and I have had a painful relationship with our mother. We have been verbally abused, lied on, emotionally abused, physically abused as teens, and rejected by a person who has never taken accountability for their own actions but sees themselves as the victim of everyone else. Estrangement come after conflict only to have our mother come around after periods of time as if all were fine. There is a history of drug abuse, but we currently don’t see signs of anything beyond marijuana and alcohol presently. For the most part we have maintained our distance. But, over the past six months she has reached out and seems dramatically different. Calm, reasonable, pleasant. . .safe. However, I began to notice contradictions. I hear the narcissistic tone. I pay closer attention to the references to herself in the third person that never made sense. Eventually, it dawns on me that my mother has dissociative identity disorder. Once I realize this, I fully see it! My siblings and I have always seen it, we just didn’t recognize it- if that makes sense. We had already used variations of her name to describe her ever changing personas. 
My siblings remain at  distance. But, I have enjoyed interractions with a mother who I stopped realizing she truly existed. 
Miraculously, my mother agreed to go therapy with me- something that she would have never ever agreed to in the past. However, the toxic person shows up. (This is just the best way I know to explain that history) The therapist sees it, but says she does not have much experience with DID. She does feel comfortable with working with us in relationships therapy. 
But, how do I do this with unpredictable participants? All I know to do is to appeal to my mother and call out the inconsistencies. 
Prior to our session, ‘they’ overheard me talking to my brother about multiple personalities.  ‘Mommy’ was calm and forgiving and chalked it up to kids being kids, which for me was refreshing and comforting. But ‘Charlotte’ told the therapist we were bitter, disrespectful and humiliating ‘as always’. I didn’t argue with Charlotte because I didn’t want things to escalate to where I have to deal with “Charlie.” As Charlie puts it, “you don’t want to deal with Charlie.”
I know my mother was traumatized as a child. Until now, I never understood how and why she could perpetuate so much of the very pain that she suffered from. 
I now understand that Charlotte is who I have seen most, there to protect my mother. Charlotte acts bitterly, abusively and behaves like a narcissist and she would be fine without any of us. She believes her own distorted reality and sees enemies and abusers in the people who do love them. 
My ‘Mommy’ clearly expresses that she wants to have a relationship with me. I actually enjoy her. But, the dynamics change so fast sometimes that feel lost. I have faith that I have ‘caught on’ for good reason. While I feel traumatized, myself, by Charlotte, I want to be a safe place for them.

I'm not sure how disorders start or anything like that, so I don't know when it actually manifested itself in her life.
What I do know is she must have gone through some really bad experiences between nineteen (later when I do what I think would be like the backstory), I am thinking, perhaps it hadn't totally manifested itself until she was older and with the guy who was her boyfriend for around fourteen years.  He was a total asshole. I know he physically and emotionally abused her but there could have been some sexual abuse as well.  From what I gathered, between Jan. to early March, 2019, she did Meth when she was with him. He was already an addict, I'm not sure why she tried it, however from a limited amount of research and especially since I was an alcohol/drug abuse counselor, I had already known that there are times when drugs like LSD and Meth can ""kick off"" a disorder which is already present but not diagnosed: like in the case of Syd Barrett, one of the founders of ""Pink Floyd"", when he did LSD, it did whatever, to manifest his schizophrenia.
Anyway, to shorten this, I am only going to say this: after she figured out her life was worth more than living with the idiot she was with, who had done the abuse, she left.  I believe for two years, as she informed me, before we met, she quit Meth.  I met her in summer of 2006, she was a lovely, sweet, wonderful, empath sort, who had dedicated herself to work as a RN in ""rest homes"" specializing in care for Ahlzheimer patinets in the end stage.  When we first met, I saw absolutely no sign of her disorder, she seemed just as ""normal"" as anybody else.  It was weird though, after a month of knowing each other she informed me that ""sometimes"" she wasn't herself, especially when she got angry and that she ""had issues.""  Well hell, who doesn't right?  There were only about three times during our first six months together, that her anger flaired up, it was over little things, but once it had flared up, it went away pretty quickly.  But when she did ""warn"" me that time with: ""you might not want to start a relationship with me, I get angry sometimes, not much though, and I am another person until it blows over, so think about it before you commit to a relationship with me.""
That was too late, I was already in love with her and she was with me.
We had a wonderful, loving relationship, the best one I ever had with any woman.  Fact is, we were deeply in love, however she had difficulty expressing it, however I believed it was because of the guy before me.  She had told me a little bit about that relationship but not a whole lot.  
During our eleven years together, she never showed any sign of this disorder.  She was who she was, the wonderful, loving woman she was from the start...but then, well, after we became homeless in Florida, we moved back to Sacramento.  Her daughter had been a Meth addict for a few years and I guess the availabilty and the desire to do it again got the best of her.  Her first bit was done in October 2018, ok. this is where I get insulted by other people, especially since I had worked for two years as an A/D counselor and ""knew better,"" I decided to give Meth a try.  I basically did because I wanted to see what the appeal it had for her.  I know, my bad, right?
From October to the last week of December 2018, I still didn't see any sort of disorder in her at all.  I did notice she went just a bit crazy when she couldn't find any.  I am leaving out a bit more, right now, when it concerns her attitude about Meth ""as a drug."" It was the first week of Jan 2019 when things got weird. As everybody knows, Meth speeds you up, it also works off of Dopamine and I know what it does.  Yeah, the sex we had at the end of the day was fantastic.  But, not too slowly, it was like a kind of slow WHAM, when we were up all night, she started having what I thought were hallucinations.  She started talking to people who I didn't see nor hear. These were simple discussions which over time got to be rants about them ""not doing"" what they were supposed to do and betraying her.
They got increasingly strange, all involving her ""job"" and ""mission"" in what I started to call her ""mirror-world.""  In her world, it kind of overlaped the real reality.  It was like, well, fibers from this reality were woven with fibers from hers, to create a sort of tapestry. I kind of went along with all of this, I didn't know what else to do.  I did learn, as it progressed why she believed she was, well, what she believed she was, which played into the whole scenaro, and it was increasingly making her angry because these ""others"" were not only betraying her, they were abandoning her as their leader.  I tried to keep her calm when she got into this anger, sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't.  Usually towards the end of the day, around 3am, she was calm, was ""herself"" and in the mood for some intense intimacy.  We'd sleep for about four hours and if she had Meth, it would start up again.  We would do this for a week at a time, then crash for a day or two, then start up again.
It got to the point though, that what usually went on while we were doing the Meth, had seeped into reality. Now this whole time, that is, under Meth, there was already a mix a sort of overlap.  As it continued, for the first month and then the first week of February, a very angry, hateful ""her"" showed up.  She was really hateful and angry, a total opposite of my wife.  I learned what could best be termed ""secrets of her past"" from the one I soon initially called ""the angry alter,"" because by this time I had come to the realization my wife had a non-diagnosed, well, I call it schizophrenia but I don't know. 
My wife was mostly present as herself, I am forced to refer to her as ""my wife"" because she is the one I fell in love with, who loved me and, well, was wonderful.  The other her, the only thing I saw that they shared was a body and certain experiences.  The one I dubbed ""the angry one"" at first didn't show up much, only when my wife seemed tired or frustrated but the angry one would come and go, maybe not ""at will"" though. This is why I thought she was the alter.  I was later to figure out, mainly because the angry one suggested it when we had an arguement, something my wife and I never did.  We had a ""tiff"" or disagreement, I can virtually count on one hand how many times in eleven years.  But with the angry one, it was like every other time she manifested.
During this time, my wife was mostly there and it was always just like all the times, we did the things we always did, we would go places, do things and it was just like normal.  She was who I married, a loving person, totally in love with me and me in her.  But things did change, the more time went on, the more the angry one woud manifest herself.  She started being mean and cruel to me too.  When she did this, after she ""left"" and my wife was there, she had NO idea what had gone on. It was like when an alcoholic blanks out, no real conscious memory of what went on.  I don't think she ever had a conscious memory of what went on when the angry one popped up.
In early March, my wife came to me after going to the landlady's house, who was the mother of this shithead she had been with. In Jan 2018 we were forced to move, we had been homeless for about a year, however we lived with her step-father's mother. When she passed, he lost the house and we had to move.  The ONLY person we knew who could help us was her old friend, the mother of this dick she had been with. I really didn't want to move into the RV, which was parked in the driveway, however we had no alterntives. The first year seemed ok, she was ok, still no manifestation of any kind of disorder, no angry one at all.  It wasn't until Jan 2019, after doiong Meth for two months, did the manifestation happen.  Anyway, my wife came to me in early March. She told me she was really scared of this dickhead.  He had some incredible anger issues, it was pretty easy for him to suddenly flare up for no apparent reason. After being ""yelled at"" and scared by him a few times, she said it started to remind her of when they were together.  Of course it pissed me off, but there was nothing we could do, if we left, we'd be homeless.
For the rest of the time, or at least before the angry one totally took over, she avoided going to their house and avoided him. The ""environment"" changed drastically. I was told by a psychologist that sometimes the environment, especially one which reminds them of their past, especially a violent one, will dredge up the fears they had then, helping to force them to retreat and their disorder would grow worse.  I began to see less of my wife and more of the angry one, who I soon refered to as Vihane.  My wife was my wife up until a few days after my birthday in middle of March. As usual, my wife expressed her love, her hope for the future and declare her love and everything else by writing a letter. Every year on our anniversary she would write, every year on my birthday she would write and sometimes on Valintine's Day.  These were very beautiful letters, they expressed her love in a way which was easier for her to do than vocalize.  I could tell she was in love with me, from these letters.
The last time I was with my wife was about three days afer she wrote the letter. Right up to that day, she was HER, she was my wife, the total opposite than Vihane who was very angry, very hateful and cruel.
Let me skip to what I need some advice on.
In her reality, she believed my ""other me"" was an evil, vile asshole, just like the dickhead.  Soon she was blaming me for the same shit he did...not beating her, I would NEVER do that at all, one who loves as I did, couldn't and wouldn't. But she accused me of cheating on her, the very same thing dickhead did.  And odd, the woman my other-me cheated with, ""looked"" just like the one dickhead cheated with.  One night, probably the first week of April, while yes, doing Meth (it seemed not stop use since early Feb), she suddenly shifted a bit, personality wise.  She looked at me and asked: ""Did you hear her? Did you hear the other people? They are all talking about it, she's right in front of you, can't you see her, can't you hear her tell you what a bastard you are, can't you hear her accuse you of F'ing her? You have been cheating on me.""  To say the least, I was taken aback by this.  Like fuck no, I never cheated on her, how in hell could I cheat with...well, with a person who didn't exist?  Well. she did exist, but in her world, not reality.  Because my her reality and the real reality was like a tapestry, and since there were mirror-people of those she knew in her past there too, it all was totally real to her.  Seriously, I don't know how that works.
At times Vihane was ok, there were times when I thought my wife was back, but it was a lghter kind of Vihane. We even made love many times and I always thought it had been my wife, Vihane didn't really show herself or act like her, except for the rare times when something went wrong with the sex.  Then she flaired up said cruel things, hurt my feelings and suddenly it seemed my wife was back. When we were going to sleep, there she was, curled up with me, cuddling up, just like always.  It was like suddenly Vihane lost wind and power and vanished, but once we were up, my wife was only there for a few minutes before Vihane popped up and we were off on a tangent of her angry, hateful bullshit.  To say the least, I had to walk on eggshells, so to speak around her, anything could set her off on an angry, hateful dirge.
Well, all hell broke loose and she simply forced me away. I had no alternative but to leave.  She had become Vihane ALL the time, even when it was the usual time we made love, she was cold, distant and unfeeling, sometimes downright insulting and making fun of me. Yeah, I knew the difference between her and my wife.  Some three weeks prior to Vihane finally forcing me away we got into an arguement.  I DEMANDED she let my wife come back. I told her, probably not a smart thing, that I knew they were different, that it ""was like"" they were two differnet people.  She laughed at that. She looked straight at me and said: ""I might be able to work miracles, I might have learned how to do all sorts of amazing things, that was what I was supposed to do, that was what I was born to do. To learn the lessons so I could be who and what I am,"" she paused, laughed a lttle then finished with: ""I never learned how to be able to PHYSICALLY divide myself into two separate bodies, nobody, even others like me, on a higher level can't do that.  How do you know that I AM NOT the original?""
Oh shit.  It was then I realized the angry,hateful, cruel one WAS the original and my wife was her alter. I had fell in love with her alter, and her alter had fell in love with me.  For eleven wonderful years, I had been with this most wonderful woman, a polar opposite to Vihane and SHE, my wife had been the damn alter.  What was frighting, was that ONLY with Meth use did my wife share some things in common with Vihane...that being what she really was, well, in the mirror-world.
I felt Vihane would be the one forever, I'd never be with my wife, ever again.  Her disorder had fully manifested itself, kicked off my Meth use, all I could see was Vihane and Meth, forever. As I said, to her, Meth wasn't a drug, it was a ""medicine"" which allowed her, my wife, while she was in her disorder...or maybe in life, I dunno...to feel, both emotionally and sexually.  I could explain that but it would take too much now, let's just say that the reason for the Meth was not only to ""ground"" her, it also allowed her to feel. Earlier, one time in April, she insisted she ""didn't know how to love"" and ""didn't know how to feel""...she needed Meth to ""feel"" not only emotionally but sexual pleasure, which I found bixarre, since my wife was VERY much the emotion type and VERY much the loving one, especially when we made love, which oddly she never called it that...she always called it sex.
Ok, now I gotta skip.
I've been gone for three months. I have not heard from her, period.  Well, Vihane doesn't want anything to do with me, I guess I thretend her existence and her rational.  I was a threat to her mirror-world and all that she was, I think she was fearful that her alter, my wife, would find the strength to force herself into it all and be...the one.  Fuck it sounds as if its some kind of science fiction movie, or something, but it isn't.  The two indidivdul personalties: one Vihane, one my wife---each led a separte existence, went on and had sepearte experiences, wer seperate..""people"" who inhabited the same brain, the same body.  Vihane felt her existence was threatened, not only by my wife who she created as an alter, but also by me, who this alter was totally in love with, thus, I think the combination of fibers from her experience with dickhead and me...forming THAT reality.
I've come to realize, most likely my wife, as she waa, as my wife will never come back, if the environment or reason to feel more at ease and less threatene ever goes away and my wife is ""allowed"" to surface, she won't exactly be the exact personalty. The disorder computer would have reprogrammed her, to  give her some kind of reason why I am not there, in her life.  I don't believe she will ever be my wife again.
Now, see, I was dealing with the silence, not very well though. There are times i go into deep, severe depression. Even with me saying my wife has ""passed"" (in a way she has), doesn't seem to lighten my depression, there's been seveal times I simply couldn't handle it all and, well, felt somewhat suicidal.
AND then...just like when it came to getting back the wedding ring I bought her a couple of years ago, which meant SO much to my wife and SO little to Vihane, who argued they meant nothing, they did not represent anything, they were NOTHING to her, this counters EVERYTHING my wife believed. For her they were a visual representation of her love, my love and ours.  Vihane kept showing up, insulting the whole thing, not caring, putting off going to the pawn shop to get them back, knowing full well the date we had to get them.  She dragged it out until it was too late.  When my wife went to get them and found out it was too late, it was like the world crashed on her, she even cried, something she hardly ever did.  Then, suddenly, Vihane was there, taking over, shutting down everything.  This was about the time she took control.
We lost everything we owned, three years prior, when we couldn't pay for our storage.  We were in Florida, we had our storage in California.  We both begged her daughter to get our stuff and move it.  Every time we sent money to do that, unknown to us, her daughter used the money for drugs.
When we lost our stuff, we both vowed to NEVER let it happen again.
Four years later, a heartless, cold, vindictive hateful Vihane apparently refused to pay the storage and she lost it all.  It puzzels me about it though. LOGICALLY Vihane new she would eventually need what was in the storage, an expensive bed frame and an expensive TV and what we had left.  WHY would she allow it to be lost?  If she finally moved somewhere, she would need that stuff, she would have it to live.  She wouldn't have to ""start over"" with bed frame, tv and the rest of it.  WHY would she get rid of having it, by not paying for it?  I don't get it at all.
For three months, I have no idea what's been going on in her life.  I don't know if she and her daughter have made up and live together, I don't know if she is actually with somebody else, but I kind of doubt it, she ALWAYS told me she was fully able to survive without a man, even sexually, she ""knew how"" to pleasure herself, though a man did help a bit.  Vihane is a total survivor, she will do what she thinks is the best way, but she won't break the law to achieve it.  I doubt she will go against her own ethics to achieve it, nor ""return to Satan's bed"" (dickhead) and ""go backwards"" as she put it, by allowing herself a way out.
I just don't understand it.  I don't know why, even as Vihane, she would allow herself to lose all that suff...UNLESS it is a way to keep my wife in check, but of course my wife doesn't know about losing it all, nor will she ever, I don't think.
This just doesn't make sense to me.  Even if she was to move where she was and into someplace that actully had furniture, she still wouldn't let it go.  Something is wrong.  Something is terribly wrong.
As I said, I could imagine Vihane doing this just to put to rest any kind of emotional attachement to those things, whiich would remind her of the life her alter, my wife, and I had.  Just like the wedding rings.  That was the very first serious thing she did, to destroy some kind of connection, the visible showing of my love for my wife and her for me.  Vihane new their importance to her alter, and then went about, in a fully calculated way to ""lose them."" Did she do the same with our stuff in storage, and what in hell did she do with all my clothes and other things I had no time to get and bring with me?  It seems to me, she is stripping away, removing EVERYTHING which was important to her alter, and to me: she is removing EVERY emotional attachment she can, even the kind we have for such things as wedding rings, beds, a collection of elephants, and ALL the rest.  But what is she doing it for?  Is she clearing it all out because eventually she will submerge and either an altered wife will come back, or possibly a new alter of her will be born?

OR...did that dickhead, in a fit of total anger, for whatever reason, beat her and accidently killed her.  Believe me, I can see it. I can honestly see it.  My wife was afraid of him, with a reason, that is why Vihane was there at times when they were together and then recently.  Vihane knows how to fake it really well, even those idiots can't really tell the difference.  She fully knows how to act like the her alter, like the one she was, when they were all together.  She knows how to fool EVERYBODY because they simply don't know and wouldn't believe in the idea she wasn't herself, or she has a disorder.
I TOTALLY fear for her life.  Both her physical life as well as her emotional and physical life.  Apparently she did too, otherwise why did Vihane ""come back"" when she felt threatened and scared.  The emotional environment changed around March 2019 and that is when Vihane seized everything.  How can it be now that I am gone?  If she has moved, she would still need to be Vihane, at least for a while, and she certainly would need the shit from the storage.  It wasn't as if she didn't have the money to pay for it. She just chose not to.
What with this weird thing happening, with the storage and what it meant to my wife...knowing she had the money to pay, and the vow we both took about not losing it...is it possible I am right and Vihane is doing the same thing as what she did with the ring? Regardless of the fact, when she moves, she has to start over with it...she is trying to divest all of what my wife and I held dear, the emotional ties to THINGS as representatives of our love, of our time togehter...getting rid of it because of what?
OR could my worse fear be true? He killed her and got away with it because she alienated her daughter, got rid of me, alienated her brother, who doen't give a fuck anyway.  If her daughter doesn't even count anymore, another attachment to my wife...I, as an attachment to my wife and the material things: getting rid of everything...which was dear to my wife...why?
It goes beyond my understanding.
Is my wife REALLY passed?  I say she is, because in a way she is.  She's gone, yet the body lives on, but another person is inside of it.
I feel like calling the police and having them do a welfare check. If she is still there, Vihane will do all she can to protect her reality, she will do as she always does: act like my wife, or some other ""self"", it will be a lie, but to her it will be the truth, since it is a part of her reality...and the cops and everybody else will buy into it because she acts so normal, so honest about it...and besides, her truth is a TRUTH to her, so why would she lie about anything, especially the cops. I will explain things to them, but when they talk to her, even if they know the basics...they most likely will buy what she is so honestly standing up for and believe her.
All I want is to know if she is ok and still alive.
Am I doing the right thing, caling the cops for a welfare check or should I just leave it all alone and NEVER know what has happened to her?",multiple-personalities
Newly Diagnosed,"Hi,
   I've been recently diagnosed with C-PTSD and DID I don't have anyway to access or afford the proper counselling that I need to start healing so I'm hoping to get some advice online. I don't really know where to start my healing process so any advice would be apriciated. In June I was admitted to hospital for my mental health and was there for most of the month during my time there I had told my doctor about a voice I had started hearing from time to time in the last four months. This voice was of a female that would say things that helped calm me in situations where I was feeling anxious or overwhelmed and after a few months of hearing her she told me her name was Puala. I also explained some of my other experiences like memory loss, ""waking up"" in places that I didn't know how I got to or even where I was at times, having freinds ask me questions about conversations I would swear never happened and a few other things. After further evaluation I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and DID. During my stay I would keep a journal of the times I lost memory after my doctor diagnosed me they informed me that during the times I recorded loosing memory I would start acting very different, identify with different genders or pronouns, have differnt ages and even different names. I had asked him why this was and what DID is but they replied with ""I don't know enough about it to answer your questions."" A few days latter I was discharged with no answers, out patient resources or counselling. I've finally found a counsellor recently we've only met twice but she told me she has no idea what she's doing with DID and that she only wants to focus on ""my main self"" and that my alters don't matter because it's about me and integration. After she told me this I started to get a feeling that wasn't mine of anger and I started to feel something in my get really defensive. I went in later that week and told her that she wasn't the right fit for me. I'm still experiencing trouble with these symptoms on a daily dases and could really use some kind of support and advice. ",multiple-personalities

New Diagnoses....,"Hi, I haven't been on DS in years but I'm facing a possible diagnosis of DID. I'm 55 and have been in and out of the mental health system for most of my life. For the last 2 decades I've been treated for Bipolar 1, rapid cycling w/ mixed states. I also have PTSD, C-PTSD, Schizoid PD, GAD w/panic, Chronic DP/DR 45+ years history, Dissociative Fugue, Acute Dissociation, AND... Dissociative Amnesia. It's a mouthful.... I, and my previous doctors, dissmissed the idea of DID (I have suspected since 1977) because no one had ever identified an alter even though I do have periods of amnesia that span a few hours to a few years and all of the other relevant symptoms except an alter standing up and saying hello! So my therapist retired and I decided to change pdocs also.... New one, after seeing her for bit over a year, decides that I'm not Bipolar. Nope. She thinks I have ADHD. So she switches up all my meds.... and lo and behold.... I can think. I can sleep. I can breath. But then since I'm not heavily sedated anymore... OMG I can think! OMG the nightmares. OMG the flashbacks. Holy fuck the black-outs... So I'm on a waiting list for the psychologist who specializes in childhood trauma and dissociative disorders. The Pdoc thinks that the correct list of diagnoses should be DID, PTSD, C-PTSD. And maybe ADHD. That sure narrows it down.... I definitely have the childhood for it.... 
Anyway... hi. Thought I'd hang out and see if this feels like where I belong. ",multiple-personalities

I need help,"I've posted a similar post in the PTSD page.
I am seeing a new therapist as the last one caused more trauma. I just got out of the hospital. 24 days in an intensive trauma program that specializes in DID. 
It helped a bit. I spent days on the phone with my insurance company trying to find a new therapist. Then I called them and 98% turned me down because they were either full, had a waiting list, or couldn't treat my DID. I was feeling so helpless. Then I called a trauma specialist intern therapist who doesn't take insurance. She works in a sliding scale. We agreed on $35 a session. Which isn't bad at all! 
I'm on disability and I don't bring in that much money, a little over $700 a month. I get paid at the beginning of each month. I've already paid all my bills and extra stuff that I thought at the time I could afford. Which has now left me with no money. But now I've cut off all the subscription service I had so i can afford her next month. 
I feel very hopeless and helpless! I feel like I'm fighting a war all alone! 
I see her three times before I get paid again. I've quit my subscriptions to save money so I can afford her next month. 
I help others at every cost I can regardless of them being able to help me back out or not. 
My family is very unsupportive and toxic. I moved 500 miles away to start my life over and get away from all that toxicity.  
I need help and I don't know who or where else to turn to.  I'm on my knees begging and pleading for your help. I just want to see a therapist. Is that too much to ask? 
I'm really freaking out. My DID system isn't staying calm anymore. My destructive parts are very strong and are being very bad. They are influencing me to hurt myself. It's really hard not to give in.
I also think who cares? Why should a therapist care? I just don't understand why life has to hurt so bad? 
All I want is to see a therapist. Is that too much to ask? 
I'm begging for help with money to pay her.

Lost Time for the first time...,"Hi there!
I have been aware of parts within myself and many dissociative symptoms but have always said I have DDNOS (dissociative disorder not otherwise specified) because I'd never lost time or seen evidence of parts coming out at all, with or without my knowledge.
The morning of New Year's Eve I was talking with my roommate and she said she heard me talking in two different voices, arguing with myself, in the middle of the night.  She told me just because she wanted to make sure I realized I was using two different voices.  I thought we were talking about a different time and then things weren't really making sense and I said, ""When was this?"" ""4AM"".  I have no recollection of that.  ""Oh God."" was my response.  Anywho, I've been looking for a new therapist anyway, but now I'm desperate to find someone who understands dissociative disorders and has worked with parts before.  I'm currently inpatient (I didn't want to take any chances) but they are looking at a discharge date of Tuesday, Jan 8 and I'm like ""Not without a therapist appointment scheduled!""  
I live near Worcester, MA.  I prefer somone within half an hour of my home, but I may be able to see someone up to an hour away, if I can work out getting a ride.  I do have people at McLean Hospital looking for someone for me, and have reached out to every other contact I can think of who may know someone.
Thanks for listening!

"Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.","This is a general message I am posting to all of the groups I belong to:
I just thought back to when I first found DS soon after it first began and what a different life I had then.  It is much better now, mainly because I have my own apartment as opposed to living in an old travel trailer in somebody's driveway. But even that could have been much worse than it was.  I have been here now since Nov. of 2009 and a lot has happened.  I had a relationship with a man who I connected with like I've never connected with anyone else and doubt I ever will.  Unfortunately although we both battled his severe addictions, he passed away on 9/11/2015.  Since then I have been picking up the pieces and collecting myself to recover from that, losing my oldest son to suicide in 2005, and a miriad of other assorted issues that got shelved and not specifically dealt with along the way in my past and since.  All along I have not been able to find effective resources or solutions to my many ""deep seated"" issues until last year when I found The Tapping Solution on Facebook.  I have spent the last year working on it here and there and this year it is congealing into something solid for me to work with.  Last year when I first discovered it, they were just about to have their 10th annual summit and now getting ready for their 11th one. 
*A note to those in the Bereavement group and others in intense acute pain at the moment:  While this method is effective, please don't expect it to take away all the pain you are feeling immediately. Just as with any physical wound, it takes time for emotional wounds to heal as well.  But this will undoubtedly be helpful to calm your nerves and ease your pain. 
Here is some info about it in case you are interested:
EFT tapping, AKA, Emotional Freedom Technique tapping, involves tapping on a series of certain meridian points on your body while speaking through certain issues you focus on in order to identify and release the negative emotional charges that get stored in your body that can cause stress and pain, and blocks your normal energy flow in your body which can also make you feel tired and sluggish. I started doing it about a year ago when they had their 10th annual summit, and they are getting ready to do their 11th one starting February 25th. They have many people endorsing it, some of whom I was familiar with before I discovered this program, like Dr. Wayne Dyer and Dr. Christiane Northrup who I've seen on OPB, and Iyanla Vanzant who I saw on Oprah years ago when she had her show.
I have been working on it here and there throughout the year and am looking forward to this year's summit. It is structured in such a way that for 10 days, you get an email with a link to several video options you can choose from to watch as many as you want to on different aspects and topics to choose from.  You don't have to watch them at a specific time, you will have 24 hours between each emailing to watch the previous days' videos.  The summit is a great way to learn about how it all works and the different types of styles you can use.  You will need to sign up if yoou want to participate.  If you're interested, check it out here:

Tough session **possible TW**,"Sup guys I’m Brenda I’m 15. I’m out to give S a break. She had a really hard T Appt. We was raped in January & hav had horrific flashbacks. S did ALOT of flashback work this evenin. She never talked out loud bout it till now. T said that talkin about it what happened would lessen its power it would get the flashes out of our head & give the memories to her so we can let it all go. So S did it!! She talked about the beginning  middle & end in detail!! It was sooo hard to do & soooo horrific!! I helped her som specially when she started reliving it & our T was so Awesome reminding us it’s not happenin now we are safe & in her office. 
Our T also walked us through an exercise for when we are triggered & go back to this & other situation. We go to our fav store & can spend hours there can pick a suit a magical suit that is made just for us it covers us head to toe & gives us surrenity & protects us even if we are triggered into flashbacks nothing can hurt us nothing can touch us. And we are not afraid and are at peace. If we start having body memories & are in pain down there we put our magical suit on.

Finding out the puzzle pieces of my childhood,"Hey I was diagnosed with DID over a year ago. Have met a lot of my people (personalities). 
I have also been learning about what happened in my childhood & I am sure there is a lot more to learn. I have always had gaps no memory like missing puzzle pieces of my childhood & wanting to have the whole puzzle put together. 
Either through my people journaling in their journals or coming out in therapy & talking to my therapist. Little girl age 5yrs. has shared about the S abuse that happened at the hands of our bio D (our father) it’s to hard to call him our father so we call him bio D. Suzie age. 12yrs has shared he S abuse that happened to her & today in therapy I learned through my therapist that someone new had come out no name yet but she is 8 or 9yrs. & she shared some detailed S abuse that was disturbing. 
Sorry for the long post but I guess just wondering if anyone can relate in that I feel so... disconnected like all this stuff happened to them not to me. But they are me... and I don’t know what to do with this info. 
I feel like maybe I need to connect that this happened to me & have feelings about it? So I can work through it and heal?I guess it’s also hard to believe that this all really happened... I don’t know it’s all really overwhelming and confusing to have no memory of all this. But I know that’s exactly why I have DID is because it was to painful to live through so I split.

Therapist interacting with my alters 1st time,I was diagnosed with DID a while ago but have avoided dealing with it.  I was in residential treatment for my eating disorder when I got the diagnosis.  I have just started in trauma therapy now that the eating disorder is stable. My therapist interacted with one of my alters for the first time.  I absolutely freaked me out.  That is not an accurate description of how I feel but it was unnerving.  I don't know that I can go back for more therapy.  My husband and friend both say they have interacted with the same alter but I have no memory of that.  This time I was observing the conversation from a distance.  Do others feel almost violated as people you know or care about you interact with an alter for the first time?,multiple-personalities
Advice telling others you have DID," DID is something that you can't hide. It will show, and from what I learned that you can chose to reveal, or not to reveal that you have DID according to the interaction you have with individuals. I tell  my doctors I have DID because I'm not always in control my consciousness are present. I shared with my family , and received acceptance, plus rejection over it. My husband abandon our 23 year relationship, my mother stopped talking to me because she couldn't cope with the others, my youngest daughter accepted me, while my  oldest daughter tolerates the others, my son was conflicted, and one of my sister 's acts like we are on pretend time. ( meaning it's not real but she will play, while clinging to the notion that she as well as others believe that I 'm crazy.) 
That being said , I'm fearful of talking to people in public, due to the different consciousness, each one has a different voice. My voice box was in pain for many months. I'm fearful of talking on the phone. I do those things by telling individuals up front. 
Have DID isn't shameful, I'm teaching myself daily. I believe that their is a reason for everything, and my consciousness flooded to me because 80percent of my body was in pain, and I kept having a series of TIAs, which are mini strokes, and these strokes locked my body preventing me from moving.
so you decide if you want to tell someone, or keep it to yourself, but the one thing I learned is that the personalities will make themselves known any way.

Similar things happen to me," When my consciousness started flooding in I became severely ill. I started having migraines, noise sensitivity, convolutions,  manyTIA(mini stroke)attacks, hallucinations, body weakness, constant pain in 80% of my body, couldn't walk so times, and a lot of other things. What I did was research my symptoms so I would have some type of clue about what could be happing to me, than I went to various doctors. As you separate each of you illnesses there is a possibility that you can eliminate a few of them. In term of vitamin deficiencies lack of certain ones can put the body through duress. I lacked the right amount  potassium in my system and had symptoms like I was having a heart attack, at the same time I lacked vitamin D and gained twenty pounds in about eight weeks. I also learned that sugar, and flour products can cause my body to become affected with illness which results in some times  awful headaches,and contribute to other troubles in my body.
I've been dealing with many illnesses along with DID, what I learn is that I have to be pro active about my health, because doctors will only do so much for you. If you can improve some small things like eating right, excerise if you can, and eliminate toxic things it may help.

I don't know what else to do,"Hello
I know it has been some time since I've posted. Right now I am so sick and it seems like nobody either can or is willing to help me. I am hoping that I can get some suggestions or insights or something. 
It began with tremors, I think, shaking like I was cold even if I wasn't. Dizziness, more confusion than usual. Then bouts of slurred speech, headaches, occasional bloody noses. I ended up at the ER. Not a stroke, not an anuerym, not my heart, not MS. My EKG, MRI, bloodwork was perfect as usual. Follow up CT scan perfect too. 
But, I still get tremors, horrible headaches (which I haven't had in years) and sometimes I swear I can feel there is something in there even though I know that is completely irrational. I'm exhausted and in pain (even if I take my meds), deep dark circles under my eyes, dry heaving, one minute my face is burning like its on fire, the next my body is so cold my teeth chatter and I can't find enough blankets to warm me. I get dizzy and feel like I'm going to pass out a lot. After that I'm really tired and kinda spacey. 
Now my husband and I are arguing all the time, me and my kids too. I keep having panic attacks out of the blue and I swear the world is going to shatter if I don't get these certain things done. And in my head I hear that nagging voice telling me horrible things and she won't stop. I keep finding little fingertip bruises, I know they're from clenching or grinding. I have nightmares all the time. And I'm terrified. I'm terrified to tell my husband what is going on. He knows about my condition, but I can't tell him, we're already arguing.
And then it stops. All of the sudden and I think I'm ok and everyone loves me again. But then it starts back up at any moment. I don't drink alcohol or use drugs or do anything high risk, I barely leave the house. But the physicians can't find a physical issue and my psychiatrist just writes another prescription. Here's what psych meds I'm on now :
Elavil
Cymbalta
Paxil
Provigil
Xanax
I try not to take the Provigil or Xanax unless I have to.

"My lover's alter is Homicidal. Please, advice","My relationship is beautiful with my lover, at times so heavy. We are open about their DID and my BPD (borderline personality disorder), and they have expressed that they believe there is only three of them. My question is, can there be an alter that the Host and Others aren't aware of?
They all tell me they love me and trust me, the other question that I can never seem to ask them.. can one alter get jealous of the other? 
Back to the other possibly 'unknown' alter.. he is homicidal. He says that the most passionate act of love is stabbing your lover to death. I woke up this morning from a dream that my lover stabbed me, and ironically this alter confessed that he woke up in the night, stood over me while I slept.. with a butcher knife, contemplating my murder. He said he saw the pictures on my wall and put the knife back, then began to laugh and apologise for ""almost murdering "" me. 
I continued to talk to him about it, but this alter left.. now I was talking to who I am normally with in the outside world, the host,  and he said I was scaring him. I told him I understand and I love him but there is a part of him that may need attention. These people are my best friends, my lovers, and my family. I love them so much but even I dissociate and change having borderline personality disorder,  and it becomes very overwhelming and confusing when I can't tell if I am safe. There have been a dozen times over the past couple years where I have had to hide knives in the house because I am not sure if this alter is with me at some points, or what his intentions are.
Does anyone here have a homicidal alter? How do you talk them down , do you remind them of repercussions? Do you tell a doctor? How can I be supportive?
..Also none of them have told me their names, other than the Host. What is a safe way to ask their names with out scaring or offending?

I have recently found a relatively new ""thing"" going around called EFT, Emotional Freedom Technique, or just, ""tapping"" for short. I have found it to actually be helpul in areas where my medications and endless hours of psychotherapy have not been. It seems to be a way of making connection with my issues that have been blocking my path to a relatively normal, funtional life of some kind. I first heard about it on OPB. And since then a whole movement has developed that I have just now started to get involved with. It is called, ""The Tapping Solution"" created by Nick Ortner and his sister, Jessica. It has been developed over the course of 10 years and has been endorsed by several professionals, including Dwayne Dyer (who has passed away in August of 2015) and Dr. Christiana Northrup. Both of them I have also seen on OPB, and enjoyed what they had to say, so I am pretty solidly convinced this is a real deal. I am now into my third week of their money-back guaranteed 7-week program and so far so good with the results. There's tons of information on their website for free, so in case you're interested, here's a link if you'd like to check it out: https://www.thetappingsolution.com/.  I hope this is helpful!!

it would just mean someone would say they were willing to hop on the site for a little while once a week.  it may be too hard to do this but sign up if you are willing:

Helping Alters understand what is important.,"My alter, such in such was triggered back to a time where they exposed an explaination on what it means to reply and demand.   In our daily meetings, we just discussed being present what might be important and also doing sort of like inventory.   We are in discovery, so basically how can I get him/her to tolerate the noise even though his job might only be in the moment to remind.  Yea, I want him to be comfortable saying names him/her what I noticed is also being comfortable just being apart how he got to be also the dp/dr if it was in far off place not present but only heard.  I told him about APN and all the alter types he can have his idea of being normal but anytihng in two isn't at some point in time he can say I witness was reshared to about the trauma, so I'm not as APN as you might think.   So in our internal group meetings I want to know what was your day like, that you arent sleep stuck in or some place deeply hiding away.  If your day was only a gesture at honking car then I'm fine to understand what you anticipated of my temperament and some of the reasons of the present  for the honking car",multiple-personalities

Is this par for the course?,"The last few days I've felt great and clear headed. But then I realized that when I'm stressed that's when I can't seem to keep control, the world gets fuzzy, my head is noisier, I lose time. This last year I've  stopped drinking alcohol (though I only drank occassionally), forgetting to take my meds, I created all these systems to put me back on track when I fell off, even writing sticky notes and texts to well myself, anything I can think of to help. 
I've said before that I haven't researched DID much. Which is unusual for me, but I know who's resisting and we're trying to overcome that. But is this par for the course? For much of my youth I used mimicry and isolation to hide my condition. Which is fine when you grow up in the environment that I did, moving from town to town, school to school, a neglectful mother and string of abusive men. But I have a spouse and children now, a much different life. My husband knows everything and we promised to do better by our kids and one another. 
Example, I lost a significant amount of weight a couple of years ago and plateaued ever since. I began getting a lot of attention when say I was alone at the store. Something in me panicked and I hit a block, had a breakdown, I haven't got back to it since. 
So will this always be the case? My doctor said we have to learn to work together but I don't know where to begin. ",multiple-personalities

Missing Alter with a New One?,"Hi,
I am a new alter, I think. I’m not entirely sure but I seem to have a complete different personality from the others but I’m not sure if it’s an extension of another personality or not. 
As for the other part, I seem to be missing an alter too? My alter, Defense (as I call her), hasn’t been here for a month or so and I’m not sure what happened.

Newbie here,"Hi,
I have been diagonsed for 7 years DID.   A very interning journey I have been on.  Had a counselor tell me I was healed and believed it until I couldn’t keep it together anymore.   Finally after 4 years of believing and acting healed.  I am accepting I am DID and the alters and my life of this is real.   This counselor was wrong and my alters were afraid of her and just wanted to stop seeing her.   We did and have not gone back to anyone and won’t.   
I knew over the last years the alters were there, I was afraid to admit it and allow them to come out.   Now that I have my mind is calmer in some ways, and in some ways not.
It is like I am starting over again.   Depression has hit hard this time and I don’t want to leave my house or see anyone.  I do have my husband and brother in the same house, or small apartment.   I thankfully am home alone during the day.  I can’t be around people, the anxiety is way to much for me.   

Anyway, look forward to learning and seeing what connections come.",multiple-personalities
Sudden turn of events.," Well today is one for the record books For me.  I got kicked out of the partial hospitalization program I was in because I am letting another patient/really good friend live with me for the time being. He’s just couch hopping And my couch happened to be the next on his list. I thought I was doing a good thing by letting him stay with me. And he thought he was helping me out by being here and helping me not be all alone. Apparently there is a rule  that patients can’t live with other patients while doing the program. I got 1 treatment day in. 1. Im such a fuck up! 
I’m at a loss as to what to do now? Im suicidal still, my dissociation is out of control. No one understands that! And Im scared. There is so much inturption in my system that PPW hardly understands nor can she deal with the chaos safely. PPW wants to self harm, or cut badly. 
My back is all out of whack. I have important dr appointments I need to make and attend. 
I really think I need to give my friend a 48hr notice of eviction. Hes really not helping me. If anything hes making things worse for me. But i dont know how to tell him that? I am done letting people take advantage of me. I need to focus on me and not be dissociating into another alter to deal with him and his drama. I havent been PPW all day long. And that scares me. Im Suzie btw. 
Im so tired but this darn steroid pack the ER gave me is keeping me up at night, making me super moody and irritable and increasing my need to binge. I finally got my pain pills today. So thats 1 good thing. 
PPW, me, all of us are so tired!  If i could get a good 8-10hr sleep in i think it would really help. But im barely getting 5hr at best. 
What am i doing to myself? I feel awful! Absolutly awful!!!!  Ugh i hate me, PPW and all of us.  Im so lost and confused, really scared, helpless and hopeless.  Should i go back inpatient? Idk. PPW is just a fucked up crying mess. 
Help, please!!

Pain and Lonely,"ok so today is rough.  Well most days are, but I am in so much body pain today it is hard to move.   Also I feel extra lonely.  I usually like to be alone, but today I just want someone to understand the body pain.    It seems I am always helping out someone yet when I need help no one is around to do so.  I am thankful to have a supportive husband, but he works and can not help me during the day time.   
My body pain seems to get worse not better even though I do what I can to help it.  
Also stressful is searching for a new doctor.   Ug, the one I have is horrible.  She won’t listen to me and  spends 5 minutes with me and when I ask a question you would think I am asking for world peace. 
So there is my ramblings for the days. My parts just want to hide and run away.   I have to stay focused not to do that again.  We have an agreement with my husband we won’t leave the state, but that’s all We want to do is run and hide today. ",multiple-personalities

I have been diagnosed with DID several years ago, but have basically ignored it since I just didn't want to deal with it. But lately, I have been developing more and more triggers for the other ""me's"" to try and get out. Especially in grocery stores.
To give som ehistory on my diagnosis, I have no idea what caused it. For the simple fact that I don't remember anything before November 11, 2000. I was born in 1989. The first 11 1/2 years of my life are gone, and ever since I woke up I have noticed the other me's inside me, though I never recognized them until I broke my friend's arm. Which I only know I did because I came to holding my friend's arm as he was screaming that I just broke it. This was the first time I fully recognized there were others.

The thing i am trying to say is,I don't know if I am the real me, or just a figment of a broken child's mind or imagination.",multiple-personalities

What helped me integrate,"I wrote this in the responce to K2sharps question in my last post and I thought it might be helpful to all of us with DID.
I learned in the process of integration that healing the personalities and the traumas that I experienced, which created them, could not be done a lone. I worked with a therapist going on 10 years now. But most of all I included the grace of God to sustain me.
I've learned that I could not attain down time on my own without my personalities. I prayed a lot and asked God to comfort me in my panic in order to have down time. Believe me it was not an instant miracle of healing and sometimes I did not believe He was even interested in healing me, but my faith in God had to develop in time to trust in Him and believe that He truly was with me and He was the strength to get me through this. My own strength was not enough. My own strength relied on me and my personalities to manage life, which prevented me from really living. 
I did rely on the strengths of my personalities when they were integrated. Their strengths became mine. As they became part of me, one by one, I was able to embrace their strengths and allow them to help me through each step of the way for the others, but it was the grace of God that orchestrated it all.
So today, in the quiet moments in my mind, I thank God. In the panic times I know that He loves me and wants only good for me in my life and it is through Him only that I can feel the peace. All the traumas that happened to me was due to the evil that is in the world. God cannot and does not have the power to change a man's will, but what He does promise is to be there for us through the trauma and bring the healing.
Now, by His grace I will be able to learn how to live as me. Yes, it is scary and I still do have panic attacks and want to switch, but now instead I turn to God for help to get me through those rough patches. I may complain in the midst of it, but in the end I know where my help comes from.
God bless you!",multiple-personalities

I do miss them, but I am happy that I do not lose time any more nor is there confusion in my head and in my life any more. However, I am having problems dealing with life on my own. I used to automatically switch to different personalities to avoid dealing with triggers, stressors and fears... but now I have to deal with it on my own. This is not easy.

Something to try....EVERYBODY!!!,"Hey guys!
I want to send you all a gift.
Imagine i have just given you a present.  You already know what it is because you told me what you wanted. It's something you are really excited about, something that makes you happy.  It's a little something that you could probably get yourself, but there is always something more important that you need, so you keep putting this off. 
It's something for fun, and something that relaxes you, and something that makes you feel amazingly loved.
Whatever that thing is, it's inside this gift.  so open it up, pulling off the ribbon on the box, then the outer paper.  Then take the lid off the box, and pull back the tissue paper.  and see this small gesture of love. and give it to yourself. And feel how lovely it is to have just the right thing given to you.  And realize that the person getting this gift is important, and loved, and beautiful.  
And then do this again at some point for another person in your system.  And then another.

Now one thing that has greatly confused me is that more than 2/3 of alters have been basically erased, if there were 15+ of us, we have been reduced to 5. Is this a serious issue? The 5 of us that were left are the strongest, but that is the only logical reason I can come up with. I did manage to make an appointment with a specialist, but I don't know if I should be worried of so many changes happening to the mind at once. ",multiple-personalities
Newbie here,"Greetings all.  I'm a newbie here.  I have Complex PTSD, DID, Major Depressive Disorder, Major Panic Disorder, bouts of SI and SH.  With this said, it was about 10 years ago I was diagnosed with having the Disassociated Identity Disorder aka, multiple personalities. I find this difficult to believe at times and just wonder if it's others in my life that are losing it but thenI begin to believe it may be true when I have time lapses, hours, days, months and even years without memory or memories that I can't place and seem unrelated to me or when I find I have written in different handwriting styles or languages even, dressed in things I'd never wear, etc.  At time's it feels like I'm losing my mind. It seems my personalities have numbers representing their ages assigned to them rather than names. They are both male and female. They only recently, began to make themselves known to me, in a way I can only describe as being out of my body watching someone else control it and take charge it.  Even though I've had this diagnosis for 10 years, it feels very new to me and frightening.  I feel like I'm going crazy and out of control. Or like a con even for I question all of this being real.  I often question reality.  Anyhow, thank you all for welcoming me into your group.",multiple-personalities
Scared.,"i'm scared. so scared. 
the week before last I had an anxiety attack that lead to an almost mental break.
then two days ago.... i hallucinated. I've always seen moving shadows, especially at night, but never had a full on hallucination. I'm talking my face....tured into a living picasso painting. half of it just slid down, almost like it was melting. I also kept hearing people call my name even when no one had... I havn't had that happen in over a year. 
the only reason i didn't freak out was fiona was walking me through the whole thing, protecting me from the fear and reassuring me that what i was seeing wasn't real. 
I have bipolar, but hallucinations with that are very rare and usually only happen when Manic. 
i'm scared. 
I have a doctor who prescribes my pills, but he isn't theraputic. I can't afford to go back to therapy. 
If it happens again, i'll talk to him about it... 

I've also become aware via friends that I have gaps in memory. I have no recollection of a particularly important conversation or of certain actions. Fiona has never taken memories before... and again: i'm scared. ",multiple-personalities

So we all know how damn slow and quiet this site is.
Booooo
Is anyone interested in taking watcher shifts??
Like, say I'm the Saturday or Monday person. I would commit to being on here that day and I would be available to respond to newbies, answer questions, post stuff etc oin case anyone was in need of chatting or interaction. Someone else would be a different day. 
I am usually only on here during weekends. My rpteam gets really active after being on here and I'm on the road during the week so its kind of a safety thing for me to stay off during the week. But I could definitely be on here regularly on sat.

It sounds embarrassing coming out of my mouth and then I'm all squeamish and little like I've done something wrong
Is this how other people feel about their conditions? If someone has diabetes or cancer or whatever, so they feel shame every time they mention it to a stranger or friend?

something good I want to share,I have a new doctor who has been managing my meds and everything since my actual diagnosis five months ago. I see him once a week and at the end of our appointment today he asked me to just talk to him about anything I want. He finds my DID fascinating but he seems to still see the person behind the diagnosis and I think he actually genuinely likes me as a person too. Trusting people doesn't come easy to me but trusting doctors is even more difficult since one of my past abusers was my Dad and he was a doctor. I trust this doctor and not only that I can genuinely say he makes me feel more comfortable in my own skin knowing I have to share my life with my alters until I can finally make all of us one whole again. Today I was here all day long. I have no lapses and I've managed my triggers without losing grip of myself staying here. I just had to share the impact that this kindness has had on me. Even if nobody reads this it's out there. He even promised to read a book I'm going to give him that has helped me to get through tough times and cope with living with mental illness. This girl Jenny Lawson writes about her mental illness and uses her humor to cope just like I do so it's been something I've reached for when I needed a pick me up and my Doctor is actually going to read it just because I suggested it. I'm happy and shocked lol,multiple-personalities

I don’t know how to title this,"I’m Shai  I am not the main personality, as much I wish I was the main personality I’m not 
  Kaylee is the main personality 
I was made when Kaylee was 9 years old 
Kaylee was abuse, physically, mentally, and emotionally. His name is Robert and he made me, I remember it like it was yesterday. 
 Kaylee’s mom found about me when Kaylee was in middle school. She sent Kaylee to tharpy and mental doctors they didn’t believe us and diagnosed Kaylee with PTSD, Social Phobia, and anxiety. After that I went in hiding. Kaylee locked me away shortly after that. When she was in middle school I don’t know how she did it, but she did. The last thing I remember was being in middle school the next thing I know I am laying next to a man not knowing who he was and where I was. He knew who I was, he believed me, he believed in me. After a while he fell in love with me and Zachary and Kaylee all got married. Hard as it is, there’s a lot of fighting and crying but we make it, u feel like he’s getting sick of it, of me. I feel like if we had to choice one of us he would choice Kaylee no questions. 
After the ordeal with the doctors we have all been afraid to speak out again the doctors made us feel crazy. I am not crazy. I breath, bleed, cry and laugh. Zachary says we laugh, cry, kiss, dress different. We believes us, I don’t know about Kaylee but it makes me feel less crazy. Kaylees family don’t believe me, they believe the docs, well he mom don’t shes at a toss up between us

We are all different from eachother but we are a family and I love them all. Even M. She is a grumpy pants. We have only told one person in our personal lives about us, but she doesn't talk about it. We understand it's something that is hard to understand for people who don't have it, but it still stings a little. People always call us Liz no matter who is ""out"" it hurts us cuz we are here too. Liz feels guilty about it and i love her for that. We all have our fights with eachother. (cough cough M cough cough). This is our first time confessing stuff like this and it feels good.

Like in art class right now we were assaigned a self portrait. Liz refused to do her face cuz she said it wouldnt capture all of us in one look. We have a flag with a special design on it now instead, but it brings up the point of people not knowing we may be in the same body, but we are all different.

I had an episode... and I need someone.,"So, precurser.... Jimmie is my boyfriend. Cory is his roomate. Fiona is my alter. 

so i had an episode last night... unprovoked, I switched over to Fiona - hard core. I forgot just how fully liberating is it to be her. To give zero fucks. To feel powerful. Like i could take on the world and make it kneel.it was aso a bit alarming. I forgot also that when in full swing she can be quite destructive. Thank goodness Cory was there last night because when she/i pulled up,  i was ready to dominate. She/I wanted to sink my nails into jimmie and ... just revel in  the power. She is fae and she wanted to remind him of what kind of creature he keeps in his company.it reminds me why i use to be afraid of her. As exhilarating as it is to be her... if she acted on her impulses and desires I fear for those around.  I'm kind of glad cory was there because it made her behave and hold back.I miss it. as soon as the percentages shifted back into my favor I was left with the stark differences between us. I was suddenly vulnerable and weak. Her strength and lack of fear (of anything...) was gone. I am a pale blue in comparison to her brilliant red.Jimmie was great. He just rolled and went with it. He could tell as soon as I walked up that I was Fiona, and he acted accordingly... wrapping around her, covering her shoulders in small adoring kisses.
When she takes over and drives, i am alarmed, like riding a roller coaster... I am afraid for my friends but .... I miss it as soon as the ride is over.And I know she wouldn't severely harm anyone... it would cause trouble for me. But... gods above. 
I was messed up for like an hour as the percentages in my brain were going haywire. I didn't recognize my reflection. Its like that weird space in-between selves.... where I'm not one or the other... i'm not even a mix of both... i'm neither, almost an empty husk of a person.... I wished more than anything that there was a support group in my home town, because i suddenly felt so alone. so scared and pathetic.

Meanie Doctors,"Ummm
I have an issue with doctors.
I ... so I had to see a new doctor today. Just a phys doc, not a shrink or therapist, which I haven't had in a good 10 years maybe. But I have problems with doctors.
I noticed when I was in my 20s that I could fool therapists.  They would ask how I was and I would be FUCKED but manage to convince them that I was fine just ""stressed"".  I don't trust well, and I always thought if they couldn't figure out that something was wrong then I wouldn't bother to tell them 
On that might be a particular person I am not on a name basis with yet. She ... She maybe lies about shit.
So when I go to doctors I'm really amped up, because A.  I have a hard time talking about my condition and B. they usually treat me so clinically and indifferently that it makes me feel like I've done something wrong, and then I get nervous and switchy, and then I am apt to not tell all the stuff I need to tell, like I had an allergic reaction to something, or a medicine makes me jittery.
So today I got pissed at my new doctor and sort of  maybe behaved badly, but I was angry!  And it has made my whole day jangly and upsetty, except that I had a GREAT workout due to the amped energy.

I cant convince myself otherwise. I've spent half of my life in therapy. I believe God created everyone with a plan and purpose. I have the ability to see good in everyone. I try hard to help everyone because everyone deserves good things and to be happy and I don't want others to feel the lonely awfulness of not mattering. I always end back at believing I am the exception to all of that. It doesn't apply to me. I can't make myself believe that I deserve the same things in life that everyone else has a right to. I can't feel it or get it no matter how hard I try.

Dyslexia,"It seems silly to me that I would be upset about having dyslexia when I have to deal with DID, but it really upsets me sometimes.  Read!lly, I think the issue for me is that my brain is like a really bad friend...I feel it is disloyal, completely unreliable and a pain in the ass.
I recently was trying to say the word Ponytail and said instead Ptonyhail.  Ridiculous. I mean, its funny, but it creeps me out a little that my brain fucks up the simplest things and does these switcheroos on me without me knowing.

"""They are all part of you""","OK so my mom - who has gone further than some peoples parents,and has actually read a book about DID, but likely still does not really UNDERSTAND.  She said to me recently THEY ARE ALL YOU.   Meaning all of my personalities.
Which made me mad because she is right and wrong.
These personalities I have all share the same body. And they are all part of my system. But they are not all ME.  
My body is not all the same. Everything about my body is not just legs, and I feel like she thinks like some doctors out there do, that I am just a person who is maybe overactive in their imagination, and if I tried hard enough I would sort out and become normal.
But it doesn't FEEL that way to me. It feels like some of my other persons are clear across the world.I have to leave a note like a grocery list of thoughts, hopping I might get some information about the person who pushes us down the stairs, and what can she do for fun besides that please? Or the one who feels she is being video taped and monitored, how can I help her and what does she need to feel safe, because I'm not even sure I can understand her language. She is way more like the homeless people I run into than other parts of me. But I was homeless for a while so maybe she really is.
Ugh, sorry this has turned into more of a journal entry than a post,but it feels so weird to try to talk to my unknown selves like a penpal I am hoping will write back.  So no, mom,it isn't all just me.

I don't know, is MPD/DID a mental illness or personality disorder? Or both!?

On track...hopefully,"Finally had a breakdown/confrontation with my therapist. Despite how that might initially sound it was more positive than harmful. The hypno therapy had been getting us nowhere, and for months he'd say things like ""come back ready to work"", and it would eat at me because at no point had he ever successfully hypnotized me. I would supplement with a meditative state (self induced) with him as a ""guiding"" factor. When I told him this he seemed taken aback for a moment, but also like a bulb had come on for him, and he'd admitted that in his 30 years of working with patients (specializes in DiD) that I've been the hardest patient he's ever tried to put under. Once I  explained prior personal conditioning we arrived at a bit smoother process. I'm still a bit terrified of all of this to be honest, but sessions finally seem to be yielding solid results. Our last session he asked me to use my meditation method to relax and just work with what came, and we made more progress than we have in two years. So, feeling a bit relieved. Downside, were now aware of another alter, making me 2 shy of being ""complex"". He seems to believe that I have the complex variation but doesn't want to assume anything until confirmation is possible. Standing count is 7, 5 male, 2 female, 2 of which are children (have not ""surfaced""). Turns out I am familiar with the newest discovery, relatively I suppose, we had met through a series of recurring dreams (I don't dream, so when I do it sticks out). I had brought them up when I had began my therapy and we never addressed it post diagnosis. Has anyone ever experienced/met an alter in a dream state before? While my diagnosis suggests my split began around age 10 or younger, Ive only been being treated for the last 3 years or so.

Do we have the ability not to switch?,"I would like to address an issue that has haunted me for a while now...Do I have the ability not to switch? 
I have been with my therapist for 9 years. We have worked really hard to show love to my personalities and to find healing for each of them. In the end we have integrated 11 of us. However, there is still one that is with me. I switch to her when circomstances get too difficult for me to handle.
My terapist brought to my attention that I switch to avoid responsabilities for taking care of myself. She said if I stay present we could deal with what I am trying to run away from. She said that if and when I stay present around people it's an act of respect and caring enough to be with them fully instead of givng them a part of me.
I have been trying to stay present, but it's torturing me. I'm not ready to give up that personality yet. I wrote an e-mail to my therapist explaining that.

Vulnerability vs Exposed,"Just spent a few hours with a good friend.
He is someone I can talk to about so many things and we have been good friends for several years.  Only fairly recently I opened up about my DID and I have felt weird since.
He isn't treating me differently, but I am sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop. He says real friends accept you for who you are. He probably means that and maybe does accept me with this condition.
But nowbi feel weak in front of him. I feel shy and a bit shameful and today I struggled because alters wanted to come out, and someone did four a minute, but I was too scared for him to see me like that so I made it stop. 
I don't know what to do. I wanted to work on my intimacy with people and have let myself be open with him but really I just don't trust people around my alters.  I am protective of them even though they want to come out and meet people sometimes or interact.

Amnesia,"So I'm reading through parts of Stranger in the Mirror, by Marlene Steinberg.
I know I've been DX with DID. I've accepted that. I'm trying to deal with it in my rather half.hearted, layman's fix it yourself way. 
I've talked with my sister, friends, co.workers about a little bit of this. Some people know or at least have been told (big difference) that I have a swiss cheese brain.
I'm not sure then why I always react so strongly and negatively when it comes to amnesia.
I know it is a part or can be a part of this condition. I know I have experienced it. I don't know why my reaction to hearing about amnesia, or reading about DID makes:
my body heat up. me feel nervous, anxious, defensive. me feel fearful or apprehensive. me feel on edge. me confused and forgetful.
Its ... my friend has diabetes. He has to take insulin. When he he to take it, he doesn't freak out and get all shamed and nervous. I don't know why I do.
I have accepted this diagnosis for years, just can't figure why it always causes a flight reaction in me....unless I still have people that haven't accepted it.

A strange thing happened when i fell asleep,"New here so before i get into my post let me intorduce myself, My name is Matthew. And as of yet I have 9 alters or as they like to be called Legions, let me begin. 
Kaine(Main alter) Has been around since the beginning when i was 4, age 40""T"" My four year old alter also been around sine the beginning.TJ Dalton, showed up after I was punched in high school which gave me a concusion. Good old country boy. I am not country. Doc, this is my scientific side. thought i just used to zone out in biology class, learned that wasnt the case not sure when he showed up.""""The Four Horsemen"" This is a complicated one, this one alter is spilt into 4 offset alters, who only can speak or write in four letter words. 
Which leads me to ""Dusk"" aslo a complicated one. He is my phantom, As the other alters put it he can come across looking like the grimm reaper but you feel safe when he is around. Now this is where is gets strange. SO on multple occasions I have gone to bed just to be woken up by my wife or kids cause they saw me or something that look like me staring out the windows in my apartment but the turn and see me either asleep on the couch or my wife rolls ove and i am laying there asleep. Not sure how to explain it but it has happen multiple time to many different people. and as soon as i wake up he vanishes. 
My question does anyone else have a alter like mine and has anyone experienced anything close to this sleepwalker experience.

Vulnerability,"I'm wondering if others have a hard time being vulnerable with their therapist. I am always so embarrassed to share somethings especially if it involves being vulnerable. I try hard not to like her too much or feel any attachment. I know it's a therapist/client relationship. I have been seeing her for 14 years. I've seen her cry with me about some really sad things I've shared. I've only really started opening up in the last year or less. She has always been caring and kind and real with me. I mean really letting her see my feelings and parts. I never would cry or anything. I've been trying to avoid DID. She says it's ok to have warm feelings for her and she does for me. I Know she means it and because we work together is ok and natural. I can't get past the boundaries I set because of her being my therapist. They are way more strict than hers. I can't stop thinking she's just doing her job. She wants all my parts to trust her and share their stories. She says she cares about all of them and wants to know them. I'm so hung up on it not being because she is my therapist and we would never be friends in the ""real"" world. I hope this has some sense to it.

Identity Crisis,"Outside of my alters I have several names that I go by, none of them chosen, mostly Nick names. It's honestly kind of odd to me when someone addresses me by my birth name. Im conditioned to respond to it, but my doc suggested that my alters are as well, so I suppose I've stopped looking at it as MY name. But I have to admit, if I'm not the dominant personality, I have a hard time accepting that name and I'm not sure how I would find mine...Im finding myself in a sea of names and none of them feel familiar. My drivers license, Social security card, even my homes property deed have the same name (as they should, obviously) but I dont know that its who I AM. The name of the whole, certainly, but Im clearly not whole. I had mentioned this to my Doc and he says its progress...but I don't feel that it is....and can't swear that it isn't. Im starting to feel like my therapy is making me worse than I was when I began. Has anyone ever felt like this? I've made my way through my fair share of existential crises before, but I can't seem to shake this one...am I over thinking? Underthinking? I don't have coconsciousness with any of my alters, there is an awareness for them of and through me (at least Sam and Cade), but Im in the dark (quite literally) when they're out...and recall nothing. This tells me I'm not the dominant personality...is that incorrect? I haven't been sleeping well for about the last 4 days, and the insomnia fugue isn't helping any...Im disociating...HARD. any thoughts or advice? ",multiple-personalities

And I'm lousy with doctors. Medical paperwork? Lost. Lab work? Forgotten. It is very frustrating and feels sabotaging, even in personal goals I want to reach, I have such a hard time staying on target or on a deadline.
Right now I'm uposet because I asked someone ... A person not in my system, an actual other human - to help me with some of this. You know, remind me of my doctors appointments, go with me, or help me stay on top of this kind of thing. 
I just saw that I minorly screwed something up again, and became desperately angry and upset.
Upset at me for being this way. Angry at the fact I feel the need for assistance and help when other people can do stupid shit like remember to go to an appointment.
But also upset at my person, who never remembers to check on me. I need THIS person to help me, for a lot of reasons, but they have proven to be unreliable. 
I am trying new systems but it feels like I am doing all the work to remind them to remind me to not forget!!! I am frustrated.

I've fallen down to the bottom of Maslow's pyramid and have to be essentially ""babysat"" by my husband or mom when driving or outside of the house (I've wandered off and gotten lost and have frozen and rapidly flipped in Wal-Mart).  My treatment team is great, but  I just do.  I just went from being an executive with an M.B.A. to someone that is terrified to leave the house and has to have a constant caretaker.  I just don't know what to do.   It's all very scary... :(",multiple-personalities

New to the postings..,"I just want to say that I have several personalities. 5 that I know of but my therapist knows I have more.. She's talked to several. Strange huh? She's the one who said I should join this group to help me out, so I can talk to people like myself. I have never acted my age. I have always been younger and I switch back and forth between female and male. I also look at my body and don't know why I look the way I am. I'm an alien as well. I have a woman by the name a Janie, who's extremely professional and like 25. I have a 16 year old who really cute and funny by the name of Gabby.. I'm also a 8-10 year old little girl who's scared all the time. I have my alien who changes all the time. Next and final that I'm aware of is a dude by the name of Jon who's a complete jerk who hates everyone and everything. He's in between the ages of 19-21. 
I'm aware of the personalities when I switch most of the time, but sometimes I have no idea. I have had sevetal severe mental breakdowns. The last one, I tried to commit suicide by taking 5 full bottles of my medications. Obviously it didn't work, which bums me out. This world isn't worth being in. I do have two children who I know need me, but I get selfish sometimes and just want to leave. I fantasize driving off the road when I drove sometimes, I also think about running people over with my car. 
I know my really sick in the head. I've been put in behavioral health two times already, the last one was in 2012. 
My therapist says I'm not inane, because people who are seriously mental don't believe they are. At least I'm aware though.

Some true hard facts were finally validated by my family. But they are horrible hard true facts. It's somewhat good to know that some of my family realize what hell I've been through. 
I am dissociating all the time. At the end of the day when my alarm goes off telling me to take my night meds its shocking to see how the whole day was gone. I dont' remember any of it except a few moments here and there. 
Yesterday morning I woke up and found that some of my littles had a bit of fun during the night.  There is marker all over my walls and crayons and paper everywhere. I didn't remember any of that.  I feel like I'm out of control trying to keep things together. 
At this point I dont know what else to do except dissociate. I can't handle real life right now. I try to sleep most of the day so I dont have to think about everything going on.

I am an adult with ADD,"Hello Everyone,
I am a 30year old student studying Animation in San Francisco. Very recently I found out that I have ADD. I started to take medication (Adderall 30mgs per day). I also started taking Psychotherapy. Its just a start but I am already seeing so many different sides of me which I was hiding down below this thick blanket of ""zero focus"". I understand that the path to solving this is very tough and I am not going to lie but I am very positive that I will take care of this issue in the near future! The problem is that I am by myself here. There is no one around me who can actively take care of me. Not that I need anyone but yes sometimes I do feel like I want someone who is physically present around me so that if anything goes wrong during this process than that person can take care of me. Definitely not looking for the same over here, it just feels good to let all these feeling out in open.Please let me know if anyone has any kind of suggestions or tips that I can use during the medication and Psychotherapy for ADD. Any kind of comments are welcomed!

Exam concentration question,"Hi, so I've never been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD but I've recently been told by a teacher (I'm in my final year of sixth form) that she thought I was highly likely to have it, and so I did a few of the online tests and scored very highly for all of them, way over the 'severe' threshold... it seems the reason I've never been told about this before might be at least in part because I'm somewhat 'high functioning' if indeed I do have ADHD and so people just assume I'm restless and bored... I know this is NOT a diagnosis in any way but as far as I know (although am very happy to be corrected!) a doctor will do pretty much the exact same assessment, and it makes a lot of sense for me as someone who has been extremely restless and really struggled with concentration since I can remember... I don't think I want to go to see a doctor at the moment because I have A level exams coming up soon and don't want to start messing around with my medications before that. However, in the meantime I'm really keen to find out how people manage to concentrate in situations such as exams without medication? Eg I have a three hour English paper and I really really struggle to stay put and stay sufficiently concentrated in order to achieve. Any and all advice would be really, really appreciated please!!

I am 16, in school currently working on my highers, and can barely concentrate on my work at home - either that or I'm so hyperfocused on something that my dinner gets cold. The fact I'm easily distracted is why I found my way here! I never get any work done and always end up hating myself for it. I've even tried turning of the WiFi and sitting my phone in the fridge downstairs! How do you keep your focus and concentrate through the day - or at least try to??? 
I read somewhere that BFRB's like trichotillomania are commonly associated with ADHD/ADD. I almost always bite my lip and/or tongue to the point that it bleeds really badly and swells up like a balloon. I have bitten my nails down to the point that sometimes they bleed and the longest one just now is about 6mm, well shorter than my actual finger. Sometimes I will even scratch a patch of skin so long that it will become raw and bleed - leaving me with big scabs that turn into scars. I don't do any of this to punish myself/ self harm deliberately, but it just sort of happens when I'm bored or doing something else, like watching TV especially. I always beat myself up about it and its always so sore afterwards. Any advice/help how to stop? Or know why this is or what it's associated with???

New,"Hello, I don't know if I have ADHD or not, but I am just looking for a little advice. I have had trouble focusing in school, ever since I can remember and I have heard others suggest I could potentially have ADHD. I've looked at all the symptoms and I can connect myself to experiences that suggest ADHD (constantly forgetting appointments, procrastinating on work, fidgeting, difficulty following through with assignments, distracted, etc.) Of course, I am not a professional. I have started seeing a counselor, who as also mentioned it could be ADHD. They also brought up the idea of medication. I am worried though because my brother has suffered from anxiety and has been on medication and now is off of it, so my mother doesn't believe its completely necessary and I should try other things first (counseling, meditation, practicing focusing skills, etc.)
Lately, I feel I have been getting worse. I am turning assignments in late and skipping class because of stress. I constantly beat myself to shreds because I feel I should be better. It feels like there is a barrier blocking me from all the things I need to get done, and when I look at the barrier, it's me. I am really trying to eliminate negative self-talk, but I cannot help but feel disappointed in myself. I don't want to fail and I don't want to keep putting myself behind.

Issues with doctor,"I've had to transfer to a new doctor in my college town, and they didn't like that my previous doctor left me with 6 months worth of my Concerta (12 hr version of Ritalin) prescription before she left last summer so that I would have plenty of time to find a new doctor in my college town, but for some reason my new doctor's office ( even though the doctor offered me a 6 month prescription a few months ago), is now acting like it is suspicious that I haven't gotten a prescription since last summer. That prescription was a 3 month prescription, but I still had a nearly full prescription from before it and I don't take it during summer or winter break, so I hadn't needed to get one filled until now, but they're acting like I must have been getting more from somewhere else ( presumably illegaly). 
Now, When I have too much Ritalin in my system it just makes me feel awful and lethargic, so there's no reason for me to either be taking more and getting the extra illegaly and it isn't expensive with my parent's insurance so there isn't any reason for me to get it through anyone but my doctor. Why would the office act like this, when it should be a good thing that I can operate in society without my medication as long as I don't need to be working?",adhd-add
Dealing with mild ADHD/ADD...,"Last year I was diagnosed with mild adult ADHD/ADD, and I told my family and they were basically like....""duh."" I guess the diagnosis makes sense to me, but I feel saying I have ADHD/ADD is a lie. I'm a mild case, so I technically display behaviors associated with the diagnosis, but I feel like it shouldn't be enough to really affect my life. However, it does and I guess I don't want to ""blame"" my diagnosis for my behaviors. It helps to know where the behaviors stem from to deal with them, but I feel like saying it's ADHD is a cop out. For those of you that have mild cases, if there are any on here, how do you deal with the fact that you're not completely messed up? Like if I were full blown ADHD and needed medication, I feel like I could deal with it better because it would be a more legitimate reason.",adhd-add
New regulations on ADD medicine?,"Hi, new to the website.
I've been diagnosed with ADD since elementary school, and medicated since middle school with Ritalin, with no side effects. This year my doctor told me that now I have to see a psychiatrist to examine how the drug effects me to screen for depression. I'm insured under Providence, does anyone know if this is just a Providence thing or a new national or Oregon State law?",adhd-add
Suffering from ADHD,"Hello everyone. I guess I found my way here because I have finally stopped self-denial and realized just how bad my ADHD is affecting my adult life. I feel like it has gotten worse the older I become. My mind is literally my worst enemy and to sum it up- it sucks! I act on impulse and make decisions I regret. I do things I know are bad and keep them secret from my loved ones because I literally act before I think about the consequences and reget the actions later. My mind always thinks about at least 3 things at once and I have the worst time concentrating when people are speaking to me. I am very hypersensitive and I think it will be the death of me one of these days.
I recently started going to the doctor again and because I have such high anxiety I was put on anxiety meds but not anything for ADHD because my doctor said it often causes depression. I haven't been on ADHD medication in about ten years. I was diagnosed at 17 after an overdose I had and ended up with a stay at the local mental health hospital. I remember stopping my meds then because I had to see a therapist to get them and I hated going to therapy. I wish I would have stayed, I could use a therapist now.
I decided it was time to get help again because I am terrible at 'adulting.' One minute I have all my ducks in a row and then the next day I throw it all to the wind without a care only to once again land in a puddle of remorse. I am so tired of feeling like a crap person because I can't even control my own behavior!! I sound so immature even as I type this but I guess it would be nice to know if anyone has dealth with these ADHD issues and how you overcame the struggle. Because I am seriously struggling right now and need help.",adhd-add
Newbie,"Hi allI stumbled upon this support group, & thought I would join to educate myself on this issue.I was diagnosed with ADHD only 4 days' ago. I started medication (1/2 tablet) the next day with insturctions to gradually increase. Today, I increased to 1 tablet, and have been experiencing chest pain hours' later. 
Has anyone else had this side-effect? I understand that this could be serious adversion, and it would be a shame to not be able to take a stimulant, because I've already noticed it's helping me with focus and moderating my 'motivation'. I am already very sensitive to medication - even coffee makes a strong affect on me.
I wondered if other meds may have different reactions in the body? And perhaps what natural approaches help? I'm still shocked by the diagnosis - but the more I understand it, it makes so much sense.
Thanks in advance for your advice, fellow supporters..Best wishes from Australia!",adhd-add
ADHD and/or laziness?,"i desperately need some feedback. 
I have a 20 yr old step son who is ADHD, his father is also ADD.
i need to understand what is laziness and what if ADHD. 
A typical week in our house.......asked to do the dinner dishes, half are still dirty and need rewashed. Dad bring home lunch for everyone (take out) bags and empty cups left at the table. Later that night orders two boxes or pizza. Next night one boxed finishes and left on the kitchen counter, next night second box left again, he has to walk right by the recycling bins to go upstairs. Asked next day to do the cat litter, 4 days later it’s still not done. Work is seasonal and lately there is none so he spends his nights playing video games and sleeps most of the day. Girlfriend arrives daily and they sleep in his room all day. Only comes out of his room when there is food on the table or may go to the gym once a day for an hour or two. His room is like a hoarders room, has garbage bags sitting there for months and constantly brings food and dishes up there which never resurface. Bags and containers of mouldy food, some actually are full of powder spores of mould. Garbage bags thrown in the closet. The puppy got in his room and pulled out a used condom from a dish we eat out of. But yet he goes through his room and has no dishes there. Rarely cleans it even somewhat properly.
Which brings up the constant lying. He was asked 3 weeks ago to clean his bathroom and claims he did it. He lies constantly about things he does or does not do to suit him. He’s lied to his father about me. 
He has anger issues!
His father excuses his behaviour because he understands being ADD himself. Says he thinks he already cleaned the bathroom “in his head” because he meant to do it. And the kid knows the boxes should go into recycling but his brain does not comprehend and can’t go through with the action. And apparently I don’t understand the struggles they go through. 
He is somewhat housebound from 9pm to 9am because he has bail conditions and trial is set for end of June which does not help. Due to his anger issues and wanting to be the “big” guy among his friends.
He is on meds, don’t know what, but I don’t see a difference in the past 2 years.
I’m at a loss, this is just the tip of the iceberg in my story. I’ve read lots and without being a nag all the time I remind them of their chores and mess he leaves to clean up. It’s fristrating cause I work full time and do so much in the house with 6 of us in and out of the house.
An Example of my reading about this and trying to help....after months of tripping over shoes at the front door he has finally got the hang of putting them on the shoe rack. Still forgets but has got better. I’ve read the constant reminders force good habits but there is only so much I can do and live with. It’s been over 4 years and I see the problem as getting worse and not better.
This has caused major conflict in my relationship with his father. I have 3 children myself. It has caused conflict between my kids and me cause this kid gets away with so much.
what part of any of this is ADHD? I believe there are bigger issues but I need to know the difference from other sufferers and parents of kids with ADHD.",adhd-add
New to Support Groups,"Hi.  As mentioned in the title, I've never done support groups.  I don't know if I need to talk about a specific thing or just introduce myself and see where the conversation goes.  But I realized this morning that I needed to change things up to get out of the rut I've found myself in.  So here goes . . . 

I was diagnoised with a rare neurological disorder called Apraxia of the Speech when I was 4 or 5 years old.  From what I understand, there was a percentage to rank the severity of Apraxia at the time and I was listed as upper 90s.  It was explained to me that the speech therapist told my mom that he had never seen results close to the same degree.  So . . . joy.  

I was in speech therapy until Middle School.  I would probably needed it much longer had I anyone other than my mom in my corner.  Every night I spent at least 30 minutes on tongue twisters and other verbal exercises.  Then I would work on reading for another 30 minutes.  Every day in school I spent 45 minutes in speech therapy and during the school breaks I would do that with mom.  Mom and I would play scrabble with my sister every few nights.  Obviously I was paired with her and she would help me form words.  Second grade I finally read my first book all the way through.  It was the Disney Beasty and the Beast book.  My reading skills flushed under mom's care and I was reading 8th grade level in 4th grade.

Then Middle School . . . where I was diagnosed with Bipolar.  I was luckily again as my mother had worked in a mental hospital before she married dad.  She got me into see a doctor and regular therapy.  

Over the years, I have had ups and downs in handling all that.  Then, last year shortly before my 30th birthday, I finally spoke to my doctor about a concern mom and I both shared.  If I had ADD.  I took the test and I was then informed, yes.  I do have that.

After all that, I think what really pushed me was a side effect I recently have dealt with.  When I was a lower dosage of Adderall, I had done an intense amount of mental work on a project for a client.  The next few days, I had trouble finnding the right words and finishinng sentenses.  My doctor told me he's had similar reports from patients if they did something like an intense body building workout and that in order to avoid it, they had not taken adderall on the days they did the workout.  So I do that any time I plan to do the same level of work as I did for that client.  But about 4 days ago, I forgot and did so.  However, this time I am on a slightly higher dosage and now have trouble speaking at all.  Unable to finish sentense, unable to remember the right word to say, and now a stutter.  It's gotten a lot better each day and if I close my eyes I only have to worry about rambling.  But it was the reason I started looking over side effects for adderall with Apraxia and came across support groups.

ADHD CHILD AND DIVORCE,"Good Morning Friends,
I am new here and searching for answers. A few weeks ago exactly 1week before my 5yr wedding anniversary my husband left. He cleaned out our family home of everything he wanted, and left a trash mess and what he didnt want. He did all this while I was at work and my 5yr old child was at school. No warning, no notice, no signs.
He blames it on my toddler (he is not Bio, Bio is not around) , his ADHD and how he feels that my son will eventually be in ""jail or a murder"" because he does not listen or control himself.
My child as I said is a 5yr old child dealing with not only medically Diagnosed ADHD but PTSD and a wide range of emotional issue do to his absent Bio father.  What kind of man walks out on a emotionally struggling child?
We are both heartbroken and now my son is acting out more and I do not know what to do for him. I hurt for the marrage loss but i hurt more for my son who cant understand why his only ""Daddy Figure"" told him beofore school that he didnt love him and was leaving.",adhd-add
School Advice,"My son was Diagnosed with ADHD through a state Theripist. Before he started back at a new school I made them aware and he was evaluted for a 504/IEP and was denied. He scored above average on all testing done but they did not concider his emotional state or hyperness.
Now a few months in and this poor child spend more time with the principal then he does in class, he missed his friends birthday celebration, he was asked to stay back for the kids field trip. All while getting 100% in school work. It is so hard to explain to a elementary school child why he was not allowed to go pumpkin picking with his friends.
The teacher set up a behavior log which means she send me a list of all his ""BAD"" behaviour. This is crazy i get a daily log of ""got out of seat"" ""was tapping pencil"" my favorite and cause for him to be sent home.... ""he popped a friends bubble""

I dont know what to do for my child, i would give him the world but the world is currently against him.

My son is off school this week and we been taking alot of 1on1 walks and talks and last night he told me he gets embarrassed when the Principal carrys him out of class in front of his friends...??? What??  Yes what i didnt know is when they want him to leave and he is now calm and collected more than once they have physically picked him up and removed him.
Im not sure what i can do or how to help him.",adhd-add
Curbing symptoms whilst using methylphenidate,"Hi there, I am a long time sufferer of migraines, I used to get them very often. For some reason they seem to have slowed down in the last year or so. I am now on Neucon for my ADD, it's pretty affective but I am having some symptoms that I was wondering if I can curb in any way. I am experiencing sweating (moderate during the day - severe at night), dibilitating headaches and depressive episodes where I am not rational and somewhat aggressive. I do realise these symptoms come with taking ADD medication, however, I was wondering if anyone had ways to ease this. I don't want to go off of it, I have always had a very active job where I was never at a desk but recently started an 8-5 desk job and I can't get anything done without it.

Question,"I don't know if this has to do with my ADHD/ADD, or something else, but for the past 8 years, I've been having these random twitches. Also, I have been taking Adderall since I was in 1st or 2nd grade. I am a junior in high school now. I have felt like the Adderall hasn't been working for me since freshman year, and I've told my doctor that. But all they want to do is keep upping the dosage, according to my doctor, I am now taking the highest dosage, and they want me to take a booster during lunch. They blame my Adderall for my lack of appetite and my inability to sleep. I believe that I may actually have insomnia. But they don't seem to listen.",adhd-add
Highschool and ADD,"I really wish my teachers were more understanding of my condition! I work very hard on my schoolwork, but never achieve what my friends without ADD can. Often times I would have studied more than anyone else in my classes, but still recieve unsatisfactory grades. Looking at my test grades, my teachers lecture me and tell me how I need to work harder, eventhough that would be impossible. As a 16 year old with ADD taking 3 AP classes, I often fall behind in subjects that I am uninterested in. Since AP biology doesn't interest me, I fell behind in that class. I would sit at home and re-read my asssignments, but nothing clicked. Even worse, my teacher would call me out for my unsatifactory grades, and enforce to the class how I need to improve my efforts. These moments make me want to cry, but nobody would understand. But the main isssue in our schools is not the lack of understanding, but the lack of respect and sympathy for those who are different.",adhd-add
Need advice regarding my son..,"About 4 yrs ago my son was in brick and mortar school. Well, his teachers started to treat him poorly and also bullying involved. This was before he was diagnosed with Inattentive adhd. The school refused to work with us. After conferences and multiple meetings we decided to keep him home and attend virtual school. Soon after he was diagnosed with adhd. We decided not to medicate him and we feel strongly about this. Meds aren't an option and there are health reasons why we chose not to as well. He has been attending a virtual school from home.  His grades are A's and B's and I'm his learning coach. I assist him when needed. I am here to redirect him when he is distracted.   This has worked out for us for the past few years. 

Lately when we see family members they ask him or us the dreaded question, so when are you going back to school? Are you putting him back into school?  Well, he is in school the only difference is that he is at home. This makes me so frustrated and annoyed because these family members do not know the struggles we face. I don't know whether to clarify this with them and let them know once and for all our reason for keeping him home . Is this something I shouldn't even have to explain to them?  Also, I question if there is anything else that I should do regarding adhd .The issues we have are that he is forgetful. He tends to daydream often and I have to redirect him during school.  I worry about him having a future. What is it going to be like for him if he is so forgetful. I want him to be independent. Will he lead a normal life?

But I have decided I need to find myself more support, in any shape or form, and I am prepared to reciprocate. Because I cannot rely on my family for support. 
So the question is A) Are there any Borderline specific Support groups in SA? , and B) Could 'dailystrenght' potentially fill that gap as close as possible to group therapy? 
Many thanks guys!",personality-disorders
A Little Antisocial?,"Is that possible? Can someone be slightly sociopathic? Because that's what Antisocial Personality Disorder is. I realize that there is very likely a spectrum, but it just seems like a very all-or-nothing disorder. You either are a sociopath, or you aren't. And if you are, what does that mean? That you're screwed for life??? Any thoughts, people?",personality-disorders
Anyone out there?..,"Hello, 
I just joined this group, I have BPD and have been working hard in my DBT therapy work books and audio books. However, I am missing the comradery and peer support. I’d love to shoot around tips and ideas with anyone that is interested. We are all in this together, and I’m grateful to know I’m not alone. I get discouraged a lot knowing that I have this ‘condition’ and I wonder if I’ll ever live a normal life. I am 27 and still not married and starting to panic. But because of my borderline I have trouble maintaining healthy relationships. I just can’t seem to manage my emotions properly. I really need help in this area. Can anyone relate?

Married to ASPD,"Ok so he hasn't been diagnosed yet, but wow! He fits it and it's getting worse. I don't know what to do about it. I deal with my own anxiety and depression and lately it's been so bad I can't function normally. I divorced an alcoholic 4years ago and I probably shouldn't have remarried but he was so good... in the beginning. Now, he's a sponge! A lazy, narcissistic, manipulative, never to blame leech. He's bleeding me dry. Both emotionally and financially. It's definitely not healthy for me to be in this relationship, but God help me I'm a loyal codependent. I see no help for me now or in the long run unless I end it. Why is this happening? I came from a childhood of abuse and emotional neglect, if that is a thing. But I have always been independent and resourceful. Until now. I tried to get him to set up a dr appt, he has so many reasons he can't. I tried to get his family around to show support with an ""intervention"" but got a big NO from his own mom due to her religion! I try talking to him just to hear ""we should divorce, then"".

staying friends with friend with BPD,"Hi all, so a little background on me. I was diagnosed with bipolar then it was changed to traits of borderline. so this was hard for me. I accepted my first diagnosis. but anyways thats not what this post is about. Its about my friend Lydnsey. She i fully diagnosed with Borderline. She is out going, pushes me out of my bubble, she understands my mental health and has been there throughout the whole getting help process. she is also out of control, abuses drugs and alcohol, she's pushed away all her friends and family. For a while, quite a few years, i was her family. I borrowed her money when she needed it, she always paid me back. I involved her in my family gatherings on christmas. I took her to visit to see her daughters, when her on/off again boyfriend would freak out and would start trashing the place, i would come over, kick him out, call the cops, get stuff through at me, clean up the mess, this happened 5-6 times. 
So in april of this year, we decided to move in together, for the second time. We figured having a 'stable' person(me) would help her get her daughter back. But i wasn't stable, my anxiety was climbing, i was reckless. She would beg me to go drinking with her on days beforfe i work, and i would. I would go gambling with her. I spent my money reckless, to make our apartment perfect. I borrowed herr 350$. Then in the middle of april, i reached out for help, my suicidal thoughts were getting out of hand. I went to my local crisis unit and it didn't help. I went to my local Emergency room and talked to their mental health nurse, each told me to come back the next day or go back to the crisis unit. Finally, on a wednesday, i went to the ER for the fourth day in a row,and they told me to make a follow up with my mental health worker and they sent me home. I felt so unheard..so when lyndsey was out at the bar, i downed approximately 60 tabs of 0.5 clonazapams. Lyndsey came home, i told her what i did. She took my remaining pill(later found out she sold them) and went back to the bar. I guess in my messed up state i called my aunt, who took me to the ER and after my 72 hours hold, i was sent to a psyc ward. While I was there, Lyndsey started to smoke in our apartment and got us evicted, and refuses to pay me back. My family moved me out while i was in the psyc ward, into my aunts house. Which is where i live now.
Lyndsey then moved in with a bunch of people who do meth,lost tons of weight. She then went to couch surfing, stole a car, stopped going to her daughters visits. She believes she can deal with her BPD without meds, or therapy. And has used it as an excuses to get out of 2 DUIs.
So i was hurt when i tried to kill myself she turned around and didn't help me, especially after the countless times i had taken her to ER for stitches from her cutting herself.. So i've kept my distant as i work towards recovery, with little contact. But today she contact me, it's her birthday on friday and we have always spent it together, so i made plans with her to have lunch. 
Now here's my question, with having BPD traits myself should i be sympathic and let her back in my life, or stay clear because i'm trying to make progress. ",personality-disorders

New Here: BPD Subtypes... I feel like an outsider.,"Hello everyone,This is my first forum post. I was newly diagnosed with BPD after a mental health crisis this past November. That’s a long story, and I’d be willing to tell it for anyone who has interest.What I’m really hoping you all could give me is some support with regard to feeling like an alien even within this diagnosis. Everything “fits,” but I hear so much about BPD being debilitating in terms of people not being able to work or not presenting well. I know in my heart that BPD explains so much of my inner turmoil and the things that send me into a “spiral,” but I feel very alone and confused. Every time I talk about BPD with my therapist or my boyfriend, I feel awkward even saying it -- like me harping on it is going to look like I want this diagnosis or am having fun with it or playing it up or something.By all accounts, I am a successful young adult. And I think it’s probably a massive stereotype with people with BPD can’t have success or normalcy. Nevertheless, I feel like my “high functioning” label is just a way to undermine the legitimacy of my feelings and identity.I’ve been reading about borderline subtypes and identify with aspects of them, but I guess the “discouraged borderline” is the best fit? But I know that these aren’t in DSM-5 and again that makes me question legitimacy of whether I'm just looking for a way to justify and rationalize my own inability to cope.Some may say that it doesn’t matter, and I know it really shouldn’t, but I have a compulsive need to riddle things out. I’m highly logical and sometimes I wish I wasn’t, because it makes it hard to accept that sometimes there are no best answers. I just feel so illegitimate.Does anyone else know anything about subtypes or levels of functioning?

To be understood; true love BPD&DID,"My lover says my 'BPD Is acting up'. Usually I stop, take a look and oh shit. Within one week I lost my relationship with my mother,  lost my job Of two years, cut myself (after months of abstinence), and I'm romanticising drug use (I'm in recovery). 
Now I would get offended if someone else told me my BPD is acting up.. But my lover(s) is/are DID (multiple personality). I am currently taking rage and outrageous acts of sex onto my lovers. But I think since our personality disorders are so closely linked.. they see beyond my rage, or sex,  or cutting, or impulsivity.. they see my truth. 
I've learned as a person with borderline personality disorder, that structure is key. I've lost my job of two years and my relation ships, but my lover's are always there. In the past I've had countless failed relationships or small flings or sexcapades.. But I have never had so much stability in a relationship as I do with the men that I love in this one body. I never would have thought, but being with someone who has dissociative identity disorder, has really taught me a lot about myself. I have love in my life, and understanding for once.
I don't know the point in this writing, but my lover has an alter that has homicidal thoughts and to him, murdering your lover is the most passionate act of love. I don't believe he would act on it, but since I know my BPD,  I understand him/them. I believe understanding can take a person of that edge of that cliff.
So my point in this.. I would feel so hopeless, I would relapse, slit my wrist deeper, maybe attempt again to take my life, spend all of my money, get into fights  and retaliate.. and god knows what else.. i would do all of these things if I didn't have a friend and lover who understood.
Having someone understand you is key to being borderline erotic/psychotic. If you feel hopeless, reaching out to your friend or lover, therapist, doctor, mentor, or on a support group like this can change everything, if someone understands.

For me these are exciting days, especially seeing that sites like this are available to those in need. It is wonderful to know there are people out there willing to help and who understand. I have been involved in mental health for a number of years, as a patient, a group member, a support person, and now a student.
I attend college and am presently working on my degree in Social and Health Services. My goal is to go into counseling eventually. Given the impact, my life experiences have had on me and others, I was able to make the dean's list for which psychology was one of the classes that got me there. I love working with people and love learning about myself. I grew us abused physically, emotionally, mentally and sexually. It has been a tough journey for me, but today I am supporting others and sharing hope and healing as I go. Glad to be here!

Looking for advice from older Borderline,"
I'm 40 yrs old and I'm on disability because of this illness. I am currently a non-functioning BPD type.I need help with a question. Is there anybody on here who has this illness and is over 45 yrs old and who gained a lot of weight in their late thirties until around 41yrs like I've done.I've seen it happen to others who have the same illness as me in AA but who are one or two years younger than me.I've also seen it in those who have the same type of BPD as me in AA but who are older.There is one guy who is I think 2 yrs older thann me and is huge compared to what he was.I'm hoping he doesnt go to the gym and his sedentary lifestyle is a contributing factor.However nobody (none of these people) is talking about it and nobody seems to want to help.Those who were where I am now (with my weight and at this point of the illness) when they went through it and subsequently lost it all again (at a particular age) dont tell the younger sufferers when? at what age they lost it because they are scum.They are inconsiderate of their own kind or their own species for want of a better description. Can you please tell me when you think the weight comes off.It was not gained through binge eating or drinking or exercise avoidance but due to mental health symptoms. Can anybody who had the same thing happen please let me know when the weight was permitted to come off again by the illness.The reason why I'm looking for a sufferer who is older than 45 is cause I dont think the weight comes off until then.that said I'm heading to an aa meeting tomorrow night hoping to see a chap who is a year older than me and who has been pumping iron in the gym and working up a sweat.I have no interest in the meeting i only want to know how the exercise has affected him asthetically.",personality-disorders
My Boss is my FP,"I have not been diagnosed with BPD, but heavily identify with many of the symptoms. When I brought it up to my therapist, she said that she couldn't make a PD diagnosis until knowing me for at least a year. I am not self diagnosing, I know it is very possible I don't have BPD. All I know is I relate strongly to becoming very attached to certain people and having a ""favorite person,"" so I felt that people here would be able to give me the best insight.
My most recent FP recently told me she didn't want to talk anymore, because she couldn't deal with my constant need for reassurance. That was literally a week ago. I recently started a new job and all of a sudden I feel SUPER attached to my boss. I haven't even known her for that long. I just want to constantly spend time with her and I feel like spilling all of my personal problems to her. I want her to comfort me. I feel like such a freak, I don't understand why I'm like this. It's not a romantic attraction. It's almost like I see her as a mother figure. Which is crazy because I have a mom and she's great and she's always been great. That's also what makes me skeptical to say I have BPD. I had a dream childhood, amazing parents who stayed together. So I don't understand why I get attached to people like this.
I guess I'm just asking if anyone else can relate? I know I can't get attached to my boss and I'm not going to discuss my personal issues with her, despite my wanting to. But is there any way I could feel less attached? I've been dealing with having an FP for years and it absolutely agonizing because it never works out. I don't want to deal with this my whole life but I feel like there's no way to help myself. I'm always going to deal with feeling attached to people who can't ultimately satisfy my wants.",personality-disorders

Identity Issues - BPD tw,"I know not everyone with BPD will have the same symptoms, but I'm curious how people that do have the no sense of self symptom build up their identity. It's something over the last few months I've been struggling with. The only parts of my identity that I have are my mental health diagnosis. (no idea what the plural is) Things I know I am as told by a psychiatrist, so I'm anxious & depressed etc. I'd go by my interests but they are forever changing probably because I don't know who I am. 
I have an appointment coming up with my Dialectical Behaviour therapist and I plan on asking him about it hoping he can give me some insight, but at the same time I don't know if he can as DBT is mostly about mood and self destructive behaviours etc. 
I do consider one thing a big part of my identity which is self harm, I've been doing it too many years and I don't want to stop because I feel like it's a big part of me. DBT has helped me a lot in reducing self harm but I'm still very reluctant to let it go fully. I know I should find better ways to cope which I do have but I feel it's okay to keep doing it every now and then, plus then I can keep my title too. That's also something I'm going to bring up with my therapist. 
Over the last few months I've even started to I guess question my gender, and then try to justify to myself that I am a girl. When I was researching up about BPD & identity, I found this post of a person who had transitioned from male to female but then realised that it was just BPD and that transitioning had given them an identity but it wasn't who they were. 
How do you know who you are? How do you cope with struggling to find an identity? 
Sorry for the ramble, I just have no idea who I am or how to piece it together. ",personality-disorders

Hello everyone!,"I am new to this site, and am hoping to find friends, particularly those who deal with personality disorders like me. I am open to reciving feedback from those as a form of self improvement. Today, I ask you all this question:
Why might a psychiatrist keep a personality disorder diagnosis away from you?
Last month, I had my first appointment with my psychiatrist. She was quick to diagnose my depression, and then brought up the possibility of having a personality disorder. When I asked her what it may be, she said she can't make a diagnosis right away. She told me that she has to see how the antidepressant works on me. I didn't think I would have to wait to review the medication in order to diagnose my disorder. 
I have a history of self-inflicting pain, hiding my true emotions from loved ones. I do this very well, to the point of when I really do express emotions, it seems out of the ordinary, or sometimes overwhelming. Rarely do I inflict pain on others, not intentionally at least. I used to throw things at the wall out of anger, but I always picked up after myself lol. I can also be a people pleaser, especially to those who are emotionally unavailable. With that being said, I come from a very dysfunctional household. My mother is self-centered, and I had to do a lot of parentification in my childhood.
Alot could be said about my childhood, but I would rather have someone ask me questions!
I know that even though through my personal info, I cannot receive a professional diagnosis, but tell me what you think regardless!

"been rethinking this, need info","too long of a story to retell, it's all here anyway.
been doing some rethink on this. i based a lot on what my 'wife"" (alter?) said one night. i had asked her to let me have my wife back, and made some reference to who was oroginal and who was alter. she looked at me: ""how do you know that i'm not the original?""  she said it with a lot of conviction but also in a very snide way.
since i don't know psychology much at all, much less shit like this, well, my tortured mind accepted the possibility that she was the original, this mean, cruel, very angry woman, the total opposite of my wonderful, loving, beautiful soul...wife.
she said this to me way back in march...around the time i last was with my wife and since then i have come to believe she was the original and my wife was the alter. now i am not so sure. my thought process is off-whack when it comes to this anyway. from different sources of info, probably not sure ones, i have changed my mind on this.  doesn't the tortured mind of a person who suffers a disorder like this, who has suffered so much anquish, horrible experiences and the like, doesn't it ""create"" a protector? an alter who replaces the original when the original feels fear, threatened, and not in control? from what i have figured, based on possibly unreliable sources, isn't that what often opens? an alter, set up to protect the original, often who is opposite personality traits, etc, who is strong, can stand up for themselves and ""protect"" themselves created as an alter?
i am just having problems believing that the mean, vindictive and angry one is the original, because she is so much different from my wife who was so much of an empath, she could feel other people's pain, who was a nurse, nearly always in an alzheimer care facility, who was very loving, caring and with such a beauitful soul...was the original and not the totally mean, angry, vindictive and hateful one? hell this one even hated my ""wife"", often referring to her as a ""slave"" and being weak...which she sure as hell wasn't.  i once tried to defend my wife when, who i now consider the actual alter...telling her my wife was no slave and was possibly the strongest woman i'd ever met. i was forced to shut up and was shut down before i could get any further...as if having me say anything in her defence would put a chink in the angry one's facade.
well i guess i am asking...don't those who suffer things like this, don't their minds create a protector, who takes over when they feel threatened, or apruptly live in fear and feel they don't have control? 
i just can't believe that the angry, hateful and vindictive one was the original and my wife was the alter. everything inside of me, based on my experiences with her, and seeing how she lived her life screams at me, ""she is the original!""",schizophrenia

Delusions because of schizophrenia,"I think it's interesting that many schizophrenics have similar beliefs or delusions and I wonder what mine are compared to others. 

Like believing in government conspiracies or that Jesus had a child or someone controls the weather. Hearing voices that speak in a different language like spanish. 

Just curious what are your delusions? ",schizophrenia

Questions about coping and learning more ...,"Hello,
I have a father with mental illness ( paranoia schizophrenia, biopolar, depression) and I was very young when he was diagnosed . I was too young to understand, was told that my father was getting help for his sadness. Painful and stressful years down the road I had to see/learn about a bit of his mental illness. But I feel like my questions are still not answer. I don't know who to go to or talk to about schizophrenia. This group site seems informative.

So my questions are: 
1) How to talk to someone with the illness? What to say or not to say?
2) Does the shot work? For How long?
3) Need more a personal explanation on living a life with paranoia schizophrenia. Like how did these voices came about . Are they yours or someone else?
4) Can I ask someone like my father to explain to me about his struggles? 
5) Will there ever be off switch cure ? 

Let's just say I'm a clueless daughter ! 
Thank u

Schizophrenic 23 year old,"Hello, my name is Sarah. I spent 3 months in the mental hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It was a terrible time in my life. I thought people were dying around me including my ex who I thought died and had his ashes in a bag. I also thought i was a famous singer & every day would pick out a house and car i wanted. I saw devil signs all over the walls, and literally thought i was pooping out babies.  So it wasn't the best time in my life by any means. I am now on Risperdal, and I'm not having any hallucinations thank God. Schizophrenics can live normal lives just like anyone else! If you have schizophrenia please don't be ashamed. It's just like being born with diabetes or something, you can't help it, it's what you were born with. I shared my story with my friends and they were very supportive. ",schizophrenia

He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and PTSD. Even when he’s home it is a struggle to get him through each day. He sees a psychiatrist and a counselor and is on several medications. I live in fear because of his suicidal issues. On top of that it’s hard because we have 2 children and I am the only one able to work. I am torn between being home to take care of him and working to provide for us and providing insurance for his treatment. Some days I am so afraid to open the doors in our home because I’m afraod I will find him dead. I don’t know how anyone handles it or can support their family.

Medication that doesn't cause weight gain?,"I take Latuda, no weight gain, but I'm still having psychotic episodes. I took Seroquel (I think can't really remember what medication) when I was misdiagnosed as bipolar and it helped a lot with hallucinations and paranoia but I stopped taking it because it made me gain weight. I have an eating disorder and weight gain is one of my biggest fears that's why I'm scared to seek help because I have seen shows where they force you to gain weight. Is there any other medication that won't cause weight gain. I also took Abilify, which didn't cause weight gain, but it worsened my bingeing/purging and plus it didn't work.

Difficulty with Motivation/Lack of Will,"I struggle with motivation and often feel like I'm lazy. And Luna and Norma, I know you struggle with this, too.
It's one of the symptoms of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related stuff. It can also be increased by some anti-psychotics.
I just want to say: we're not lazy. It's one of the symptoms we deal with.
I'm just now embarking on treatment for schizotypal personality and post traumatic stress disorder. I was worried, because in all my searches for information related to schizophrenia-spectrum and treatment, there didn't seem to be much focus on the lack of will/motivation. I felt discouraged, because it's one of the biggest barriers I face to having a fuller life, and I know it's true for a lot of us sz folk.
(I should probably mention that I'm a psychology geek... I love to read about it, and I love to post findings. Please let me know if I'm getting too spammy.)
Anyway, ""too long didn't read"" version: after much searching---there IS treatment for the low motivation/lack of will!

Help me understand," I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder six years ago. I have been hospitalized 17 times in the last nine years. I’ve been given the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder.  My current psychiatrist gave me the  diagnosis of schizoaffective bipolar type. Most of the time  i’m pretty functional. But when I get an  episode I usually have to be hospitalized.  I have been reading books on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and getting some understanding of my mental illness. At first I thought I just had bipolar disorder but it did not explain everything that I go through. I usually experience  mania and depression together with my psychosis and anxiety that causes me to have to be hospitalized. There have been times Where I have lost my ability to speak. I have completely checked out and been a dream like state not knowing what’s going on around me. I lost this much is two weeks at a time before. I’ve had hallucinations lasted five months.  All the books I have read don’t explain the disassociation that I encounter sometimes I do things that I don’t know I’m doing. I find myself tied up in the hospital not knowing how I got there.  My dad said that one time he heard three distinct voices when I was sick.  From what I have read this sounds like dissociative disorder or multiple personality disorder. I  want answers from the psychiatrist but they just want to give me medicine and send me on way my way.  Over the last six months I have been doing pretty good. I haven’t been experiencing any mania just a little bit of depression every now and then. My psychosis is pretty much under control but sometimes I get so anxious  that I start seeing spots and patterns and things look amplified. I know they’re not real and when I hear voices I know they’re not real  also.  I’ve lost my children because of my mental illness. I had postpartum depression and psychosis with my youngest daughter. I heard voices to kill her and  I was overwhelmed by taking care of my son and her. I never had problems with my son only postpartum mania but no problems bonding with him. With my daughter I just couldn’t connect and I didn’t really want her but I didn’t want to hurt her. It took me three years to get better but I lost the kids. Now my oldest daughter is almost 18 my son is almost 10 and my youngest daughter is almost 8 and I have custody of none of them my parental rights were terminated for all of them. This is very hard for me to deal with.",schizophrenia

I take alot of medication everyday and didn't realize that it was missing until I started to feel sick and have a manic episode then I checked to see if all my meds were there and realized that they weren't. I corrected the mistake for the rest of the week and called a friend told her what happened and asked her to go over my meds with me once a week and double check them to make sure I have them all so that I don't miss anything in the future. I also told my doctor when I went to see him today and he adjusted my meds for the next few days to offset the imbalance and told me to go back to my regular dose in a few days.",schizophrenia

Struggling to contain the anger,"I am 29 years old and have had an awful lot of anger inside me from as far back as I can remember. I don't want to milk my problems, but I've had a lot of issues in many aspects of my life and with many people in it. The causes for the anger can't be pinpointed to one incident, there are so many things that have contributed which makes fixing it so much harder. Lockdown hasn't helped. I am dwelling on things from the past that make me angry out of boredom. Also my current situation means I am more dependent on family than I would want to be. A lot of the anger has stemmed from family.

The last weeks I have been acting out on it. The thoughts come to a boil in my mind and I act out by punching something. Stupid I know, but it's a reflex almost, I have lost control come the time I throw the punch. And the punches and surfaces are getting harder. I don't know what to do.

The Blame Game,"I am seriously in a state of anxiety right now! I am so angry... I hate feeling sorry for myself and it rarely happens but today I am in a why me. This post may jump around because my emotions and anger have me all over the place in my head.
Why the hell did this woman who gave birth to me even bother? She never wanted me, never loved me and always reminded me what a mistake I was. 
I have been battling these feelings for more years than I care to admit. 
I actually hate her. I hate my mother. She is not a good person. She talked down to me my entire life. Let her numerous boyfriends and husbands have their way with me. Threw me out when I was in 8th grade because her perverted husband would always be there and I would grow up and move away. 
I keep seeing these posts about your mother is the one that will always love you, you only have one mother and blah, blah, blah. If I could slap her in the face I would. If I could tell her how she made my life a constant challenge and struggle I would. Would she care.... no. She has not answered a phone call from me in 10 years. How do you just turn your back on your child for any unknown reason. She discarded me as a child and then again as an adult.
Ugh... I hate feeling this way. I am everything she is not. I used her as an example of what kind of person I did not want to be, not as an excuse to be a poor excuse for a human much less a mother. Why can't I leave it at that?
Why do I allow myself to go through these times? Times where I cry, I feel rejected, I feel like my life was wasted trying to raise myself and pull myself out of depression, drugs, and abusive relationships all because she chose to raise a child she never wanted.
I hate the anger I feel inside and I am afraid that I will never be able to come to peace with it. How do I move past it? I thought I had forgiven her so I could have peace and here comes the anger. Sometimes I want to know that she is haunted by her actions, that somewhere deep inside she did love me, that she was proud of me at times. I would like to know if she ever regretted discarding me like stale bread. How do I move past the fact that I may never know and her treatment of me has molded the first 4 decades of my life in some pretty troubling ways. I want to know she hurts for what she did to me. 
I am so angry right now. I want answers to questions I will never get and it makes me angrier.

Act out before think it out,"Hi everyone.

I decided to do this to help me through my thoughts and to gather advice. My anger has been getting worse and i noticed again i am fighting with my boyfriend all the time. 
About a week ago, his buddy sent my bf a picture of a random girl on tinder who he said was going to come over for a party the weekend i was gone. I got upset over that.

The weekend came, and my bf took a snapchat of himself and this random girl who his buddy brought over and said he was trying to date soon, drinking. I got super pissed and told him to fuck off and we talked he apologized, it was ok. 
Then he took me out to dinner last night and drinking was involved...and next you know we are fighting, he said something that triggered me and i decided to get out of his moving truck and walk. I thought i ordered an uber, but somehow ended up in a car with an older man who was neither an uber or lyft. I know, Im an idiot. He took me back to my boyfriends house, and my boyfriend did not have his phone because it died and he left it charging at the house. He flipped out and was screaming and crying at me, which i do not blame him... at all. Sad thing is I do not even remember what he said to me that made me so upset. Next thing i know, he is telling me to go home, so myself being stubborn, i got into my car backed up into his truck. (luckily, there were no damages to either vehicles.) I pull back in, and park and tell him I cannot drive home. He goes inside and tells me to leave, so i am in my car crying and have to call my sister.  
I know i messed up. We both did. And we are ok now. we both apologized to my sister and his roommates but his one roommate wont even talk to us. 

Need advice and support.

Thanks.",anger-management
crap...now that won't do,"I finally got out yesterday. Had to go to Walmart to take care of some stuff, but I also had to sit around in the heat with my niece's BF doing work for him, which I didn't get paid for.
Walking around Walmart was a chore. It wasn't like I was depressed at the moment, nor even angry.
It was seeing all those ""happy"" couples, holding hands and acting all mooshy with each other. I woke up with anxiety, like I nearly always do...but once in Walmart, within at least twenty minutes, with the bright lights, the noise, yapping babies and all that crap...feeling closed in and unable to get out (like I usually did/do)...and seeing all those happy idiots...my social anxiety kicked in and like a flash, memories of being with my *wife* flooded in and anger came about.
I was angry seeing all those people, all lovey with their spouses, or whatever...laughing and loving each other, existing in a reality I once lived in...totally oblivious to other people.  The anger grew within me, seeing all this happy shit until I actually wanted to slap the shit out of these happy, oblivious people.  Angry at them for having what they did with each other. Angry that I exist without any love or happiness, or a *wife*...angry that I felt like an outcast.  Ignored.  Yeah, when I felt like bitch-slapping a few people just because of what they had and I didn't...I made a mad dash for the door out of the store.
It took a whole hour for the anger to simmer down.  
Thank god (or whoever)...I maintain myself as well as I do, even when this red anger seizes me. I am not worried that I will actually do anybody harm in reality...but just imagining myself doing something is bad enough.
I am going to see a doctor and a therapist next week.  I have NEVER had an anger management issue. I don't consider this an anger management issue. I am, under normal situations, a really nice guy...but this shit, it didn't come to me until last month...at least I recognize it as a mental issue now and want to get help...",anger-management
why does it seem there's ALWAYS one of these...,"I haven't been that much angry lately. Well right now, that's not a really good thing for me. I ""control"" my anger, I use it to fuel my energy to do the things I need to do.  It is a specific anger, the source, that is...not a generalized one.  I would say what the source is, but I don't need some self-righteous prick to come out of the woodwork and attack me, like one did in another group.
This is the thing: why are there particular idiots out there who read one or two entries and think they know everything about the author?
Yeah, suddenly they know all about you, based on those entries, as if that is the whole story.
It's not my fault, what I wrote in the other group's thing, to be misunderstood by this idiot.  I can't help it if they have a mental disorder and use that as an excuse to go off on a tangent and insult me.  Personal insults are not acceptable.
Isn't this place supposed to be a neutral place? Isn't this site supposed to be for those who are going through bad times, to come to and write about their experiences and seek some help?  Instead, I get blasted by some nuttard who can't seem to accept his own mental disorder and takes it out on me.
This is the second time for his rude comment, the first as a personal insult.
It's one thing to misunderstand something written, when the history is left out of that particular entry...but to be personally attacked is not what this site and the members (I'd hope) is all about.
Maybe this individual needs to be educated what this site is for.  I read a couple of his entries, oh yeah, such a poor fellow, having had his own experiences which were indeed traumatic---but then, he schleps over to my entry and personally insults me?  I wonder what all those folks who gave him their condolances and sorrow would think, if I copied what I wrote and his comments and put it into a comment on one of his entries?  Would that prove what a prick he is? Would this change some of their minds about this individual?  Maybe.  But I'm not that mean of a bastard, yeah I can be a bastard for sure, I've done my share of flaming people for shit they've said---but this asshole, no, he comes over to a couple of my entries and rattles off insults, especially the last one and does a personal insult.
He doesn't know shit about my recent history...like most people who haven't read anything I've written about it, you wouldn't know, so of course he doesn't know.  Personally I seriously doubt he gives a fuck anyway.  He has his own mental issues...so why would he care about mine?
Yeah I have recently learned, I complained a while back about my ""anger issues""---but I also very recently learned, it is these angry feelings which actually fuel the energy which drives me to accomplish certain things I need to do right now.
There is nothing wrong with being angry...it's how you control that anger.
Yes I am angry at what this idiot commented.  I can't reach through the internet and smack his face, break his nose for the personal insult, but I doubt I would, even if I could.  I pity the asshole.  I don't care if he has mental disorders, that's the thing. That's no excuse for him to make the personal insults.  
One thing I've never been good at---not getting angry at nobs like him, who know nothing about the situation and/or experiences of somebody and then go off on them with a flame job, turned personal insult.  Hell, it's so easy to be an asshole like that over the internet, all the victim can do, is like I did...rattle off my own insult in return, which I did...and bad me, I don't care how I write it, it's all rather spontaneous.  Do I care if I use bad words, or care little for this nobs feelings?  Hell no, I don't. Do I care if he is a victim of some mental and/or brain disorder? Hell no, that's no excuse.  He shouldn't be at this site. He is a two-faced prick.
Yeah, for the first time in weeks, I am angry. I was doing fine until this nob commented on my last entry.  I need the specific anger, the one I use to fuel my energy--I don't need some moron come out of the woodwork, like a vile human-roach, and personally insult me.
Here is a link to what I wrote in the schizophrenic group, it shows his comment, followed by mine...he shouldn't have made me angry, really, that's so uncool...and thus, in return, I admit, I was uncool.
Link --> I haven't been that much angry lately. 
Yeah I know, this entry probably shouldn't have been written here, or anywhere else for that matter...but, come'on, isn't this site meant for folks who need some kind of comfort to come to? Isn't this site supposed to be for us to come together and help each other? A ""safe place?""  It might be, as long as nobs like the guy who wrote me, keep their hurtful, personal insults to themselves.
I will apologize to other people for my angry retort, but apologize to the nob? When hell freezes over twice and then turns into heaven.",anger-management
Getting pretty lost...,"I use to deal with severe anger when I was younger and I just kinda mellowed out as I got older..... 
for the past few months I feel so agitated and that develops into an intense anger that I refuse to let explode out into my life and affect my family. I feel all my muscles tense and I just feel like the only release to make the intense anger building up inside me is by breaking something or punching a wall or something I don't know. I feel crazy, my brain stops rationalizing with myself and I can't stop my brain from just amplifying the anger even more so, everything goes foggy and I don't know myself anymore. And I have a hard time talking about this to people in my day to day life because I'm tired of being brushed off like I'm overreacting, because I do really well on keeping my I internal issue internal.... for the most part 
I don't know what exactly I'm in search of by joining this group, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm alone in this feeling. ",anger-management
today was better,"For first time in weeks, there was no anger inside my head...just a horrible migraine.  I have had chronic migraines for years, and when I am hit by a bad one, it can last for two or three days. I always try to just mush out when I get one.

"Anger in Sacramento, CA","I live in the capital of CA and the drivers here are the worst.  I get so angry and upset that there is no regard for safety.  I see people texting and taking selfies while they are behind the wheel.  And no cops around to stop them.  They drive too fast, cut you off, ride your butt and rude.  Then I work in a place full where management is so lax.  The assist mgr overrides the manager!!!!!!  They allow people to come in late, talk and get so loud and obnoxious, play with nerf guns and fabric snow balls and nothing is done.  They show no respect or courtsey towards others.   I get so angry, it takes me a while to calm down when I get home.",anger-management
this anger...i cannot get rid of,"too many etc issues to explain, i am in other groups and have written a bit about the major issues. i have been away from this site for too long, i have adult add, social anxiety and severe depression. moved back to homestate of texas which hasn't F'n changed since i was a teenager in the '70s.  no help for poor folks with medical unless on medicade with kids or social security, well i have been fight social security for years now i have to start all over again in a state which has NO medical for poor people who don't qaulify for their version of medical insurance. that is one issue.
i have had at least three days in the past two weeks where i have been SO f'n angry, made my blood pressure go high and i couldn't calm down for hours.
the main issue? what the F happened to my life, i'm 63 and my whole life is shot to hell.
why did she do this to me? my supposedly un-diagnosed schizophrenic wife. she isn't my wife, she is the original. my wife was her alter and her schizophrenia or whatever it is, for at least 14 years was dormant. then the shit hit the fan jan. 2019. i tell people my wife is passed since mid-march 2019, that was the last time she, well, ""existed."" the original, an angry hateful soulless individual, she didn't want anything around as a reminder or whatever else, about me and her alter. she has successfully alienated what family she has left, including her daughter.  the only three or four people she associates with are ones who have no clue about her. they ""see"" her and even though she is now, seemingly pernamently in her delusion seriously believes her, whatever, as real. yeah two people she knew years ago before me, her old BF who beat her and emotionally caused her issues and his totally stupid mother. the other two? her meth dealers.  yeah, it all came back, this psychological thing due to the environment of fear and her return, after 14 years to meth.
don't judge.
my anger comes from that...my anger comes from how i am living now...from where i am living now...from not being able to control my anxiety, adult add, chronic spine pain, chronic migraines, cluster headaches---i was on an Rx for Norco for years, when i lived in California, my doctor knew it was the only thing which helped me and my pain. i come back home to texas and NOTHING HAS CHANGED. it's still the caveman attitude, control over people, no humanitarian programs and NOTHING to help poor people worth shit. i love texas, it is my birthplace but i am ashamed of texas for its draconian laws. one has to go through SO MUCH medical bullshit with idiot foreign born doctors who INSIST on surgery for the situation...yeah, want to make me a f'n cripple? yeah, let's do surgery which guarantees a 90% chance i will live what i have left of life in a fucking wheelchair AND yeah, no disability from Social Security.
WTF is wrong with this damn state? 
that is just one issue for my intense anger.
the her who isn't my wife.
no ability to earn a living because of things out of my control.
where i live, so far out in the boonies, there are hardly any people and the ones who are here...well i am certainly an outcast.
it is easy to say ""i hate life"" when you are being beaten to shit.
but what if ALL you have is anger, what kind of life is that.
i have so much anger right now, and other issues, i am ready to check out of the hotel...that is what i call IT.

41 and angry,"So I am brand new here. Searching out help for anger issues I have had for quite a long time now, I had an outburst this afternoon. Got home after work and none of my electronics would work. The TV, PS4, and the PC. These are the things I tend to do when home. So them not working threw me into a fit. I threw the remote and my coffee table, luckily I didnt destroy it. After a little tinkering things started to work again. I am just so tired of flying off the handle over little trivial things like that. This of course has also happened with coworkers at work, and with family members in the past. When I'm not angry I'm a very fun and likeable human. So I'm out here searching for any and all support I can find. Please help me. I have found a possible anger management group setting that I might join. ",anger-management
Ways to Control Anger,"I feel like I get angry at things I shouldn't. I say that, because after the anger is released and my fiance and I get away from each other for awhile I think about it and think that what I got angry about was something stupid.",anger-management
Observation,"My boss comes in and says things he thinks is funny but in one case the information was incomplete and thus changed the jab into something offensive.  Just because I cannot remember his exact words or date of the incident he said I had a way of twisting words in a negative way and it needed to stop.  Short of recording it, which is not allowed in the state of Texas all I can do is write it down. But honestly what does that prove?  I feel at this point he will do the same and twist things to make me out as a troublemaker, which I am not.  He harps on me asking questions in a professional manner yet I tend to be a bit slow on purpose as I like to think about what I am saying before I say it so that I don’t get it wrong. If I don’t write it down to talk to him in private which is the correct course  of action then I forget to address the matter until it comes up again and I get angry. Saying something in the moment leads to things being said in a group setting which is deemed inappropriate. I feel like I am dammed if I do and dammed if I don’t. Is this really all my fault or do I just need to grow a thicker skin?",anger-management
overwhelmed.,"I do have trouble controlling my emotions when I get overwhelmed. I get in moods where everything just irritates me and I end up having and outburst at people over small things. I let everything build up inside before I end up yelling at someone for something dumb. I realize after I have calmed down that I came off in the wrong way. When I try to not snap at someone when I am angry it ends up coming of in other emotions, mostly tears. I guess I let things build up, because I feel like I can't talk to people about everything going on in my life. I know they are just as busy and going through their own stuff. I need to find ways to realese anger and irritaiton in other ways, so I don't become overwhelmed. ",anger-management

Anger and addiction problems,"Hello everyone. I am new to this group. I have been married for 15 years and had a wife that tried and failed to help me with all my problems for years. I have severe anger issues. We had a big blow up a month ago over my porn and gambling addiction. Instead of getting mad I finally changed. I turned over all our finances to her and haven't watched porn since then. However it may be to late for us.I have had the most open and honest relationship with her since then and learned that even though I knew my anger was bad I didn't realize this game I had done. I have been an emotionally abusive husband and also on a couple occasions physical toward her. The physical altercations I have very limited memory of. In those she said I grabbed her and shook her. I am trying really hard to change who I am and get a control on my anger now. I have realized that between porn and finances and the lies I used to tell to cover them up fed my anger. I'm happier now than I ever have been. I am working to find support groups, on-line groups and therapists. If anyone has information please send it my way

"Ok, members.......am I right about this???","I've been at this group off and on for about 4 years.  I've seen a lot posts go with no comments. 
I just wrote a reply to a new person but I really think this issue needs to be discussed.....don't you. WHY DO POSTS go here unanswered with no replies when there's over 2,000 people in this group????????So here's my theories, and I'm adding another, too. 
In the spirit of giving every person in this group the benefit of the doubt, I have wondered why some posts just go ignored. 
Here' are my 2 theories about PEOPLE in this group.
1. Most of the people in Anger Management work 28-40 hours a week, so they come home tired and spent after a hard day at work and most days they DON'T want to come to Anger Management group b/c they're tired. 
2.  Most of the people in Anger Management are parents.  Kids take a lot of time AND energy.  So when they're spending a majority or even 18-24 with their child/children, they DON'T feel like coming to Anger Management group. 
3.  Yes, there's over 2,000 people in this group but that's an EXTREMELY DECEPTIVE NUMBER!  Many people out of the 2,000 probably haven't even looked at this group for over 2 years and are completely inactive.  I mean I was inactive for months, but I dropped out so that I wasn't just another inactive member.  I've in another group here Christian Fellowship.  They respond better than this group, but the maximum number that come to the group regularly and either post or respond are less than 30, and again, that's another group with thousands of members!!! 
So, in general, the people that make up Anger Management, are good people with busy lives.............so SOMETIMES you don't get a response to your post.  ",anger-management
Angry about my mom,"I feel upset because my mom doesn't try to listen, understand or even aknowledge my struggles and ""shortcomings."" I go to school full time and do work study, so I have a really busy schedule, I'm also having up for a car. My mom wants me up at 4:45AM and out the door at 7AM. She doesn't aknowledge the fact that I sometimes emd HP having to do my school work early in the morning because I have trouble staying awake around 9PM, or that it takes me a minute or two before I'm ready to go. She never had my brothers leaving the house at 7AM. They would at least leave at 7:20AM and I tend to be ready around that time. I feel like she gives me a hard time because I'm the oldest and she's a helicopter mom in my opinion. She won't give me a break and she's always being difficult. If she's nice then I fear she'll go back to a negative state again and I distance myself to avoid being hurt emotionally. I never asked to be in this situation. It'd be great if I could work more while in school and have a car. I had no help from my parents to get a vehicle. My dad said he would help but he never did. He's a jerk. And it'd be great to live on my own but I'm in school full time and it's hard for me to balance working long hours while in school. I tend to take a little more time getting things done. Its always been my pace. At least with work study I can study on the job. My mom said she'd help my refresh my driving skills but now she's making me jump through BS hoops just like my ""dad"" did when he said he'd help me get a car but never did. Over 1 year ago I had to spend almost all the cash I had at the time on driving lessons. Over $400. I've barely had any help from family in this process of getting on the road by myself. I look at my friends and I see that they've had the support of their families getting on the road. I haven't had much of that. I just feel like no one understands what I'm dealing with, I feel like no one will, like they'll just claim I'm being entitled or lazy, but I'm doing the best I can here. I just wanted to express myself. Maybe I won't get angry and have an episode if I let it out here. Thanks for listening...",anger-management
Video call / chat support group idea,"Hey everyone, I'm a bit new here. I noticed that there are a good bit of people in our group but not a lot of people seem to be active. I was thinking we can video chat as well, and have it as an added way of connecting more and getting our feelings out to each other / expressing ourselves. I was in another support group a few years ago and we would get together to video chat on Skype once or twice a week, it was pretty cool. We can also start a live chat group on a platform. I know they have different platforms for video chatting and regular chat, I just wanted to know what you all think about this idea. It'd be great to get some feedback and to see if we can make this happen.

awful anger," I'm very angry over what happened. 
I had a job at a private company drivers' ed teacher and Behind-the-Wheel instructor
While I was doing the Behind the Wheel part,  I was with a student.  Earlier, he went to China and lived there for 3 months (during the summer).  So, he came back.  Very nice kid, when you complemented him, you could see a genuine smile.  He wasn't jaded or a smartass like a lot of teenagers.  His name, since he's Chinese, is Hong, but everyone calls him Tommy. 
The lesson with him started bad, because I was late. The school/company gave the wrong address to his house.  I was ANGRY ABOUT THAT! Then during lesson, I would tell Tommy to turn right or left.  I asked him to do this a number of times, AND HE WOULDN'T DO IT. Finally, I said, ""Tommy, I told you to turn left! What's going on???""

""I'm sorry, I just wasn't paying attention,"" Tommy replied. That actually reduced my anger, lol.... I smiled and said to Tommy, ""Well at least you're honest, Tommy!""  But the lesson continued to go bad. 95% of my lessons go good so I didn't WANT TO ACCEPT FAILURE IN THE LESSON. But by being so persistent and trying too hard with Tommy, I took an extra 1/2 hour.
But after Tommy's lesson I was enraged.  The lesson was awful. &Now, I felt I failed my next 2 students, because I was going to be over a half hour late for both students.  So I let one student know.  She was ok w/ me being late.  
Then it happened the thing that I want to cry about everyday!!I tried and tried, but couldn't reach the next student.  So, I settled for sending her voicemail.  I did this over bluetooth so I didn't break law.  As I just finished and ended the voicemail, some car from behind almost hit me at an intersection.  So i swore.     I was hoping I hung up, and she didn't hear it.  But deep down, I knew that voicemail caught me swearing......It did.  She played the voicemail to her parents.  They were understandably angry.  They didn't know why I swore during end of my voicemail.  Then the student put a ""NAIL in the coffin"" of my employment at the private driving school company.......she spread my recording of the voicemail all over social media!!  
So they fired me.  I was wrong.  Even though I was scared of this car veering into me to hit me...he didn't hit me.  I was wrong to swear. i was wrong to swear under any circumstances.  & when I did cuss, it cost me my job.  I cry about this some.  I brood and feel awful about it.  Nothing is consoling my anger and sadness about myself over this.  I pray and I don't know, I just don't know......the SHAME isn't going away! 
I have successfully worked for Uber and do so now to replace that job I was fired at.  Then I found out I can get a good deal for this rental car w/ Lyft, so I'll work for them.  But nothing is keeping me from being angry, and nothing is stopping all the shame I feel!!I just don't know what to do other than concentrate on Uber or Lyft. But it's not the amount of $$ I need to ""make ends MEET"".  I FEEL SO AWFUL OVER THIS!!!  
**  Later, I told the mom that he wasn't learning as well as he should.  Then, weeks later, I broke the news to him and his Mom that he did not pass Behind the Wheel. Everyone (the school, Tommy's Mom and even Tommy himself!!) said I was right for giving Tommy a failing grade.  ",anger-management
New to the group and really scared,Hi everyone  . . I am you to the group and I am really struggling. I seem to have one meltdown after another where I act viciously towards another person.  I don't know what's happening to me and although I've had episodes in the past they are just becoming so frequent now.  I'm scaring myself and cannot trust myself anymore. I dread the thought that one of these episodes at the place where I live will lead to me being pulled into the office.  My neighbor over a year ago told me she was worried about me because of my temper and I've gotten worse since then.  I've been diagnosed bipolar about 10 years ago but have never had a med check since then so I am going for one in the next week or so. I also have some possible therapy coming up if I'm lucky.  I have to test my higher power completely that I do not have dire consequences as a result of my behavior. So far I've always been verbal and I truly hope I don't become physical in the future as I get older. Because this condition seems to get worse as I age.  ,anger-management

It's really hot even at 7 am to work already so I don't want to do it then as she asked. If she would have ran it by me could have done it by 6 or 7 it's still warm then but eventually it gets cooler. I'm so tired of her trying to get her way. I'm tired of this oh I should help she's older making me look bad crap. I won't be walked over I help people when I want not because I have to.

Seeking help for my anger,"I am new to the group and just starting to post things.
I have always had an angry streak in me. I have recently tried to actually wonder and think about my anger and frustrations. It is worse lately because it has negatively affected my marriage. We have been married for 5 years this coming Monday. She has put up with it this whole time and has told me that I need to work on it. I used to always agree, say I was sorry, and would be good for a few days. Then something small, like something I thought should go a certain way wouldn't I would get mad. I have yelled, thrown things, say spiteful things, I have even thrown my wife to the ground. 
A month or so ago, we split into different rooms of the house. She sleeps in one room, I sleep in another. It has been killing me, I don't like it. It has led to this because I didn't seek help before. She has said it is too late for me to fix our relationship. I have never accepted this and don't ever want to. I love her with all my heart. 
I know before that relationship can even begin to get better, I need to work on myself and my anger, which I feel stems from selfishness. Any advice to gaining control of myself before my blood starts boiling?",anger-management
Free floating anger,"I just finished a session with my therapist and the discussion was mostly how to balance the the interplay of being right and maintaining an healthy/growing relationship with my SO. Mant times it feels the just free floating anger grabs an issue and I am ""off to the races"". Its hard to look at an issue as not being that important to be right at but its more important to nurture the relationship fully and without conditions. I am trying to TO myself until I am calmer and can understand whats more important...there are more important things than to be right or wrong in life and supporting/nurturing/being with others is the priority over petty issues. The discussion also was centered around defining whose problem it is/was, who is responsible for solutions if appropriate and finally what can be done to prevent an occurrance from rearing its ugly head in the future. Its alot to process but I have an afternoon to myself before sharing with SO and that would give some time for it to bubble through my conscious, to my unconscious, and back again before needing to make sense with it.",anger-management

About two month ago I started ripping my clothes. it's getting worse day after day. The urge is strong and impossible to resist.

at my wits end,"I am a mother of 3. I have a soon to be 14 year old, a 11 year old, and a 3 year old. I am losing my mind with the 14 year old. This child is disrespectiful, starts fights, hits, pinches, and says nasty things to my 11 year old. Takes over when i am trying to disapline the 3 year old. Has said that he wants me gone. I have lost my s@#t today. Not the first time by him taking over with the 3 year old. I threw a chair, so I would not hit him. He is also transgender which isnt the issue for me at all. Boy or girl this has to stop. He is manipulative. He will make stuff up to make me crazy. To push my buttons so that i will do something i will regret. I have no control in my house. My husband is tired of us both, but i feel he is most angry at me. I have gone to counseling. I put him in it to. He has only used what he learned from going to use against me. I know i sound like a crazy person. I have said today for the 2nd time. It is him or me. My child hates me. He says it is because that is what i have said to him. I have said i hate what happens between us. I hate that he pushes me into these agruments. I hate that i have no say in my life. He rules this family and I am tired of it.

Feeling Lost,"Hi, everyone...so, I am new here and I am just feeling really lost right now. I am a mother to four, amazing girls and I absolutely love being a mom. My oldest is 12, she is also my step-daughter, even though I have been her mother the majority of her life, and an event happened tonight that is just bothering me and shaking me to my core and I hope that someone is out there that can help me. My daughter has a stealing problem and has continuously stolen from me on various occasions and has been different things from my essential oils, to make up, to stealing money from my wallet. Of course, we have followed all the ""right moves"" and different tactics with her, but it continues. Tonight I found something of mine in her room again and I just lost it. People say they have an inner-demon living deep down inside and well, mine came out tonight. I try not to let my anger get the best of me, but I just couldn't stop it. Every curse word I knew came spewing out and it was just all bad. All bad. I broke my favorite coffee mug, the things on the kitchen counter were fair game to being thrown across the room. Even the dog ran away and hid under the bed. I try not to lose my cool, but lately it has been getting worse and worse. I feel triggered more often and over the smallest or stupidest things. I just don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Any tips? I tried going for a walk to cool off, but couldn't make it half-way down the street before I broke down in tears. I need help controlling this beast but I don't know where to start.

im here looking for help to deal with my anger . I don’t get physical but I do say things I do not mean and call my significant other mean names when I get upset and angry.

It's like night and day..,"Hey all, I’m new to the group.. 
I’ve been with my boyfriend for about six months now. Everything was truly amazing. We became close very quickly. Most people would say we rushed into things, but it felt so right. Everything came so natural to us. I always wanted to date someone who felt like my best friend. That was him..
Eventually, like every other relationship, certain things began to change. Those details are unimportant for this column, but our relationship hit a rough patch. One thing that I will say about our relationship is that when we disagree or argue, it doesn’t last long. In the last six months, there have never been a night that we were away from each other or created space because we were upset. We worked things out quickly, but that doesn’t take away the things he does when he’s mad..
I am not a professional in any way, but I believe 110% that he has anger issues. Sometimes he  loses control. It’s been gradually getting worse, and as much as I didn’t want to come to grips with reality, I knew deep down that the other night would happen..
Without making this a long, drawn out post, this is pretty much my boyfriend’s behavior in a nutshell...
Whenever we have a “fight”, he loses control. He has thrown/broken things. Punches the walls, stomps around aggressively, etc. I sit there calmly while he acts out. I will admit, there have been times where I have laughed or been sarcastic because I see no reason for him to behave that way towards me, especially when the things we have argued about have been, IMHO, minuscule. Within those six months, he never put his hands on me. But I knew in my heart that one day he would..
Last week, we were arguing (details not important, but it was something small). We argued, he broke things, and then I packed my stuff. He wouldn’t let me leave. He took the doorknob off, blocked me, kept taking my stuff out of my hands, etc. When I went to run downstairs, he grabbed me and tried to restrain me. When I yelled and fought back he went to grab me and I almost fell down the stairs. He ended up pushing me and I fell to the floor. The second he saw me hurt he broke down and freaked out, yelling at himself and apologizing, etc. He was visibly distraught. That night I told him it could never happen again.. But I didn’t believe it wouldn’t be the last time..
The other night, we argued because I got “distracted” while trying to tell him a story on our way home. I had anxiety and couldn’t focus so when he got irritated and told me to finish, I gave him an attitude. That is what started the fight.. 
I woke up yesterday with horrible bruising on the inside of my arms. My stomach is sore. My heart hurts..
The fight went the way it normally does. He started stomping around and yelling/breaking things. I go to pack my stuff. He rips things out my hands, telling me I’m not leaving. He hides the doorknob and my phone. As I’m arguing with him, telling him it’s over, he yells back that it’s not over because he said it’s not over. Tells me I’m not leaving. Says he’ll follow me. Every time I go to run out of the room he restrains me. This time he took it further.. He picked me up and body slammed me on the bed. After that I lost my mind, screaming, crying, fighting. I was completely triggered from past sexual abuse. So I began to hit myself and threaten to slit my wrists hoping he would get scared and maybe stop? Idk what I was thinking.. Anyways, he ran up to me and put his hands on my throat and choked me. Immediately after, he put his hands on his head and became upset, crying that he didn't know why he did that and he hates himself and blah blah. I stood in the corner hysterically crying and shaking.. 
He wouldn’t let me leave the house, claiming that he was too scared to let me go in this state of mind..
Eventually things calmed down and he told me that he wants to go to counseling for anger management. We talked about abusive behavior and he said for a very long time he never saw that behavior as abusive. He thought abuse was just physical, like hitting and punching. Once he sees my reaction, when he sees that he hurt me or when I break down crying, he breaks down. He says that he hates himself and doesn’t want things to end. I just want this behavior to end...
I feel so torn.. I’m not in denial. I understand that his behavior is abusive. I understand that he loses control. I don’t blame myself. This is not my fault. I’m not going to change the way I react to “prevent” him from losing control. I am working on my sarcasm because I know it isn’t pleasant, but that’s how I defend myself I guess?
He is serious about treatment. I know that he has gone through a LOT in his life, things that would make anyone angry. He is not in a good place financially, we have been through a lot lately and he has been really unsuccessful with looking for work. Still, that doesn’t and will never excuse his behavior. I know that everyone before me has given up on him or wouldn’t take the chance to understand WHY he gets to the point he does.. It’s all he really knows.. 
Listen, I love this man. He is extremely gentle and loving most of the time. He is very affectionate and kind. He will literally give me the shirt off of his back. He is loyal to a fault and takes care of me. He is very protective of me and has literally stepped in front of me and held me behind him in a dangerous situation. He has been my rock since the beginning and supports me in everything I do. He is a good person, amazing person and has the potential to be my dream husband/father. I don’t want to leave him. When he saw the marks on my body, it was clear he was full of regret. I told him this can never happen again.. We both need to work on things, not just him.

I really would love some advice from people who have been in my shoes. I know most abusive partners start where he is at now. Is there anyone out there whose partner actually got treatment and changed their life for the better? Am I in denial? Should I just wait for treatment and go from there? I know it takes two to tango and there are ways I react that I need to change. I love him. The second I came to that conclusion, his problems became my problems. We are in this together, and I want to do my part in helping him. Everyone else has walked out on him, rather than sticking it out and working through their problems. 
There are SO many things in his past, his childhood, that have influenced his current behavior. He has lived his life thinking that certain ways of reacting is “normal”. He really is an amazing person and despite the chaos of the last two weeks, I know that he loves me. 
I just want to fix things, and I know that will not be all sunshine and rainbows. It’s going to be a long road, but in this moment I truly believe 100% that he is worth it. 
Can anyone relate?

Anger towards society,"I get a general sense of anger when I go out in public and it has gotten bad over the past 2 years
I have been a firefighter for 9 years and I think the job may be taking its toll  
I have seen quite a few terrible things which I think have made me more cynical towards people. Mostly people doing horrible things to other and themselves and not really giving a rats a** about consequences
Its made me believe that he average person either does not care much about life or takes everything for granted
So for example, when I’m out and I hear someone complain about something as trivial as getting the wrong drink or fighting traffic I want to explode and scream “REALLY THATS ALL YOU THINK ABOUT?”
My wife says Im way angrier than I used to be and on a few occasions when Ive had a few drinks I really wanted to fight someone to get all of this anger out. Which is not me at all.
I’m not sure if I’m making any sense but thanks for listening.

Angry all the time,"I am so angry, all of the time it seems now. These people started moving into the neighborhood that I have lived in for all together about twenty years now, about two years ago. They decided that they don't want me and my family living here anymore and they are doing all kinds of stupid s#### to make it happen. They are interfering in things that don't concern them and spreading lies. I am trying with everything in me to change how I feel about them and this situation, but, it is not working. I am consumed with anger. The audacity and ignorance of some people astounds me. I pray and I pray, but, nothing is changing. These people are content in their ignorance and I believe the only thing that would help is a community exorcism. The devil has these people in the palm of his hand, they are the puppets and he manipulates the strings. I try to be the bigger person, but, it doesn't work. They do the dumbest things and I don't understand why they do them. Primitive, small minded little people. Why is it that some people can get away with so much and never have any repercussions, but other people, if they so much as even utter a curse word, the ceiling falls in on them. Why is that? Can someone explain that to me? My mother says nobody gets away with anything because God sees everything. I believe in God, always have, I am just really having a hard time with this. They say "" like"" speaks to"" like"", that's why we don't get along. The funny acting people who have known me longer are now friends with these people and they all seem to get along fine. Color me surprised. I can't meditate because I can't concentrate or relax my mind to do it. I can no longer pray for these people, every time I try, my mind goes blank, or I'll see a bird or something that is more interesting to me than praying for these people. I want to get my soul right with God, I just can't get past the seething anger I feel towards these people. I am at a crossroad and I do not know what to do. This anger is quickly becoming a part of me like a finger or a rib. I need coping skills really badly. I don't like the person it's making me, I don't like how I feel and mostly I don't like how it is aging me and how I hardly EVER smile or even laugh anymore.

Angry work rant,"Ok, so i have been keeping this pent up for awhile so its time to blow before i snap... I really dont understand how some people have or keep their jobs. I work retail in a grocery store i have been there for 5 years and it amazes me how some of my coworkers got thier job and how they manage to keep it. Half the time i feel like im back in high school with all the rumors on who's sleeping with who. 
But what is really pissing me off right now is that fact that im working 3 different departments in the same week sometimes 2 departments in one day, busting my ass and pushing through extreme pain and very little sleep to prove that im not the mistake and screw up that some people are making me out to be. Now granted it may take me a little bit to get the hang of something new but once i do i get it done in half the time it takes everyone else. 
Today i was asked by the manager of the one department if i remeber how to do party trays, i said yeah mostly why. She proceded to tell me that i have to get 2 trays done tomorrow for 138 people cause her back up doesnt know how to them. So heres the problems in having: 1 if this person doesnt know the job after being there for 2 1/2 years what the hell is she doing in that positon in the first place and why the hell aint the manager training her. 2. I started out in that department and was there for 3 years before this girl showed up and i was the one that trained her i know she knows how to do them but yet im the one that got a cut in hours so she could go full time back up after being there under a year!!!!! And now you wanna come to me to bail your asses out. What is wrong with picture?? 
The manager spends more time talking then she does working and then wants to bitch cause work aint getting done fast enough well stop talking and work for god sake. Then we have two other managers who throw hissy fits and skids at each other and dont get reprimanded for it even though someone could have gotten hurt in that malay but i get written up for not tagging product that was back stock for the next day that i ran out of time to tag??!

Got Angry At My Kids,"Hey,
I'm not sure if this belongs here. Most likely. I just need to write it out.
I lost my shit at my kids today and I feel horrible. I'm a single dad and my kids are 7 & 9 and I have them 50%.
I have historically had a bad temper. Slow to get there, but when I do it can be like BANG. I have been working really hard on being mindful of how I'm feeling and talking to my kids rather than just going straight to anger and aggression. It's been good and I think I've been doing great. 
This morning, before I even got out of bed my kids woke me up 4 times before my alarm went off. When I don't get enough sleep I become a complete asshole. They wake up at around 6am which is an hour before my alarm. When they wake up, I usually hear them and close my door, no biggie. This morning my oldest wakes me up and asked me if I had wrapped a gift that he wants to give to a school friend, no biggie. Next my youngest came in just as I fell back to sleep to ask if he could sleep in my bed this coming weekend when they're here next, also no biggie, but I was starting to feel frustrated and asked if we could talk about it when I got out of bed.
Next, about 15 minutes before my alarm was set to go off, my youngest came in again and wanted to ask me a question and I lost my shit on him. This isn't the first time that I have lost my shit when they wouldn't stop waking me up. I feel horrible, I literally screamed at him and he started bawling (who wouldn't). After I got up and lectured them on not waking me up so often in the morning before my alarm.
At this point I was way too worked up to go back to sleep, so I stayed up, had a shower, cooled off and then apologised to both of them for how angry I got and how wrong and inappropriate it was. 
 I've been under a lot of stress lately. I'm trying to quit smoking and I'm on day 3 of not smoking, I haven't had a lot of sleep over the last few nights, and last week I lost a work contract that was my main income. 
I think the most frustrating part is I've been doing really great at keeping my cool and then this happens. I feel like I don't deserve my kids and that they would be better off without me. 
I'm really feeling shitty these days and I'm not sure how to handle it. I know I should talk to someone, but cost to see a therapist is very expensive. 
Anyway, I just needed to get it out there.",anger-management

Is my wife bi-polar?,"Hi everyone,

as this is my first foray into online support groups I'm not quite sure how to approach this...I want to give all of the details so that I can paint the picture as best I can for anyone who reads this, but I'm sure that none of you want to read a novel of pain so I'll try to be as succinct as possible.

My wife and I got married in November in Santa Barbara at the court house grounds after a little over a year and a half together.  She's originally from Germany and many of her friends and family came from overseas to be there for us.  It was an incredible day and one that I will always hold dear to my heart.
We are both actors in Los Angeles and I'm also a writer and a stand-up comic.  Money has been and still is very tight for us (as is the case with most artists) and it was something that would cause little hiccups here and there but nothing all that drastic, we would always find a way.  I knew in the first month that we were together that this was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  And my timing was convienant because her visa was up in February of 2020.

After about three months together in July of 2018 she moved in and shortly after that during an emotional moment between us I told her that I was going to marry her.  It wasn't something I planned on saying, it just kind of came out of me in this moment of deep love and connection.  She never asked me to marry her so she could stay, she never even suggested it.  She said that if she had to go back to Germany that it would be ok.  Fast forward a wonderful year and we began planning how we were going to get married and when.  Initially we were going to elope so that we could be legally married but save the pageantry for another time.

Those plans changed multiple times to the point that we ended up having the medium sized wedding that we had both always wanted.  As I said the day could not have been better, I married the love of my life and my best friend in the entire world, I was over the moon.  After her friends went back to Germany and it was just her and I in the studio apartment we share in LA things began to change a bit.  Not so drastically that I would notice there was some big underlying problem, but enough that I knew that she was at the very least uneasy.

There were wonderful days in there, some of the best of our relationship.  But she would always let me know when I was doing something that was making her happy, or if I was disappointing her.  It was hard because all of them were very vague.  She would tell me that this was a really great day but would be specific about what was great about it.  Or she would tell me that it was a bad day or moment and wouldn't tell me what was bad about it.  I was left to guess if I was 'behaving' in an appropriate fashion or not which caused me to walk on eggshells afraid of her having an emotional outburst.

This is something that started happening more frequently.  She would pick fights with me seemingly out of nowhere, and half the time they would be about random stuff that we had no business arguing about.  I even had to let her know the stuff that I was willing to discuss and the stuff that I wasn't willing to engage her in. Throughout all of this I never doubted if we were right for each other or not.  I have never connected with someone on such a deep level (friend or otherwise) in my entire life.  I just thought 'it's ok this is just how she is, I can handle her.'  The whole reason she came to LA in the first place was to act and a big piece of that was getting her SAG card.  She worked really hard to get eligible for it only to almost immediately change her plans after she reached that goal.

After that is was something else, another goal that she had to reach that once she got it would magically cure her unhappiness.  Again, this whole time I was just thinking that she was going through some stuff and it would resolve itself as it always had.  After all she was working on herself spiritually and emotionally (at least it seemed that way) and would constantly have new epiphanies almost on the daily.  I'd come home and she'd say 'I figured out why...(whatever the thing was) is happening, its because of (x,y,z).'  This was music to my ears because I knew that she would be in a better mood for a little while.

Then there were moments that made me feel a little bit uneasy myself.  There were days when she would be all bubbly and sweet but I could tell that they weren't genuine, that she was putting on some kind of an act.  I didn't understand why she felt like she had to act around me and I called her out on it only for her to tell me that it was 'all in my mind.' Let the gaslighting commence!  Once Covid started things took a drastic turn.  She would have periods of time where she would not initiate sex with me, and she would spend a lot of time checking herself out in the mirror, something that she previously almost never did.

She started to tell me more frequently that she needed her alone time, which I completely undestood under the circumstances.  I mean you put too people in tight quarters during a global pandemic and I don't care how much they love each other there is going to be some tension, and there was.  Thankfully my mom lives in Orange County so if she needed a little space for a few days I could easily come here and give it to her.  What started shortly after this was her ever changing rationale for why she was so upset.  Honestly there is a laundry list of things that came up, but the one that I remember the most is she didn't have her own space to make music in our apartment.  Keep in mind that we do live in a small studio so trying to make that kind of space is tricky to say the least.

But it did it for her, no questions asked.  I reconfigured the whole apartment so that she could have the space that she wanted.  When that wasn't enough, the issue came up again that the apartment never felt like hers because she moved in with me and we didn't get a place together.  Again I thought ok fair enough then lets try to find a new place where we both have equal footing and maybe a little more space.  Shortly after that she had another emotional outburst and said that she 'drastically needed to have some time alone.'  This time it felt a little more serious, but I tried to not take it personally because after all this situation we are in as a society right now is so unpredictable that emotions are running high, particularly for someone who doesnt' call America home.

When I arrived at my mom's place I had an emotional breakdown for the first time about my relationship.  It was random and I didn't really know specifically why it happened when it did because nothing had ended at that point.  I was just staying apart from her for less than a week.  Perhaps my gut knew more than my mind did at the time.  After a few days we reconciled as she told me that it was a 'healing process' for her.  We resumed our relationship and things seemed fine again.  Sex life was good, we were going on walks, writing, talking, drinking, the whole nine.  We started talking one night and somehow it got to talking about separating.  She kept saying that she was wanting to go back to Germany for a while to 'find herself.'  I told her that I supported her in doing that and that I would give her the time and space that she needed.

Where this gets even more complicated is the fact that we are currently waiting for our interview for her Green Card and if she were to leave the country right now she would be forfeiting it along with the thousands of dollars and lawyer fees and everything she's put into it so far.  She was still a bit conflicted about that part but was strongly considering leaving mostly because she didn't want to feel the 'pressure' of being a 'wife.'  She even asked that we stop referring to ourselves as husband and wife.  She told me that she felt cheated out of a 'real' engagement as we were only engaged for a short time before the wedding and because I couldn't afford to get her the ring that she wanted.

To be clear she never asked for an expensive ring (the one we were going to get was an aquamarine that was around 1000 dollars) but at the time I didn't have the money and I told her that we would get it eventually.  I take full responsibitly for that.  I know that she wanted to be able to be engaged and share that experience with her friends and family and I cheated her our of that.  What I didn't know was that her resentment towards over that fact would hang over our relationship for the duration of it.  The timeline going forward is a bit of a blur right now because we have gone through this process of me moving out of my apartment four different times, but I'm doing my best to try and differentiate between the times it happened and what went on in between, but I digress...I couldn't really bear staying in the apartment with her knowing that in a short period of time we were going to separate.  So I packed up my shit in my truck and came to my mom's again.

This time it was about a week before she called me and told me that she made a mistake and that she was more 'clear' now and wanted me to come home.  Since I'm so incredibly good at doing what I'm told I believed that she had processed whatever she needed to process and that the coast was clear.  I came home again, moved all my stuff back in and prepared to continue on this journey with my new wife.  I even started planning on doing an surprise elopement with the ring that she wanted.  Things were equally good and bad during the next two weeks until the one morning I woke up after a long night or arguing feeling that there was something lingering in the air.  We talked over coffee and she again basically said that she was going to go back to Germany but also wanted to stay in the relationship with me.

She told me that she wanted to 'prioritize' her art over our relationship and talked ad naseum about how she needed 'her own space.' Even suggesting at one point that I come to Germany and live in a separate apartment.  Obviously I said no to this insane idea, not knowing that she was deliberately throwing ideas at me that I wouldn't agree to so that she could get me to end the relationship and then she wouldn't need to feel guilty about it.  I told her 'sorry, you don't just get to pop in and out of my life whenever you feel like it.'  I almost forgot to mention that she referred to herself as a 'leaf in the wind' and kept saying over and over that she wasn't sure about anything.  Call me crazy but I kind of want my 'wife' (oops I used the word) to be in my life in more than just a passing sense.

I told her that I thought that we just needed a clean break so that she could go live her life back home with her friends and family and she wouldn't have to worry about me or my mom ever again (I forgot to mention that she and my mom were incredibly close which she also resents me for somehow).  She said that she just needed some time back home putting our whole relationship in limbo once again. So for the third time I packed up all of my stuff barely having the strength to put one foot in front of the other and through so many tears I could hardly see five feet in front of me and came BACK to my mom's place knowing full well that our relationship was on life support.  The first day that I was here she texted me and told me that she would be leaving in about three weeks and asked if I would like to see her off.  

I said that I didn't as it would be too hard for me.  She said that she understood and we would see what the future holds for our relationship.  I spoke to her father and her grandmother and they both expressed to me how sorry they were about the whole situation and asked if we were planning on getting divorced.  I said that we weren't but that we were taking a good amount of time apart.  A couple of days after that she voice texted me and told me that she wasn't going to beat around the bush anymore and that it was indeed 'over.'  I dropped the phone and fell on my hands and knees sobbing uncontrollably for I don't know how long.  Thankfully my mom woke up and did her best to comfort me.

I stayed up all night watching videos about relationships and reading articles trying desperately to understand where things went wrong.  I drove to Laguna Beach to watch the sunrise only the whole beach was closed so I just drove around for hours aimlessly talking to friends on the phone just trying to keep it together.  It was 730am and the only thing that I knew is that I wanted to drink so I stopped at a liquor store and got a bottle of champagne and some orange juice because I wasn't sure if I could handle straight whiskey at that time in the AM.  Side note, if you haven't sobbed into a goblet of mimosas before I suggest you try it, it's quite the experience.  After polishing that off in a matter of about 45 minutes the anger over the whole situation began to arise in me.  Specifically at her mother and step father who have been trying to sabotage or relationship from the very beginning.

I've already written way more than I planned so if any of you want to dip out at this point I completely understand and thank you for reading thus far, but I have to explain the mother in law situation really quick for some context.  Her mother is Chinese and her father is Finnish and she is an exactly half of both culturally as well.  Her mother is very controlling and manipulative and basically runs her life from afar.  Her step dad is in lockstep with her mother and the two of them as a team are formidable as far as incfluencing my wife's emotions and her decision making.  Lately the person that I feel I have been interacting with is not her, but her mother and step father.  They are the type of people who when my wife calls them and tells them that she's scared they respond with 'you should be.'  Maybe it a cultural thing, but I grew up in an environment where when I called my family and told them I was scared they would say 'I'm here for you, lets figure it out together.'

So...back to my anger with her mother...I decided that I was going to voice text my wife and tell her how upset I was about how she's being influenced to doubt me and our relationship.  After a couple of angry texts we both calmed down and it actually opened up a really nice dialog between us.  We were talking more honestly and deeply than we had since the very beginning of our relationship.  We were honestly exploring where things went wrong and we committed to one another to do everything that we can to fix them.  For two weeks we talked for hours every single day and I had never been more hopeful that we were actually getting somewhere in fixing our issues.  In fact three days ago she was talking to me about taking a vacation together and about house sitting for our mutual friends for a month.  I had every reason to believe that we were going on the right path.  I had no delusions that it was going to be a challenge to fix 'us' but I was up for it and it seemed that she was as well.  My plan was to come home on the 27th of May as I had been gone at this point for nearly a month.  If you remember way back in the story the last blow up was on May 1st.

She called me on Saturday the 23rd telling me that she had been not feeling well physically for the past few days and that she missed me and wanted me to come home early.  I expressed to her (as I had a week prior) that I didn't want to do the whole 'relapse' thing that people do when they are going though a breakup.  If we were going to reconcile this time there had to be real structural changes in both of us so that we could rebuild a healthy and happy union.  She agreed and assured me that was the case.  So with a new lease on life and being ready and willing to do the work to get back to a place of peace and happiness I packed up my truck AGAIN and drove it back up to Los Angeles to reconnect with my wife.  Once I got there she bounded downstairs and hugged and kissed me as I began moving back into our apartment.  When I walked in the door I noticed a stack of about nine boxes against the wall.  I offhandedly said 'well this is awkward' trying to make light of the situation.

And honestly I thought that she just hadn't unpacked from when she was going to leave the first time so I didn't make much of it at first sight.  After moving most of my stuff back in I finally asked 'so what's in the boxes then?' To which she responded 'pretty much everything.'  Obviously confused and upset I said 'you changed your mind from yesterday?'  Keep in mind that she had only the day before talked about vacationing and house sitting.  She responded 'I told you that I was going to take the month to decide what I was going to do and I've made my decision.'  I asked her when she was planning on leaving and she said 'sometime in July.'  She then told me that she thought that we could still live together for the next two months assuming that we could have some sort of normal relationship knowing that she was going to leave at the end of it...I'm not built that way.

She again suggested that we have a long distance relationship and even speculated that we would see each other four to five months out of the year.  I'm not entirely sure that I got married to spend the majority of the year away from my wife while she lives in another country.  And as I mentioned money is pretty tight right now so the assumption that I'm going to have the time and money to travel back and forth to Germany several times a year is misguided at best.  The funny part is that even though I'm a third generation Californian and all of my friends and family are here I was willing to move to Germany for her.  Had she looked me in the eye and said 'Shaelan I love you and I want to be with you, come with me to Germany and lets build our lives together.' I absolutely would have said yes.  She didn't say that though.  What she said was ""if I don't stay here, and you don't come to Germany there's no reason for us to be married.""  Those two statements are a little far apart in tone wouldn't you say?  She also told me that she's been feeling this way for about a year, but apparently that information wasn't important enough to share before spending 9000 dollars on a wedding, or pulling me back in to break my heart on four separate occasions.

I then told her that I don't feel like I can rely on her for anything right now and she agreed saying, 'no you cant.' After once again reminding me that she didn't want to be a wife, that she wanted to 'date' me.  As I had no interest in being experimented on for the next couple of months while she figures out her situation I decided that once again it was in my best interest to leave the apartment and come back to my mom's place until she leaves.  So two hours after moving back into my apartment for the fourth time I moved back out again.

Yesterday she texted my mom to tell her that she was sorry and that she never meant to hurt anyone.  She also informed her that she would be leaving the apartment on or around June 1st so that I can move back in.  The moment I walk back into that apartment and I don't see her or any of her stuff is the thing I'm most terrified of in the entire world.  Just imagining what that will be like right now is causing me to completely lose my mind.  I feel like I'm dying, I can't stop sobbing and I don't know what I'm going to do.  If you read all the way through this and you have any thoughts or advice or even just a small hug I'd sure appreciate it.  Thank you all for listening.

With love,

Bipolar Boyfriend,"Hey everyone! So this is my first ever online support experience and I'm very hopeful for some insight into bipolar relationships. I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half now. He was very straightforward with me about his bipolar and his struggles with it. I have anxiety and depression so I was very understanding and have tried to research and learn all I can about it. He's finally got his meds right and he is pretty stable most of the time. He suffers from the depression side of it mostly. My questions lie in how he copes with that. He literally shuts off from everyone. He won't talk to me for a couple of days. He won't touch me or be intimate in any way. If I get upset, he gets defensive. I always approach the subject gingerly and calmly but it seems like nothing I can say is understood. I understand his need for space and I'm usually ok with it but it seems to be more and more recently. To the point it feels like we aren't even a couple. And he expects me to just to act like my normal happy self like nothing has changed. That's hard. I ask him to please consider my feelings and he says when he is in this state that he doesn't think about anyone but himself and can't help it. I'm just looking for insight, encouragement, or helpful tips? I never want to give up on him but I also know a healthy relationship can't be so one-sided. I'm just at a loss I guess. Thanks for listening. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Today is a bad day,"My mother is having a manic episode and I'm beyond exhausted. I have dealt with this alone for so many years and then I shut down letting others take the reins. All they see is that I checked out and have their own narrative.
A little background:
I knew there a mental looming over my mother for years as a teenager then manifest after when she had a deadline that was beyond stressful. Staying up and being understaffed for the business. I am the oldest child and have felt like I've been the mother forever. She has been a good mother providing, nurturing and did the best she could. Working 2 and 3 jobs to provide then started a successful business which I worked in as a teenager (in high school, vocational school and running the business all at the same time crazy hours). The vocational school helped her out with her business.  So I stay in the profession for her. She brought a home and created a better life for us. Because i was working for her, I would get paid every now and then. I graduated high school, vocational school, was attending college and running the family business. Working crazy hours, dropped out of college for her business never pursued my goals. I got burnt out and she asked me to find an apartment due to my attitude. (I was the responsible and good kid never in trouble. Rule follwer)
I got my own place. She fussed about that I went out and got the apt after she had told me to. Then due to life, burnout and the recession. She lost everything. I opened my home to her (20yrs no kids, working and couldn't enjoy my college experience). I dropped out of college to support her vision. She was diagnosed  and wouldn't take her meds. She had to stay with me but I had get an extra job to support my household. In and out of the hospital. The last straw so her coming up to my jobs and I almost lost my job. I was also contacted by federal law enforcement. I literally lost it and I've never been disrespectful to my mother. I told her that she could no longer stay with me. I took a break from her and I had so much peace.
She began staying with a friend. Had a few episodes and got help. They placed her on meds, put her on disability because she couldn't function, moving like an 80yr old due meds and got better. They changed her meds, then she gained weight 30lbs. Changed her meds again to where she was functioning a lot better. Now she wont take them. It's a cycle. I'm so exhausted. I haven't been able to live my life until she left and now I'm back to not being to live my life. 
I'm starting to have health problems because of the stress and I'm only 30. I desire a family of my own but this illness and her not wanting to stay on this low dosage medication is not allowing me. I don't know what to do

Exhausted by my mother,"My mother is bipolar with psychosis. She used to be fully functionalShe has been in an emotional crisis for 4 months straight. She has had 4 hospitalizations and every day seems to get worse. She has lost more than 30 pounds, she cannot walk, she cannot do anything by herself (I have to bathe her, feed her, entertain her, give her meds etc.) and she WILL NOT SLEEP. She is screaming CONSTANTLY without any reason. Nothing keeps her quiet and she will not let me do anything. I am a grad student, taking 29 credits and she will simply not let me study. She will just demand attention by screming or trowing herself off the bed. She wont let me sleep, I am exhausted, I'm frustrated, im angry and I dont know what else to do? She is just not getting better. I feel my life is stuck, I wont be able to finish my studies and make nothing for myself because of her...",family-friends-of-bipolar
I don’t know how to deal with bipolar mother.,"This is my first post. My mom was verbally and physically abusive to me as a child. I moved out of the house at 16. My father died when I was 18 and she pulled over on the interstate and physically kicked me out of the car so that I missed his funeral. She’s terrible in times of stress but there are times where we can go On an outing and actually get along even though these times seem to get rarer as she ages.  We go through long periods of not speaking. I’m almost 40 with 3 young children and I’ve been trying to have a decent relationship with her for the kids sake. She’s pretty much the only extended family we live near and the kids love her. Though my oldest (7) is starting to notice her mood swings and general meanness. She fights with everyone. Her sister and son haven’t spoken to her in years and that has strained my relationship with them. They avoid my kids birthday parties just so they don’t have to see her. She fights with all her neighbors, her coworkers, her church, government agencies... pretty much everyone she comes into contact with but of course, it’s everyone else’s fault. Her rants about all these things are so draining and then she gets mad at me and says no one supports her and I’m always snarling at her. I get these ridiculously long emails from her written at all hours of the night and early morning venting her frustrations at me and the world. I feel like I’m still being verbally abused. It also makes me doubt myself. Am I not empathetic? Do I only think about myself? Have I exaggerated how bad my childhood was? Im not very patient with her and I do snap easily at her.  
In the past 2 years, I’ve been having panic attacks, and avoiding driving which is inadvertently hurting my homeschooled children. I often have an overwhelming feeling that I’m doing something wrong, or that I’m going to get in trouble, or make someone mad.  My husband does so much for us but just cannot understand having come from a near perfect family. Sometimes I think I should cut her off because she is toxic. But the kids get sad when she doesn’t come around for awhile and even though her help is very limited, it is the only help we get with the kids (babysitting for a short time or being with me in the car for excursions).  She won’t get professional help or take meds. Most of the time, she denies she was ever diagnosed.  I found someone to go talk to in January but even spending the money on therapy gives me anxiety. I’m so tired of this cycle. I wish she would have some self awareness, stop being so narcissistic, and I could stop walking on eggshells when she’s around. I’m tired of fighting and then being down for hours instead of present and focused on my children. She makes my heart ache and I wish I didn’t give her that much power over me.",family-friends-of-bipolar
Acting Like An Animal?,"Has anyone ever experienced a loved one with bipolar disorder who also has psychotic breaks?
Like for example at her absolute worst my mom likes to crawl into the closet in the dark and growl at me. A few weeks ago she started screeching incoherently when she got upset.
I know she has bipolar disorder for sure, but I also think she must have some kind of narcissistic personality as well.

Bipolar questions,"Hi! I'm 16 years old. I really don't know exactly what to say, but i do think that bipolar disorder is something i might have to question for myself. i was told that bipolar isn't generally diagnosed to people under the age of 18, but i do have it they just can't give me a diagnosis. my mom is bipolar, my grandma, and her family, plus my dads side has some serious bipolar issues as well. i don't know many details, but i can start by telling you my story. my mom left her job a few years ago. since then, she has gotten very sick. she has fibromyalgia, or some kind of chronic illness. she doesn't have a direct diagnosis. she rarely leaves the house, maybe two or three times a week at most. she sleeps most of the day, and wakes up in the evening to get dinner together in some way, and she takes care of our pets throughout the day. now, my mother is potentially the most loving person i know, she loves me and my brothers so much and that has never ever been something i question. she is my best friend. but i'm so worried about her. like it makes my stomach hurt to think about because i'm so worried she's not ok. i know this is a lot to read and there's so much more i could say but please leave any advice/thoughts/stories in the comments. <3 (i didn't read this after i tyler it so sorry for any mistakes) ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Anyone Else Greive A Living Family Member,"
Does anyone else struggle with grieving a mother, or any other loved one, who is still alive?

 The want/need for mother/daughter closeness, like that you see in movies or in your friend and relatives relationships. My middle sister and I spent many years in a very volatile and damaging environment due to my mother’s mental illness going undiagnosed from the time I was 11 to 19, and, of course, the eventual deterioration of my parent’s marriage.  Mom began to change when my father went through [and survived] cancer and my oldest sister, at 15, left home the day he returned home from the hospital. Two very stressful events for anyone to have to cope with.  I think my childhood prior to that was fairly normal, that’s why it was so traumatizing when it did a complete 180.  Our calm, safe home environment quickly became a distant memory.

Mom spent every waking moment for about 3.5 years screaming and berating my father, she blamed him for my sister, who was completely allergic to conforming to rules and self-centered (she still is, but now a highly narcissistic mother as well), left home. It was ugly. It was crazy. And every waking moment is not an exaggeration, there was seldom a quiet night’s sleep in our home, so much so, I had to get a sick note to pass 8th grade. Police stopped by on the regular, my father was charged with assault, when he was in fact the victim, and Child Services were involved in our lives on more than one occasion. One traumatizing event would occur that you barely had time to process before the next occurred – could probably write a book and it would be a psychological thriller best-seller.  

Dad eventually pursued a relationship outside of their marriage, something my sister and I discovered and hid from Mom. More dysfunction. Following the divorce, the main focus in our home, where we remained with Mom, was dad’s affair. She hated him, obsessed over hating him, and to have her acceptance, I felt like I had to hate him too. Further enforced by the abuse, both physical and verbal, we would receive anytime we returned from spending time with him.  If we didn’t hate him?  Well, that’s because he brainwashed us, naturally. To be truthful, I did hate him. Not for what he had done to her, however, I resented him for leaving us with her. He was unemployed at the time and living in a small upstairs bedroom at my grandfather’s. I still resented him.  

When I was 25 and my grandfather passed away, I finally recognized why I had always went bouts of writing dad off, I felt like to have mom’s love, I had to.  When I explained this to Dad, he said I know that, just asked that I try to be mindful of it so as to not let it continue. Meanwhile, all those years, I felt like I had a healthy, close relationship with my mom. It was only after moving out of province and being clear of the situation for years that I realized, I hadn’t. Aferall, they say, you can’t heal in the same environment that made you sick. You see, I had learned how to work around mom’s irrational behaviours and moods, by compliance, agreement, and tending to HER needs. My sister and I felt responsible for her and her well-being.  I had lived in denial for years, convincing myself my relationship with my mom, was something it was not, when the fact was I had been grieving my mother, the mother I felt I was cheated out on,  since I was 11 years old.

 

In healthy relationships, you can communicate your feelings to a person, validate them, work through them, however, because of Mom’s mental illness, [she was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder by the time was 19, although, I believe it to be more schizoaffective, as there is always psychosis, delusions, and irrationality during mania], to protect HER feelings, never mind healing all of ours, together, as a family,  we don’t talk about it or the years of pain we endured due to it. Even 20 years later, she still seethes with hate and ridicules my father.

 In recent years, when she approached me with her living in the past and vicious rants about my father, with having a new healthy outlook I’ve asked her not to discuss it with me and respect  my boundaries. To which I was met with her she flying off the handle, “boundaries? I’m your mother!”.  Yes, mom, I discovered those handy little tools. Having kept my mouth shut for so long and no longer willing to be compliant, I calmly told her that my sister and I had already lived through their marriage, and we tired of reliving it, it was traumatizing and they both hurt us. Not just our father. Time to move on.  She lost her mind and I was verbally attacked and called complete dirt. I don’t respond to anger with anger, or words I can’t take back. I asked her to leave my home. She spent the months following sending me nasty texts, to which I ignored. We’ve since reconciled, though, nothing was discussed to allow for a healthy resolution, we’re just being cordial.

 

While it hurts, I don’t resent her, but I will however always grieve the mother I feel I was cheated out on. I’ve accepted it for what it is and acknowledge the fact we will never be able to effectively discuss and resolve the many years of hurt…hurt, which I’ve come to realize for what it is, abuse. Do I envy friends or movies that exemplify the mother/daughter relationship I desperately yearned for? Absolutely. A part of me always will.

My suicidal bipolar sister take 3,"AGAIN she is claiming to be so depressed that she wants to kill herself. She isn't on meds, she self medicated with weed and alcohol. She gets high or drink and sends nasty texts to me telling me I'm just a price of shit basically. Nitpicking every little detail even things that have happened 18 years ago (we are 36 years old. Fraternal (thank goodness) twins). I can't take the verbal abuse anymore it's maddening. I stopped calling or reaching out because I'm met with negative responses from her. She is stressing my dad out by calling him all the time and talking about suicide and how she is depressed etc. She is going through a hard time most of her relationships are strained where she lives due to her toix behavior. She never sees anything wrong with her actions and everyone else is the problem. My dad called memlast night asking for help and for me to call suicide line again and local police, so I did! Suicide hot line was a freaking joke. The guy said he will call her when he gets a moment because he has to answer incoming calls first before outgoing calls. She moved I didn't have her new address and called poilce who dis not have her current address and refused to ping her cell phone. She sent nasty text messages saying I was trying to get her into trouble by calling police and suicide hotline. I didn't let her know that my dad was the one asking me to do so as she would have lashed out at him and he doesn't need anymore bullshit from her. 

I guess im just venting to people who I know will understand how hard it is to have a family member who is meantally I'll and bipolar at that which makes it hard. I have cut her off officially today no more responding to her text messages I don't want to but I feel I have no choice. I have to set boundaries on my health and I can't take her toxicity. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
bipolar mother’s house of cards is about to fall," This is my first post. My mother was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder years ago. She uses it as an excuse when she’s being manipulative and denies it completely other times. She was both physically and emotionally abusive when my siBlings and I were growing up. My youngest sister still lives with her and is 17.
About 20+ years ago, my paternal grandparents purchased a house for us in our home town. My parents divorced before I remember them ever being together my my grandparents on my father’s side co-raised me and my brother. Prior to that we were three kids and my mother and stepdad in a tiny two bed apartment. My mother rented the home from my grandparents. My mother had four kids. I am the oldest. She threw each of us (save my youngest sister but she’s got one more year...)out like clockwork at the age of 18 by throwing everything we had on the front lawn and screaming about how worthless we were. My stepdad (father of my youngest sister) completely bailed about 5 years ago.
My relationship with my mother has had its ups and downs, but I have generally stayed away from our old home that is still owned by my paternal grandparents. Last winter, one of my brothers went to the house and discovered that my mother and sister were living in absolute squalor. Cat shit everywhere, carpet completely ruined,dilapidated everything. My mother stopped paying the utilities it was the middle of winter, with a northern Illinois polar vortex! No electricity, no gas, no heat. The pipes froze weeks prior to that and she told no one. She just got angry at my poor brother who had to fix all of the damage that was caused while she told him that he was worthless and never helps her and that she’ll never forgive him....for fixing the mess she made....
Thought that things were better and come to find out last week, she never got the gas turned back on and still has no heat. It’s January! Turns out she let the gas bill go so long that they removed the meter from the house and wouldn’t put it back u til the owner of the house, my grandpa, contacted them. She never told them and my poor grandparents knowing what they are dealing with don’t check on the place because honestly she’s a nightmare. They allow this for my sister who they look at as their granddaughter even though she is not related to them. What’s worse is that she has not paid them rent in over a year.
my family has reached a breaking point with her. My grandpa is putting all the utilities in his name and told her that she will pay all of it or she will have to leave. I am so afraid that she just won’t do it. 
My mother’s symptoms are so hard to deal with. She holds a regular job and can feign normalcy for others. Her mania is more in the way of grandiose thinking with little to no action taken. She does spend frivolously, but her depression takes over and she can do absolutely nothing. She has the money to pay her bills, she just doesn’t. If she is confronted about it she just slides in to all of her old manipulative emotionally abusive tactics. She won’t get help and she won’t listen to anyone. She has had someone taking care of her her whole life and now she is facing homelessness. It’s been years since she’s had to face the facts about her illness and I know that this will just lead to her threatening suicide. I know more now then I did when I was just a little girl watching my mom down a bottle of Advil then make her self throw it up a few minute later. she has never been hospitalized for her illness, but if she makes one threat i’m Calling 911 and completing a petition for it.
Just getting this shit off of my chest. Sorry for the discombobulated narrative. This is all hitting right now and I am trying to make sense of it myself. Thanks for reading.",family-friends-of-bipolar
What do I do?,"I have a 78 yr old mother with schitzoaffective bipolar disorder. She lives 2 hours away and is in the process of recovering from breast cancer. Her doctors are in the town I live in so for every appointment my husband and I have to drive 2 hrs to pick her up, 2 hrs to take her home and then 2 hrs for us to get back home. We have happily (mostly) juggled this for her. She was having trouble managing her finances so I offered to manage them for her. Unfortunately this resulted in multiple calls and texts daily from her fretting over what's going on, why I'm paying what I am, etc. etc. I finally just gave it back to her. Now she is still pestering me daily as she has messed up everything I had in place to keep her financially comfortable and whines about how confused she is. 
We didn't speak for many years and I was truly doing so well mentally without her presence in my life but when she got sick it fell to me to help her. She seemed to be doing better about gratitude and apologies for a while there but she also had a long conversation with my brother yesterday (who does nothing to assist in her care or ever call to check on her) and proceeded to complain and judge me, my relationship with my husband (who takes off work and drives for hours to help her), and my children and their choices. I'm not sure why my brother tells me this stuff and although my head knows it is her mental illness talking, my heart hurts. It seems like despite trying to distance myself emotionally from her disease, I apparently have let myself get ""sucked in"" again and now have an emotional investment in our relationship.
I can't sleep, I am over eating, I don't exercise anymore, I smoke and drink too much. I don't know what to do. All of my bad behaviors didn't begin overnight, they just slipped up on me until last night when I realized that she was pulling me down in her quagmire again after I worked so hard to pull out of it. 
I am at a loss. I feel awful while she's in my life but I feel guilty when I cut her off because she truly does need the help. Any helpful advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",family-friends-of-bipolar
Father has been bipolar since I was a young girl,"My father is a great man. He’s funny, he’s nice, and is hardworking. I can’t exactly remember when I began to think that my dad was mentally ill but I was very young(I am 21 years old now). Growing up my father was never really there emotionally. He provided for us financially and always made sure we had everything we needed but he was never really there for me as a father figure. It was very difficult growing up with a bipolar father because I would see the relationships that my friends had with their fathers. Every summer that passes he spends it as a ghost. He is depressed through the summer months and it’s heart breaking watching him not be able to get out of bed. He has low energy and is not fully there during these months. However, in the winter it’s a different story. He has high levels of energy, acts irrationally, talks a 100 miles a minute, and goes days without sleeping much. My mother has had to deal with this her entire life and I applaud her because it is emotionally exhausting for my siblings and I. Once we turned 18 we moved out because it was draining to our lives. I love my father but I know that he is sick and needs help. The problem is that he refuses to get help. Last week he went to a psychiatrist and she prescribed him some medication for bipolar disorder. My family and I thought this was a step in the right direction finally but after just a week my dad said he was not taking the pills anymore because he didn’t like how it made him feel. He began acting irrationally and was screaming at my mom saying that there is nothing wrong with him and everyone just thinks he’s crazy but he’s not. My sister called him to check on him and he called her crazy and hung up the phone. We’re honestly just lost and do not know what to do at this point. It’s been years of having to deal with this and us trying to convince my dad to get help but he is very old fashioned and does not believe that medication is good for your body. I’m scared that hes becoming more angry and is driving everyone that cares about him away. Does anyone have any advice? How do I cope with this? It’s hard for me to explain the situation to other people because I don’t want to paint my father in a bad light because I know he is a good guy but he has caused so much turmoil in our lives. I try to remind myself that he’s sick but it’s also hard to be sympathetic for someone who refuses to get help. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Need advice,"My boyfriend of 2 years has bipolar depression. He was very open to me about it from the beginning of our relationship and tried his best to warn me of certain signs of stages that he goes through. I have also done a lot of research to try to better understand what he goes through on a daily basis. I will never be able to completely understand but i always try my best to be there for him even when i don't understand why he feels what he does. At first he communicated very well and always warned me before he got super down so i would know to expect some changes in the way he acts and feels towards me. Lately, he has been very distant and pushing me away. He barely talks to me anymore to the point where i can't even be there for him anymore. On top of this, we have a long distance relationship. We live 12 hours away from each other so we have to rely on phone communication most of the time. We see each other monthly for a week at a time. Right now, he thinks i don't love him and won't answer me, talk to me, or tell me how he feels. i don't know how to deal with it or what to do because i don't want him to feel like i'm better with out him. he's left me before out of guilt for not wanting to put me through hard times and thinks i deserve better. right now it feels mine our relationship is one-sided and that he puts in no effort but i know it only feels like that right now because of what he has no control over. i'm never going to give up on him, i'm still learning how to deal with it myself just like he is. just need some advice on how to approach this situation. i feel like if i give him space then he will feel like i don't care or love him. but if i keep pushing him to communicate and talk to me he will see i'm stressed and hurting and leave me because he thinks it's his fault and i'm better with out him. He cycles around the end of the year very bad, the rest of the year he's quite stable with only days on occasion that he gets down. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Father told me he did heroin,"Hello all, I recently posted about my dad going into hospital. I have phoned him a few times since to check in with him. This evening I called him and he told me he was allowed out on day release to the shops or to get coffees. He said that he wasn't allowed drink alcohol or smoke weed. I said that's what I always say! He said he had heroin in his system, according to the doctor. This is something I have always thought he had done, based on past behaviours. Anyways, I said to him why would that be there and he said it was because someone spiked his weed. I'm just finding it difficult to digest even though I had always thought it anyway. He willingly lived homeless by choice. I believe that's when he was doing it.  It's just hard, because not a single person I know could empathise with this story. It feels like I'm in a movie. This just doesn't seem realistic. Rant over. Thank you for listening or reading xxxx ",family-friends-of-bipolar
My dad,My dad has bipolar disorder and he suffers from bouts of psychosis. He phoned me at least 5 times a day if not more sometimes. So I've had to block him as it was getting too much for me. I phone him once a week now. But last night my aunty told me that she had gotten him into a psychiatric hospital last night. He has wanted to get into one since March and wasn't able to as they were too crowded. I phoned him to check on him and he was very upset crying on the phone to me and put me on to his doctor. I was absolutely devestated for him. And now I honestly feel depressed. I've been crying a few times this morning. It just makes me so sad. It bothers me because I can't talk to anyone about it. If that was because he was sick physically or injured it would be ok that's fine people accept it. But no one understands mental illness. It breaks my heart. I just wanted to go somewhere where I was understood xx thanks for reading ,family-friends-of-bipolar
Boyfriend is Bipolar,"I've never really made a post before, but my boyfriend is bipolar. I love him but it's been hard the last couple of months. He tried switching his medication and then spiraled because he didn't have medication. Recently he told me that he hasn't been taking his medication because he felt better but now today he slept for like 14 hours because he was tired. I'd love some advice. Should I be allowing him to sleep? I asked him to watch TV with me, something I figured would be low effort, but he didn't want to. I want to give him his space to recover but don't know if I'm actually making this worse. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Bipolar boyfriend,"This could essentially be a lonnnnng post.. I’ll try to keep it somewhat short, and sweet. I came back to Daily Strength in order to find a bit of support and broaden my mind to Bipolar Disorder, as my boyfriend struggles with it.
Basically, our relationship progressed quickly. I fell hard and fast, we lived 60 miles away, but he moved in with me as he got his life together in a new town.. that was in June.. I now find myself taking care of a lot and, although he’s really trying to find a job he likes and such, I feel highly responsible for him. 
We are about to begin couple’s counseling to hopefully work through the relationship issues that have arisen.. When he goes through spells, they last days, if not weeks, and he is very mean to me. Yelling, name calling, critical of a lot of my actions... 
He has described Bipolar to me as a demon that lives within his brain that tells him everything is wrong. He also has severe anxiety so that doesn’t help... I’ve done research and continue to... Anywho, things have just chaotic and I’m trying my best not to blame him for the behavior that isn’t him... 
It’s harder than heck for me to see that lately, I take things personal.. I also have a lot of stress that I can’t go to him about and our fights escalate pretty quickly when that “demon” takes over...
I’m here asking for help, insight, reading material, anything.. because the person I love is tormented, often leaving me feel alone...

Help.  Taking care of mentally abusive mom.,"I’ll try to shorten this as much as possible.  
My mom has always had issues, bipolar as well as a lot of other mental illnesses.  She can’t read or write well.  My dad was the one who always took care of her/dealt with her when I was a teen and I was able to leave and get away.  Now she’s living in a duplex with me because my dad has passed so I’ve taken all of his responsibilities. I pay her bills, I take her to appts, I do everything for her.  She just demands I do this and that for her.  I had to quit my job, stop my semester for college.  She has no family nor do I.  What do I do?  How do I continue letting her treat me like a dog?  It hurts because I know she acts this way because of mental illness and know that deep down somewhere she has to appreciate all that I sacrifice for her.  I just want her to appreciate things.  She’s always yelling at me about everything under the sun.  I have to jump as soon as she calls.  If she has an appt at 11 she will call from 9 on. 9, 9:30, 10 etc getting more angry as time passes.  She never tells me when or where she needs to go.  I’ll take her to an appt and she’ll say “you need to take me to ____ places too” last minute as we’re leaving the appt.  I just don’t know what to do.  The grief of my dad being gone and now me taking all these responsibilities is wearing me down.  Someone has to relate so that I’m not alone?  I can’t abandon her because I do love her.  I do know she loves me.  It’s her mental illness that makes her this way but how do I deal with this? ",family-friends-of-bipolar

Bipolar son,"Trying to find peace with in all the chaos. My 25 yr old son is bipolar, he took off on Monday he bought a one-way ticket to  Saint Augustine. We are from the central Florida area. He is very manic right now. He was up all night Monday. He found someone to give him a room Tuesday night, which was suppose to be on a month to month basis.  That didn’t work out for too long. Her boyfriend didn’t want him there.     Now he’s back on the street. He called me. He was exhausted tired and needed a place to sleep. So I paid for a hotel room just for tonight.   I know I can’t do this again frankly I don’t have the money!  I’m so tired of trying to rescue him.

"Sister having manic episode, need help!","I have bipolar disorder, but have been stable for quite a while now. 
My sister started having a problem at work and it has triggered mania.  She was close to a psychotic break last weekend.  Now all she does is talk about this work problem.  She is totally obsessed with it.  It is all she thinks or talks about.  She has insomnia and has lost about 10 pounds.  She has the typical motormouth and has had crying jags and laughing jags.  She is paranoid and has lost her job and is trying to get the union to help her, but she has all these conspiratory ideas about what has been happening to her at work for the past 7 years.  7 years of complete happiness with her job, by the way.  She has euphoria and grandious thoughts about herself.
She refuses to even talk about the mania with us.  We are at a loss as to how to help her.  I can see that this is just going to lead to disaster, but we need to get her down out of this manic episode. 
Can anyone suggest to me how we can help her?  You would think that me having bipolar, I would be able to help her, but I can't.  I tried to talk to her a couple times, but she doesn't listen and thinks nothing is wrong with her.

Using videoconferencing for patient sessions,"I was wondering if anyone else has family members seeing their doctors using videoconferencing instead of in person? My brother's doctor is currently using a service called hipaavideo.net to hold sessions and I wanted to get feedback from others who may have used this type of service to see doctors or even feedback from any doctors currently seeing patients this way?
I understand the hipaa part of hipaa video is compliance with patient info safety. I guess i'm not as concerned with protection as I am with effectiveness. Anyway, any helpful feedback would be appreciated, thank you.",family-friends-of-bipolar
I don’t know how to cope with a bipolar father,"I am 34 years old, I have a 64 year old father who has been diagnosed and treated for clinical depression but has periods of mania as well. I feel he is bipolar and I have mentioned multiple times I am concerned about the steady decline in his mental health and I have never been taken seriously. He acts like it’s funny. Today my parents (they are divorced but friendly) and I took my two year old daughter to the park and my father was in a stable mood for the beginning of the outing but his mood changed very quickly and he became very agitated, sighing loudly and stomping around. My mother and I both decided to ignore it but as we were walking through the park he was shuffling his feet acting as if he could barely get around (he uses his poor health as an excuse for his changing moods) and it caused him to trip and land on my little girl knocking her to the ground. Her face is scraped and bruised. She cut her lip and it bled terribly, it really scared me. I am afraid to have him around my daughter, I told him he can not see her again until he gets properly medicated. I feel like I need to protect her and I feel guilty for not protecting her better today. He thinks I am keeping my daughter away to punish him. I don’t know how to cope with this situation. His behavior has gotten worse through the years but lately it has been especially bad. He is letting his health decline, he quit getting excercise, he won’t eat properly even though he is diabetic with high blood pressure, he blamed his fall today on his feet hurting from being diabetic but later admitted he was shuffling his feet because he didn’t want to be at the park anymore. The constant mood swings are emotionally exhausting to me and I worry now that my daughter is old enough to start understand behavior it will affect her too. I have lived with his behavior my whole life but didn’t really realize how unhealthy it was until the last few years. My family has always been close so I never imagined cutting off contact but I don’t think I can handle all of the additional stress this relationship brings. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Feeling stuck with a 70+ year old mom,Being raised by my mentally ill single mom has been the defining challenge of my life. As I approach my 50th birthday it is continuing to cloud my entire life. She is living in an unsustainable situation and I fear things are going to come to a head very soon. Basically I fear she will lose her apartment and being in debt will not be able find another place to live. She resists my attempts to help citing her need for independence even as all the signs point to it crashing down soon. We have been fighting all of my life and now as I feel empowered to break the cycle which basically means finding a way to emotionally shield myself from her wholesale anger that always lies just beneath the surface I am in a state of bewilderment. I want to allow myself to feel  whole at all costs but I can’t turn my back on her at her most vulnerable. This has me feeling stuck because I don’t want to abandon her but I don’t know if I can ever heal with the pain I feel every time I talk to her.

Bipolar sister threatening suicide again,"so my dad ctext me and I called him back. My sister has been sending “I should just off myself nobody cares, no one loves me” texts. She gets worse when she is drinking. The alcohol is like a switch for her to just completely loose her cool. She is erratic, I feel like every time I talk to her she is just so angry. I can’t say anything right. I don’t love her, according to her. She wants me to tell her all the time that I’m proud of her and she is amazing. I tell her I thought a lot but it isn’t enough according to her. 
I told my dad to ignore the texts and send the suicide hot line number to her when she is that way. 
My husband a recovering alcoholic I was with him for 12 years before he got 100% sober last 3.5 years have been great, but living with his addiction has left me little room to be able to mentally handle my sister.
i feel guilty. But I don’t know what else to do. If I call her she ignores my calls, she wants to be left alone but gets mad when I don’t call. She won’t take meds. It’s maddening. 
I guess I’m just venting I’m sure you all know how it is when dealing with the ups and downs and manic modes of grandiose ideas and plans then followed by deep deep depression, self medicating, and then the cycle repeats it’s self. I need to learn how to best handle her, because I’m sucking at it. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
My bf is bipolar and I'm hurting...,"I feel so lonely day to day and especially at night bc he doesnt come to bed until 4am. Then I wake up with the 2 kids around 7am oh and I wake up with the baby every night, every time. He never wants to cuddle or talk/hang out with me. Hed rather go down in the basement to his computer all day and night. Or sleep. He never wants to go out and do anything. Not even a walk or dinner.
Today I was pushed over the edge bc he keeps calling me names like stupid and dumb. Then later  hell blame it on his BD. Well I'm over it. There has to be a point of control somewhere. He cant be allowed to say and do these horrid mean things to me and just get away with it bc he is Bipolar. I've been so understanding and try so hard to learn all I can about his BD but he doesnt try to help me, help him. Or help his self. Does anyone have any advice from experience on how to deal with the extreme loneliness?? Or what I can do to make him affectionate towards me again like he was when we started dating. And me being affectionate first doesnt work. He just th tells me to get off or looks at me and says why're you doing. Or if I try to seduce him he just calls me a pervert, which is so immature it turns me off immediately. Help please. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Just waiting for the worst...(long post),"My EAP suggested I come to this site to find support, since there don't seem to be any Women's Groups in my area. So please bear with me, this is kind of my introduction post...
My husband suffers from bipolar 1, childhood based PTSD and ADD. We've been together since 2005 after he helped pull me out of a different toxic relationship. Before we were married in 2013, I helped him get access to doctors to help him get a diagnosis on his bipolar, and we long suspected he had PTSD since he was badly beaten as a child. We got that formerly diagnosed about 1 and a half years ago along with the ADD. That happened after he checked himself in to the hospital for his own saftey. His suicidal thoughts had gotten to be overwhelming due to a bad reaction to his newest meds. And his temp job didn't invite him back after he was released. Since then, he has been unemployed and denied disability. I had to start working longer hours to support us and then that got worse when my student loans came due. I've tried several times to find a therapist that he can connect to, he hates group therapy, I got him a puppy to be his ESA, he is on medication that works, and he has started going back to school, but he's been self-medicating with alcohol...
When he would have a manic episode, I could take the horrible hateful things he would say to me. I could handle the suicide threats that I knew he didn't mean becuase he was, at the moment, out of control. And that as long as I monitored him, and let the episode pass, it would be okay. But then he started drinking as his method of dealing with boredom and cabin-fever being stuck at home alone for most of the day everyday. And he started saying the same hateful hurtful things and again threatening suicide. But something was different. He was still out of control, but it wasn't a manic episode. So it actually hurt. I couldn't just let it wash past. He was finishing 2 big bottles of vodka in a week and a half. He was spending $120 a month on booze. It was hurting us financially as much as it was hurting emotionally.
I recently confronted him about it. And he pushed back hard. He said that I had to come up with something else for him to deal with the boredom or to not get on his case about it. He's hinted that if I would not get mad at him for taking pot or extacy that that would help. I've flat out told him I would be very mad if he started taking drugs so he said I had to let him keep drinking. I stopped responding to him physically, becuase he only showed affection for me when he was drinking. It has messed with my sense of self-worth that he only showed affection or interest when drinking. When he isn't drinking I may as well be his housekeeper, cook, and personal ATM. I explained this to him and initially he said the same horrrible things to me, and said he needed me to let him be intimate to help his own sense of desirability. That I was hurting him by not reciprocating. I am a victim of sexual abuse due to similar manipulation, that was the relationship he pulled me out of. I was devastated that he tried to use that same tactic.
Then he started reducing his drinking a bit and there are occasional days of sobriety. But he seems to think that I will automatically become responsive because he has been dry for 3 days. And when I still don't respond becuase he hasn't apologized or acknowledged that it makes a difference when he says terrible things due to his illnesses versus becuase he became drunk, he accuses me of lying about whats wrong and what he should do. Last night he woke me up at 2 AM and accused me of not really wanting him to get better. He's on the best medication since he was first diagnosed. He is going to school (but not working). He's reduced his drinking by changing to brandy that he sips instead of taking shots of vodka. His newest ADD meds have helped him loose weight so he is in better shape than he has been in for a decade. But I'm still hurting, and I can't just put it aside becuase he's amorous. And becuase I can't he has ramped up the suicide threats and accusing me of not really caring. So now I'm incredibly exhausted... I just shut down. I don't feel like there is any fight left in me. I can't be stronger than his conditions when he is self-inflicting alcoholism. But if I can't put up a fight to keep him from doing something drastic, then, well, does that mean the worst is inevitable? ",family-friends-of-bipolar
Wait or not to wait - not sure.,"Hi, I just joined this group. My mom was diagnosed with bipolar over 30 years ago when i was a teenager. For the most part, it's been stable although never normal. Few days ago she stopped picking up mine or any phone calls and I live about 2000km from her. I normally speak to her once or twice per week. The last time she disconnected her phone was about 15 years ago, that's when she stopped taking her pills and I had to go there to reason with her to start taking pills and deal with her behaviour where she gave away a lot of her stuff and drag her to her physician. i'm scared that it will be a repeat and not sure if i should jump on a plane to prevent similar situation. I called her landlady who went in to check and said my mom answered the door and looked fine, and said she will call her daughter but she never did. The last time I spoke with my mom was a week and half ago. To me this is unusual. Do I jump on the plane? Do I give it a week? I work full time so debating how best to balance all of this. Welcome any suggestions/thoughts. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
My bipolar suicidal sister,"I can't stand it anymore. She is driving me mad. I have a sister that is bipolar and has depression. She is going through a hard time right now. Don't want to give too many details but she has a full plate. 
Not only is she bipolar and depressed but she is a binge alcoholic and smokes pot all day long. She won't admit she has a problem but she totally does. 
She stayed with me all summer as she was recovering from a back surgery. It was pretty extensive she stayed 6 weeks before and I think 8 weeks after the surgery. Before very thing was fine. She wasn't drinking or even smoking pot since I don't do that. 3 weeks before the surgery she got pot and I could see the change in her. It makes her more depressed. She then had the surgery and it was an awful hospital experience. Everything went to shit after that. 
She has a history of talking about suicide. Once she tried in high school. Other times especially in the past 3 years it's escalated.
Her mania is so hard to deal with. She has almost a paranoia behavior thinking people are talking about her. She always accuses me of not loving her and others not caring about her. High emotional and erratic not rational by any means. 
She calls me today crying hyperventilating and talking about killing herself and wanting to die. Mind you she lives in a different state. And then says never mind you don't have to worry anymore sorry to bother you. Like in did something wrong. I had to call her local police call her best friend get people over there. I call her finally she answers 2 hours later like nothing is wrong like she appreciated the help and didn't give two shots how much she stressed everyone else around her out. 
I'm done. I can't handle this emotional roller coaster ride with her. She is really going through so much right now and I know it's hard but I don't deserve to be shit on. I can't handle her behavior. I want to punch her and scream at her for hurting me. She doesn't care about anyone but herself. Her emotional state is so off. She needs meds but won't take them and chooses to self medicate with alcohol and pot. 
Having a bipolar family member is stressful. My mom was too but passed when in was young. I can't handle this anymore .",family-friends-of-bipolar
my son,"I have posted in the bipolar group about my son. He is 23 years old. When he was 4 he was dignoised as ADHD and was threathen to be kicked out of school if i did not get him meds because he could not sit down to do the work. He was on ADHD meds and everything was back and forth mostly good. When he turned 14 things got trying. He was sucidal  at times. He use to go to church and then he got with a part crowd. When I moved all that seemed to get better. Then he met a girl at 18 moved out and did well for awhile. I bought him a car but he sold it to pay whatever. He had a little girl and at times does well. Then he moved back in wigth me for a little while. Well it has been three years. He has only worked a couple of times out of that time. He does not clean his room unless one of his friends is coming over. He does not do dishes even behind himself. He does not even through wrappers away. I wake to this. I have tried talking to him, Ive tried fussing. Nothing gets to him. My rent man said no smoking in the house or we can get evicted, he still smokes in the house. One time when things came to a head I called mental health and police and told him if he didnt get help then he had to leave. He said you cant kick me out I get mail here ask police officer. The police said he is right you have to go through the courts. I told him if he didnt go to mental health I would go throught the courts. He went one time. I have a 10 year old son also. I have depression and anxiety. I have been on meds for a bit but i just went to counseling. I told my counselor about my son. She said give him a dead line and then he has to go if not you can give him a list of homeless shelters and she said one will help him. I told him everyone has to move by the end of june. He first said thats a lot way away. I said not really when you have no job money or car. Then I told him if he went to homeless shelter that he had to go by the rules. He said he really wasnt listening because he didnt belive that he was going. I said than where you going? His friends wont let him stay but one night because he wont work or clean up behind himself. He said will your my mom your suppose to help me. I said I have been trying to help you for three years. Some days when I think of taking him to shelter I feel relieved because Im tired. I like getting up in the morning and my kitchen not a mess. Plus if I dont buy cigaretts he hits the wall. I want a life of my own. I want him to have his own life. He would make a good salesman. I have bought him clothes for jobs. Then I feel quilty for taking him to shelter not because I dont wont him to grow up but because I am scared that he is going to be sucidial. If he was not bipolar I would been let him try to fend for himself but then again if he wasnt bipolar I may not be in this spot. When he does go to shelter I dont know weather to keeping buy cigaretts and take him places or just cut him off for awhile. I honestly would not mind him living with me if he would abide by the rules respect me but I feel that he never will. Have you ever been this position? Or any advise would be helpful. Thank you",family-friends-of-bipolar
I'm an advocate but still clueless,"Hello,


I have a father with mental illness ( paranoia schizophrenia, biopolar, depression) and I was very young when he was diagnosed . I was too young to understand, was told that my father was getting help for his sadness. Painful and stressful years down the road I had to see/learn about a bit of his mental illness. But I feel like my questions are still not answer. I don't know who to go to or talk to about schizophrenia. This group site seems informative.



So my questions are: 


1) How to talk to someone with the illness? What to say or not to say?


2) Is it a fact that if you bipolar , you could have schizophrenia or delusional thoughts?


3) Need more a personal explanation on living a life with biopolar. 
4) Can I ask someone like my father to explain to me about his struggles? 


5) Will there ever be off switch cure ? 



Let's just say I'm a clueless daughter ! 


Thank u

Not sure what to do next?,"My mother was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder when I was 12, and it slowly destroyed the family I had. My mother was the sweetest person I’ve ever known but when she began to go manic she became someone I’ve never known. I’m now 28 and my mother has had a good couple years after she attempted suicide, but now the nightmare has returned. She is full manic, has been in and out of the hospital 3-4 times in the last month mostly by the police bringing her in, and she now has been kicked out of her apartment. I’ve seen what this did to my family when I was young, and now I’m the only one left of her family that has any ability to help her. I honestly don’t know where to start because I have a full time job, a wife and kid, and don’t have room in my house for her to stay, and even if I did I don’t know if I can risk her destroying my house or the family I have built for myself. It just seems like every time my mom goes manic it’s like a tornado tearing through her life and anyone who is close to her. I thought I might start here to see what other people have done that might point me in the right direction. I’m just lost because I love my mom but it’s also not the mom that raised me.

Disability Civil action question,My son started to apply for disability in 2014 and has been denied 4 different times.  The 3rd time before a judge in June 2017 and the disabilty attorney we used filed an appeal and recently the appeal got denied.  Since then our disabilty attorney has removed himself as the representative and our next course of action is filing a civil action against Social Security or start all over.  There were several mistakes and oversights by both me and the attorney that represented my son.  So it could pay to try the civil action but have no idea where to start.

Traveling With Bipolar and Anxiety,"It’s been a while since I’ve been on here, and there have been some changes. Sadly, not the changes that I had hoped for. My boyfriend Aaron’s moods have gotten worse, they are even more unpredictable and intense. The worst part is that he threatened suicide once when we had gotten into an argument. This happened a few months ago, but it’s not something that I have taken lightly and it seems like I’m constantly monitoring him from day to day. 
On a more recent note, we’re going on a vacation together for two weeks. However, it’s not without great trepidation. Any minor shift in Aaron’s schedule can and will trigger him so issues such as lack of sleep, time changes, and new people have the potential to turn into huge obstacles for him. While he lives by impulse, I am extremely organized and can plan each day accordingly if I have to. The more I can minimize the triggers, the better it will be. 
I, on the other hand, have extreme anxiety when it comes to traveling in general. The anticipation about it alone is enough to send me into a panic attack. The thought of being in a new and strange place, away from home makes me feel insecure, fearful, and apprehensive. The longest “vacation” I have ever been on was for three days, but even so, the nerves were still there, full force. 
Aaron is no help when it comes to being a source of comfort when I’m going through this. Travel is very second nature to him due to his work. Therefore, he doesn’t understand my worries. I express to him that I’m nervous yet still want to go, but he only hears negativity. He says things like, “don’t go,” “I don’t want you to go,” or “I’m going to cancel your plane ticket.” I’ve tried to explain to him that all I need from him is to be there for me and hear me out, 
but to no avail. He lacks empathy and I’m starting to see it more and more. I once had a panic attack while he was present about this whole thing, (which I never do in front of him) and the only thing he could say was, “I don’t need this,” in the most cold tone. 
I have come to the conclusion that simply, traveling makes Aaron’s moods worse! In the days to come, I can only hope and pray that I can keep my anxiety at bay while managing his highs and lows. I’m at the point now where I want to be finished with this vacation and it hasn’t even started.

If anyone has any tips on traveling with either bipolar or anxiety, please let me know.

Bipolar Roommate,"So I've never really done anything like this before but I have a bipolar roommate who I am very concerned about and I thought this website might offer me some help or some insight. 
So just a little bit of explanation, I am currently a junior at my university and I am rooming with three other people in apartment housing that is about five minutes from the campus itself (the housing is funded by the school but it is basically the same as living in a regular apartment).
Two of my roommates (who I'll refer to as D and M) are in relatively good mental health and are getting along very well, myself included. Now the third roomate, who I'll call 'R', is the one who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder about two or so years ago and who has been having a lot of trouble lately. I lived with R and M last year on campus and some of the same issues were present but not to the same degree of severity that they are at now.
About halfway through the school year last year, R was prescribed mood stabilizers and was taking them for a majority of the year until the summer began. The difference was like night and day, R really began to act like herself and told us numerous times show much better she felt and we could see it too and, for the most part, the year ended without incident and we had a lot of great times and I have many fond memories of the three of us together. 
Fastforward to the beginning of this year. R told us that she stopped taking her medication because the school year ended and she didn't have a psychiatrist in her home town. This is an issue we bring up with her because she has insurance, but for some reason she never makes the step to finding one close to her home to continue to take the medication (this kind of apathetic/lazy behavior one of the issues and it is incredibly frustrating to say the least).
Her issues really started to effect us and her about two weeks into the semester. One of these issues is that she needs constant validation and attention, she asked me about 4-5 times a day if I love her and if I am mad at her when I have not done anthing that would warrant her asking me that (i.e. if we got into an argument or disagreement). It feels like she is constantly tip-toeing around all of us when asking for something and it is incredibly hard to talk to her without getting frustrated due to the tone and manner that she speaks (this is hard to explain but it's almost childlike, and sort of like she wants us to feel sorry for her).  
She never cleans up after herself and leaves messes around the apartment for us to clean up constantly, myself, M, and D usually take turns doing the dishes but she has never once cleaned them.
The most concerning thing she does is incredibly self destructive behaviors. She often drinks until she blacks out on the weekends, reacts very strongly to somewhat minor issues and recently (a weekend I was at home) she threatened suicide and M almost calle dthe police. One weekend recently I noticed she had emptied all of her birth control pills into a pile which I thought was incredibly strange and made me very concerned, I don't know what her intentions were but I am keeping a very close eye on her. 
The most concerning behavior, though, is her unrpotected sex. She recently found a boyfriend but had been sleeping with him prior to them maing it official. She told us she took her placebo pills early in order to trigger her period so she could have sex the weekend he came to visit, she then stopped taking them altogether. She tells us that he finishes in her almost every single time they have sex and it is a mircale she's gotten her period last month. 
 About two days ago we came back to school on tuesday due to the Columbus day holiday and she told us he had finished in her twice in the past weekend. Myself, M, and her boyfriend who I'll call 'T' were incredibly concerned and were telling her that she should probably take the plan B pill that prevents pregnancies up to 72 hours after someone has unprotected sex. It took about 30 minutes of convincing her and she tol dus that if she got pregnant she wouldn't have an abortion but refused to go get the pill. She also told us she didn't have the $50 for it and we offered to pay for it and rive her to CVS to get it. She seemed very apathetic and almost uninterested in the whole thing and was even laughing about it. We eventually had to tell her that we were going to buy it for her and that she needed to take it when we got back because she wouldn't be able to afford an abortion and we weren't about to let her ruin her life. She reluctantly agreed so we went to CVS, without her, to buy her Plan B and she thankfully took it when we got back.
She also told us, in a somewhat joking way, that she probably isn't coming back to school next semester because her parents couldn't afford it. She kept telling us she didn't want to leave and we told her that there are so many ways that she could figure this out (talk to the dean, take out a loan, etc.) and she agreed to try and figure it out but based on her previous behaviors that most likely will not happen. She then told us during the whole pregnancy scare situation that she didn't want to come back but myself, D, and M strongly beleive that if she weren't to come back next semester she would just sit around doing nothing and end up hurting herself or doing something that she will regret for the rest of her life.
My roommates talk about this almost everyday and we are really scared for her and what might happen. We love her and want the best for her because she is an incredibly smart, talented, and caring person and we would never want anything bad to happen because of her illness. 
I signed up for the counseling center at my school but they are currently undertaffed so I don't really have a professional tot alk to about this as of right now. Thankfully, she has an appointment with a counselor and a psychiatrist this Friday but all too often she misses the meetings and says something like ""no it's okay I don't need it"" or ""I'll just make another appointment"". 
Myself and M agreed that if this happens come Friday we're going to contact her mom and let her know the severity of the situation. 
I just really need some advice or some help with this because i'm so worried about her and just want her to be happy and to succeed, so anything helps.

Thanks ",family-friends-of-bipolar

dealing with boyfriends depression,"
Hey guys, so my boyfriend has bipolar disorder and some days I really don't know how to take him. I've only ever met one other person with the disorder and she had similar characteristics as he does but she was a lot more out of control with her symptoms. He has his pretty well managed and he takes lithium and takes many steps to help himself. However, he has a few things I just wanted to ask you guys about to see if you go through the same things and what advice you could give me to be more supportive and helpful to him. 
So he is hyper critical of me sometimes. Like, he wants me to give him a lot of details when i'm trying to describe something to him, and he is very blunt when he shares his opinions of me. Like, if he thinks i'm being a dumbass he will call me that or if he thinks I suck at communicating he will say that. He also thinks my critical thinking skills suck and doesn't mind telling me that either. He gets really impatient with me easily and it seems like a switch is flipped when he gets aggravated with me about things and all of a sudden it seems like the end of the world. He will threaten breaking up sometimes. I mean I have my own issues as well! I have a problem with lying and in the past I've had a real problem with being passive aggressive. However, I really take his feelings to heart whenever they happen because they are so dramatic and intense. I think he feels things on a way more intense level than I do and to me it seems like over reactions to little things. 
Also, I have a TERRIBLE time dealing with his depression. It's different than any depressed person I've ever seen. He talks very flat, shows no expressions, and he says he doesn't care to almost anything. I could ask him why he feels a certain way or that I don't like how he's acting and he will just say ""I don't care"". I don't handle his depression very well at all and I want to get better at it. The way I handle it usually is I just stay quiet and don't bring it up much, I just feel like there's really nothing I can do to make him feel any better so no point in trying, I should just let him get over it on his own. That comes across as cold to him though, and I can understand that. I don't want to be that way. I want to be helpful and full of conversation, but it's just not him and I have a hard time being myself around him when he's that way. I like it when he's happy and talkative. Sometimes I tell him I don't want to deal with his depression and that hurts his feelings a lot and I feel terrible for getting to that point. Especially since I have generalized anxiety disorder and he has to deal with that. 
Please give me advice on how to deal with the depression and the aggravation and impatience. I don't want to be this unhelpful, confused, girlfriend who acts uncaring and just lost with how to communicate with him.

Mother with undiagnosed bipolar,"Hi.
I am 47.  I had a tough childhood living with a mother whose mood was unpredictable.   My dad was a weak man who was using me and my sister's to keep the family together.  He was affectionate and depressed most of his life.  He was not able to protect us from my mom when she was in a rage.  My sister and I was spanked daily since we were 5 or6 for not doing the chores.  She always yelled at me for not being able to clean the house properly when I was 6 years old.  I remember she never taught me how to do that.  
My mom has loud laugher and angry outbursts.  She hates my dad and had tried to leave him many times.  I have sympathy for my dad however.  She never like to work or was ever hold down a job for too long.  She actually left my dad and sister's to  go to a trade school but ended up never worked.  She always wanted to find a way to go on welfare so she could move us into government housing.  Luckily that never happened because her rich brother helped us to buy a house.  My dad had odd jobs and finally retired after we finish university.  My sister got a job and was paying for the mortgage.  My mom was book smart but always bossy and critical of other.  She bosses everybody around.
 I would have never realized that she may have bipolar until I have this trouble maker coworker whose is creating havoc for everyone at work but is supported by management.  I realized that she may be accommodated for a mental illness.  I read up on mental illness at work and learned that bipolar coworkers are the worst coworker because of their unpredictability and mood swings.  I also realized that she is so much like my mom.  At this point in my life, I have distanced myself from my mother.  She has crawled back living with my dad since now he has retired and had some benefits after having moved away to another country and living by herself for 10 years.  She continues to abuse him but he has a dependent personality so would never fought back.  I  have been able to set some limits with her I realized that even in our good interactions, she could be toxic.  I have taught her that after a toxic conversation I stop talking to her for a while, and the next time she behaves better.  She knows what she is doing.  She hated me for setting limit with her but now that she needs me.  She can be so decorative and dramatic in her words but I hate that so much because I could see through it.
I am sick and tired of the facts that my management is not doing anything about this sick coworker and letting her bully people.  I also wonder if this is an opportunity for me to gain insight about my family.  I am looking to heal.  I would appreciate any information about good therapy and support for people like me.  Thank you for reading.

Introduction And Our Backstories,"Introduction
Hey everyone, I’m brand new to this and also the first time I have spoken about this on a platform such as this.
My Backstory (if you want to read)
My name is Alida and I’m 21 years old. Currently, I am a nursing student in college living with my dad. I have been in a relationship for 8 years with my boyfriend, Aaron, 25. About 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and panic disorder. It wasn’t a surprise, as I had known something was wrong when I was about 7 years old. Day to day life can be tough, but with my medication, and excellent support system in my father and Aaron, it’s a little less of a struggle. 
Intro Continued
However, in January of 2017, I noticed a stark shift in Aaron’s mood. I blew it off thinking it was due to his new job causing him more stress than usual. (I won’t post his job title for privacy reasons). He previously had issues with stress, but nothing more than he couldn’t handle. This was different. The first thing I noticed were the mood swings. He would cycle rapidly, from irritability and frustration, to elation and talkativeness. As the months progressed, he became worse: lacking patience (something he always had with me), becoming more irrational and impulsive. For example, with gambling. He spends huge sums of money at a time and does not stop to think about the consequences. Once, he won more money than he came with and decided to go out on a shopping spree resulting in a new laptop of which neither of us needed. If he loses his money while gambling, I am the first one he blames and takes his aggression out on. 
Aaron’s moods are unpredictable and all over the place, never knowing what he is going to be like or say from day to day. About 6 months ago, I tried to bring his mood swings to his attention, but that only made him angry and argumentative. He didn’t want to hear what I had to say and began to attack me on a personal level. Needless to say, I haven’t tried to talk to him about it again. The only person I have confided in about Aaron is my dad, and I know he is getting sick of hearing about all of his antics. 
I have tried getting myself and eventually Aaron into counseling but being a broke college student really doesn’t work in my favor. 
Aaron’s Backstory
Aaron is 25 years old with a demanding but great paying job. We have been together for 8 years going on 9. He is a wonderful man who loves me and has immense talent with limitless potential. He lives at home with his parents and 2 younger siblings. For the past two years, we have discussed moving in together, but for now I have too much apprehension surrounding his extreme mood swings. On the other hand, I know living with me would be better for him. His home life is volatile (domestic abuse and alcoholism). His parents constantly fight, and being the oldest child, he is put in the middle of it all, and forced to protect his younger siblings. He refuses to talk about it, but I know he has seen and heard some things in his life that have been emotionally damaging. In addition, the relationship he has with his father is almost nonexistent. This has taken a toll on him and now I believe it’s all starting to come out.
NOTE: Aaron has not been clinically diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After observing and being on the receiving end of his behavior for over a year, bipolar disorder is a suggestion that I have considered. He exhibits almost all of the signs, but I’m still researching and impartial to other reasons.

So frustrated,"My husband has been so emotionally distant for the past few months. Has been breaking plans at the last minute, without letting me know. We do not live together. He will be fantastic one day and nothing the next.  He broke plans again last week and was supposed to come over by train so we could go on vacation and take our kids to his dads for a week.  He quit his job the week before after missing 3 days in less than 2 weeks. He keeps telling me we have had conversations about things we did not, or only part of.  I told him I was sick of him doing this and that I was done for awhile. Well he hung up on me.  I tried to call him later to explain and hope he calmed down. Would not answer the phone but sent me a million text about how he is sick of MY crap and should have been done with me along time ago. Then what a bad mom I am and he cant believe he let me raise our kids! AND he is scared of what I may be teaching them!  What a bunch of garbage!  Then he waited 5 days and deleted and blocked me on fb!  And he had court for child support last Fridat, not just regular, in front of the judge for contempt, AND he didnt go!  They ordered him to sit 60 days!  
I know he has been manic lately, but he just is making things terrible for himself.  I know he does not mean the things he said to me, but it still hurts.  Very hard to watch him self destruct.",family-friends-of-bipolar
Blood moon and lunar eclipse,"I can fully affirm that the lunar changes affect my husband. He has been irritable, mean, and manic.

Journeying with Bipolar Disorder,"Today, my brother was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
It was a watershed moment - a huge relief to know that he had not been diagnosed with a more debilitating illness. But deeply painful all the same. 
Bipolar is like a monster I fear but cannot bring myself to understand. So many questions abound. What does it mean to be bi-polar? How do individuals with bi-polar disorder feel on a daily basis? What can be done for them? Is there a cure? What are the roots of this illness? Does it go beyond the physical, emotional and intellectual into the spiritual? How can someone with bipolar disorder live a happy, fulfilling life? What is a happy, fulfilling life? 
The journey has just begun. ",family-friends-of-bipolar
"Better Day Today, I Hope....","Well, had the visit for the kids.  Day 1, went to an amusment park.  I get child support from him sparatically, he is currently going to court for not contempt.  Not paying and not showing up.  Anyhow, he paid for everything so that was good.  I basically ignored him the whole time and just interacted with the kids.  Was not a bad day.
2 hours after we get dropped off, I get a text that he is staying at a hotel near by and wanted to know if I wanted to ""hang out"".  I had very mixed feelings about this.  1- He has ignored me for 3 weeks with the exception of the stupid song messages, 2- I needed to talk to him without the kids because I was going to tell him I was filing for divorce, 3- I kind of wanted an explination of WHY he just stopped talking to me, but then I really did not want one because then I always know it is due to the BP which he does nothing about.  Anyhow, I ended up going.
So I had mentioned in an earlier post that he had been getting upset with me for things that were not really my fault.  The kids and I went on a trip to Florida to visit my dad, and had made plans for this back in Feb or March, well, turned out I flew home on Fathers day, the kids stayed another 2 weeks.  So while I am waiting to fly out, he calls me and tells me I will probably need to uber to his place from the airport because he had been drinking already (he had my car for the week I was gone and was going to pick me up at the airport), and there was money in my glove box and keys in his mailbox.  It was 1pm when he is telling me this.  Whatever, fast forward, I did that, he was still up so I went into his apartment, and he starts telling me how he is really upset that I planned this trip for them to not be there on Fathers day.  WTH!  I told him that he knew about this for months and just because he realized it now is not a reason to be upset at me.  And he has been working 6 days a week, so I asked if the kids would have been there would he really have taken off on Saturday to come and spend Fathers Day weekend with the kids, probably not.  He agreed but said that he still felt that way.  Then apparently he had an accident where he was riding his bike and someone opened a car door.  Hit the door going pretty fast, hurt his hip, shoulder, knee, broke his phone, and had to be off of work for 10 days.  So that put him into kind of a funk.  That he said he did not tell me because he knew that I would want to come and try to help him and he was depressed and so there is 10 days of  the 3 weeks.  Then as I already know, he feels bad that he has done these things and bla, bla, bla.
I had needed to talk to him to let him know I was filing for divorce.  I would do legal separation, but again due to his unmanaged bp, he does not handle his emotions the best and it affects me alot and our relationship.  As soon as I said divorce, he told me he thought he was going to be sick and asked me to leave.  I said I was not and we were talking things through.  So after it is all said and done, he said he will go see someone because he does not want to get a divorce.  I am still filing for separation as there are things I need to do that we can not  be married living separate.  But I feel somewhat hopeful.  He has concerns with me too, so even though I deal with his bp, I told him I would check into seeing someone about my anxiety issues from dealing with him and his issues for so long.  So we seem to be putting things back in the right direction.  Hopefully...
",family-friends-of-bipolar
Ugh,"Well. I got a text from him a few days ago saying he would be at my house tomorrow morning. First I've heard from him in 3 weeks. This is his court appointed weekend to visit the kids. And he has supervised visitation, by me so I have to go from 9 to 5.  Still won't answer if I call. I called yesterday and left a msg saying if he can't even be adult enough to call and discuss what his plans are then dont show up. Got a text today saying ""plan on bla bla"".  Not really a discussion. Not even a conversation. And was more him telling than anything else. UGH!!
And I talked to my sister in law earlier this week. Dropped the B (bi polar) word and of course now no one will talk to me on his side of the family.  She wont even look at my messages I send her now. Sent her hub a msg yesterday saying so and that I messed up with my panic attack with her but they were supposed to be supporting me and my kids with this stuff and they failed with that. I am done. My kids see it, I see it, and they only choose to see it when it involves them. He had a week this winter where he would not answer their calls and they were throwing rocks at his window(which got no response) and they were worried. Duh! But this doesn't affect them so it is just me being crazy or something.
And I was on the phone with his dad yesterday because my kids and I are camping near him next month and my hub called. Said he would call me back after and I hear nothing since. Soooooo I am assuming that is done too.

How do I find the truth between psychosis and lies,"I haven't been on here, well because it was always the SSDD, and after 15 years with my husband, this is just about as bad as it's ever been.  Finding women's names and numbers in his phone, sexual texts from 1 woman to him (which supposedly she meant to send to her husband Jeremy and accidently sent them to my husband Jerry), taking my ATM card and spending hundreds of dollars a day, taking off in the middle of the night, not sleeping for a week at a time, daily rages (throwing things, breaking things, holes in doors from him punching and kicking them), screaming and cussing me out every other day for hours at a time, continuously accusing me of cheating with people I haven't seen in years, he's smoking pot and taking meds that expired 4 years ago.  This has been going on for the past 2 months, non-stop.  In between all of this were moments when he would apologize profusely, saying he's just stressed and frustrated, and professes his undying love and faithfulness to me.  Then says he's not leaving til he's done bleeding me dry.  I just don't know where the truth lies in all of this mess.  Has my entire 15 years with this man been a giant con?  Or is he really that psychotic off his meds?  He has left me, and has a psychiatrist appointment on the 16th that I fear he won't go to.  I just keep crying because he says the most horrible things to me, then in the blink of an eye, he acts like everything is fine and he didn't say anything.  Tells me I need to quit hanging on to things, he says that stuff since he's crazy.  He has screamed in my face that he hates me and hoped I died on the operating table the day before I was having surgery.  The people he was living with while we were separated got a 3 year restraining order on him for assault but didn't press charges, so clearly this madness is not only directed at me.  I just feel completely lost and confused.  I needed his help when I broke my arm and needed surgery, so I really didn't have much choice but to ask him to come home and help me.  But this has been 2 months of torture for me and I just keep crying because it's too much.  
For those who have read this far and don't know me from way back when, my husband was a wonderful man when we married.  He coached the kids' soccer and baseball teams, never missed a game for his own kids or mine.  He would drop everything to help me, family members, friends and strangers.  His best friend was a homeless man that we helped, even the kids gave up receiving expensive gifts one Christmas so we could help furnish his apartment.  Sadly, his friend passed away, later that year his dad passed away, and the following year he lost his mother.  After all that loss, I lost my husband to insanity and will see glimpses of him now and then, but not for any significant length of time.  He ended up 5150'd after his dad's death, and ended up arrested and in prison after his mother's passing.  All of which he blames me, not his threats of suicide and to harm others.  He did have a good year after his release, in a sober living, regular therapy and stable on his meds.  Anyway, I'm just feeling heartbroken, sad, confused, and don't know which way is up at this point.  I've been praying, going to church, and trying to just let go and let God through my tears.  I know the right thing to do will be revealed, and I just really hope and pray he can find his way, with or without me.  Oh, and a big part of why I haven't divorced him was to keep him on my insurance.  He has needed multiple surgeries, and I wanted him to be covered any time he did want to see a therapist or psychiatrist. And yes, I still love him, despite how awful he is to me.

Long illness/New diagnosis,"Im new to this site, I really need advise....My husband and I have been married 22 years, we have two kids they are 20 and 18, both live at home. My husband turned 50 this year and has been a very active member of AA for almost 12 years. He had cancer in 2002 and was put on paroxatine for the side effects of chemo. He remained on it up until may this year. I noticed symptoms for years but they never escalated to the point they are at now. I brought him into a crisis center on Friday June 29 ( he only agreed because 1. it was voluntary and 2. they were going to tell me i was ""crazy"" not him) He was diagnosed with bipolar and in a manic episode...He refused to stay. The following three days he became aggresive and although he never put his hands on me he destroyed property in our home and threw things at me. By monday night i had enough and with my 18 year old daughters encouragement i called the police. The police could not remove him from the home because the last four hours of verbal abuse and threats he did not assault me. the incidents of property damage happened the previouse days and he was locked in his room when police arrived. They told me they would talk to him and let me collect some clothes so i could leave. When they knocked on the door he refused to come out. Upon questioning he insinuated he had weapons in the room with him. The police took him out of the house because of the threat of weapons. He is blaming me for the 3 day hold he is taking meds but wants a divorce. 
Here is my question .. How long do i wait to start divorce papers I have stuck through years of his behaviors knowing he was ill and trying to get him help now im scared of his reaction. and m not sure if he really wants to divorce.
We own a business together and i cant run it without him he could hire an office manager to replace me so that leaves me with no income and a lot of debt
Basicly I know that symptoms have been masked for years,he now has meds and after all i have put up with do i wait for meds to work before i get legal help or do i start now to protect myself?",family-friends-of-bipolar
here we go again...,"Hello, it has been awhile since I have posted here.  So I have been ""dating"" my husband for about 8 months again now.  We have been separated for almost 3 years now.  Things were going really well actually, he is not on meds (self medicates), but has finally got his own apartment, working, and had been pretty responsible.  He also was calling and texting daily and making alot of effort to ensure our relationship was doing well.  He had even gone as far as to suggest we work towards living together again but did not want to do it immediately because he wanted to get his bills situated, get a car, and make sure he had a job lined up.  That was great because he would always before just want to move back in.  I thought that was a very big step forward on his part.  Also, we have discussed how he does not want to be on medications, which I think could be doable as long as he is seeing a therapist or phych so he has a plan when things are not going well with his moods.
About a month ago he got a new job with very long hours 6 days a week.  I told him to be careful because he tends to burn himself out mentally and physically, then things usually start to go downhill.  So after about a week or 2 with the new job, there would be days where I would not hear from him.  Then the hours of the job started affecting the amount of time we were spending together.  We have 2 kids that live with me and that was affecting the amount of time he spent with them also.  Then there were things that he was doing like getting mad at me for things that were not my fault and using that excuse for why he was not calling or coming over.  Lots of little things like that were happening more and more.  And I started to notice the withdrawing and non interest in things.  I also discovered he had lied to me about very stupid small things which he has not done in a very long time.  Finally, about 2 weeks ago, we had made plans for him to come over.  I got a text saying he would get ahold of me on his way home from work, and that was it.....
I have re-established a relationship with my sister in law, which I have not had for many years.  He would go to her house when he was not in a good place mentally.  He would lie to her and tell her we were fighting and not to answer the phone if I would call or things like that.  And no one wanted to actually believe that he was bipolar because as we all know they are very good at hiding it.  In the end I would argue with her to the point that we did not talk for many years.  That being said, after not hearing  from him for about a week, I had been talking to her on and off about up coming plans to get together and the things going on with him.  Then she told me she had to get off the phone because he was there and getting ready to leave.  After we hung up I had a total panic attack.  All the things in my head about how 8 months of good stuff going out the window and then with the ""how long is this going to go on now"".  Needless to say I tried to call her back during my panic and then I get no answer.  Soooo that made it worse and my head goes back to all the times I felt like they were conspiring against me and I was the crazy one.  I know this is not what was going on, but if anyone has had a panic attack, you know you can not talk yourself out of what your thinking at that point in time.  I kept trying to call her back to talk, and mainly needed someone to talk me down a little, and then was texting her things that I was meaning more about him, but she did not take them that way.  So basically now we are not talking again which is devastating to me.  
As far as him, aside from the withdrawing, he has gotten upset with me for various things that were unnecessary, stopped talking to me (aside from sending me a utube video text last week of a song about missing and loving someone ), has not contacted either one of the kids (our youngest text him on fathers day) and the last time he saw them he drove us to the airport for a vacation on June 10, and planning to come over and nothing since.  I know it is not us or me, and that this is all him and his bipolar but it is driving me nuts.  Part of me is like whatever, then the other part of me wants to call him and let him know that things are ok and I understand (as much as I can) what is going on and I support him.  Then there is the chance I could call and he could tell me that he is just not happy and its done.  Always up in the air with them.  Or maybe he is not contacting because he knows how much he upset me and does not want to deal with the situation. I am just unsure on what to do.  I am having a really hard time because of just how well thing had been progressing a few weeks ago.

Concerned,"Hey Guys and Gals and Everyone Else,
My wife and I lost our son earlier this year when he was stillborn. She grieved, but mostly in her own mind (I hope you understand what I mean). She never talks about it, she didn't really cry that I saw. She seemed OK. But then our cat died a few days ago. She is inconsolable. She can't stop crying and she seems truly grief stricken. She has bipolar, which I don't always understand. Why is she losing it about the cat, when she seemed to make it through before? Sorry if I sound like I don't care, this isn't something I really understand. But I want to know how best to help her and be there for her.",family-friends-of-bipolar
Mom not yet diagnosed bipolar,"I have just recently figured out my mom is bi-polar but has not been diagnosed.  We have gone to counseling a few times and both of them have said they thought she was.  I’m 34 and was raised by her and it like everything makes sense now.  She has been homeless and pretty much lossed everything, she is at rock bottom but still no change.  I’m scared to bring up the subject of maybe medicine or seeing a doctor because she will flip out.  Today I mentioned maybe going to another counselor and she said they were a waste of money and she wasn’t the only one with problems.  I’m just trying to figure out how to live with it.  I’ve done it my whole life, I’m an only child.  But my anxiety level is higher and its exhausting dealing with it at times because I’m literally her only family member left as she doesn’t speak To anyone else.",family-friends-of-bipolar
His life had barely started...,"My son is in jail. He will most likely be there until Christmas if we're lucky. Maybe more. Hopefully , he'll be sent to some intensive inpatient hospital for a month and then maybe 5 months in a rehab like place. All this of course is the best scenario. He could get more time.
Bi-polar disorder: our lack of education on the subject; not taking his meds; no psychological support; paranoid episods. That's why in the end he is in jail. 
The hardest part, as his mother, is when I have to admit to myself that I am scared of him coming home in a year or more. I am afraid for his futur: his, ours.. how will I keep him safe? How will I trust him again to take care of himself? He is just 21. Is this the rest of his life?

I feel like I am losing my mom,"Hi, I have never done anything like this but i was told it could help.... I am 20 year old girl and I have known my mom has had bipolar since i was 10. I didn't know exactly what it was at the time but I just said okay and went along with it. I never understood why my mom would randomly go on 20 mile runs or spend $2000 in a day. I just thought this was normal for people to do sometimes. I never noticed any of the bad things since I started getting older. When my mom is manic she has stages. First stage is she's talking a million miles a minute and she makes up a bunch of lies that don't make sense. Then after this she gets super happy and she feels on top of the world, if we even mention the word manic she tells us to shut up. When she gets in this state she always has one night where she goes out drinking, completely blacks out, and says crazy things to people and can barely stand up. Sometimes when she would come home she would just tackle me and my brother and hit us thinking it was funny but it actually hurt. Then after this comes depression, and I mean depression hard. She doesn't get out of bed. She tries to feel bad about herself and tells me and my dad and brother that we all just need to leave her. After this comes anger. This is the worst part. I don't know when she is gunna blow. Anything can light her fuse. I have to tiptoe around her the entire time. Then eventually she goes back to herself.

Lately though she hasn't been herself at all. It's been 2 moths of her just being a completely different person that I grew up with. My mom was my best friend, I could talk to her about anything and she would have the perfect advice for me. But now I can't even talk to her. She checked her self into a mental institution about a month ago. I thought this was good and she eventually would be back to herself. She had just been really mean for a couple months and it was really affecting my family. She was breaking plates and throwing things across rooms and just screaming at us for no reason. She was put on new medications and after that she was doing okay for a couple days. Then the absolute worse scenario that could of happened happened. My mom got dress syndrome which is a 1 in 10,000 chance of taking this medicine. She almost died from this and was in the hospital for 5 days. I was so scared it was insane. After she got out of the hospital I thought she would just get better and she would get back to normal. But, she was put on the same meds and she had in the first place and she is even more mean now. I can't talk to her about anything without her making me feel like a shitty person. She actually insulted my boyfriend while he was sitting next to me and i didn't say anything because I didn't want to get her more mad than she already was (she was already yelling at me for something completely insane that didn't make sense). When I talked to her the next day about how that made my boyfriend uncomfortable that she said those things. She screamed at me and said it was my fault that I didn't say anything and that she had no fault in this situation cause I said nothing. She was literally blaming me for something she said. I just can't talk her and that really really hurts. Every time anything happens i just want to talk to her, but I cant. I just don't know how to deal with this.

Venting,"My dad is Bipolar, diagnosed about eight years ago, and is starting to get much worse. He is medicated, but does not go to therapy, and came from quite a rough childhood. I think his meds are not doing the job, but I really don't want to get involved, as I was the one who got him diagnosed, and that was a challenge in its self.
I'm getting quite frustrated with his behavior, especially with his gambling and telling me I should be supporting him. He has been earning a six-figure income for his long career of 40+ years and should have retired a long time ago. 
I am just now gotten a somewhat decent temporary job, but it is in my crappy town and looking to use this money to move away permanently from this situation.
He is also recently divorced, as of last year, and keeps trying to pull me into his crap. He has no social life or hobbies, unless you count TV...  
I don't really want to cut ties, but it is definitely getting tiring listening to his problems and drama.
He is the last of the family I have left due to having a mentally ill mother and her family being quite toxic too. 
I can't move away from this situation until at least August, when this work, hopefully, finishes and I can move on.
Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far.

I just want him to be happy.,"Hello. My brother was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder with mixed features several years ago; as well as Schizoaffective Disorder. He also has crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, barrett's esophagus, gambling addiction, crystal meth addiction and a large trauma history. He has been in and out of psychosis many times in the past 15 years and it is so scary. Today he left for a treatment center in our area for a 9 month residential stay for his addictions! This brings so much joy to my heart. I just love him so much and want him to be happy. I joined this group because of a class I am in at school. I chose this group specifically because of the pain I feel for my brother.

Irritated and no end in sight,"Warning: I'm venting.
My husband is bipolar. He has so much going on that I don't know where to begin  but here is a rundown: Unemployed for the past couple of years because he is a felon and RSO from two decades ago, awful spending habits, unable to wait until any money comes in to him and wants a loan instead for instant cash, lowest impulses I have ever seen, learning disorder so cannot figure out things that are obvious to others, quick temper that is disproportionate to what is going on, unthankful, much more loyal to others (except with money which he doesn't like to repay) than he is to me despite the fact that I do everything for him, inconsiderate,  selfish, and highly critical of others despite the fact that he has the lion's share of issues. And all of this is at a high right now because he is unmedicated and waiting for his medications to be cleared by insurance. 'Then why'd you pick him?' you ask. Because I was desperate to be married and the guy I really wanted wasn't interested and then he came along. Pathetic, I know. And now I realize that singleness is great - not dating around, true singleness. This is just not what I thought my life would look like. Now, the only hope I have is to get through this marriage with my sanity in tact.

So tired of the constant blame,"I will just apologize in advance for the venting and very long post.
I just can't get more than 1-2 good weeks with my husband before that switch flips in his brain and he hates me, everything negative that has ever happened in his life is all my fault, and he never wants to speak to me again (except to send dozens of texts cussing me out).  I don't even get to enjoy the few weeks of stability and kindness, because the hateful words that follow just overpower the good. I received my diploma in the mail today, and all my family amd friends are congratulating me. But I didn't even get a chance to be happy or excited or even proud of myself because I have to be reminded how I abandoned my marriage to work nights and go to school and he's just been sitting and waiting for 4 years for me to finish. (A little back story for those who don't know me . . . My husband threatened suicide in 2013, instead of being 5150'd, he ended up arrested and convicted of felony threats - yes, against me . . . Thus how everything is my fault). Sooooooo, we have been separated most of the time since then, but always working towards living together again.  He just told me last week he's been out of his medication for 2 weeks, and it will take a few more before they are delivered. So this is never completely unexpected.

Too Early for This,"I have just been through a stressful weekend and am already in for a stressful week. It is barely 8am.
I am a trainer and content developer in healthcare. I have very demanding needs, and I am also trying to work towards a degree. I've built a training program from scratch, and while it isn't perfect, its been workable. I have to build a training schedule for staff while accommodating clients, and also while building content, and it's stressful, but I am proud of the efforts I make.
I just wrapped up a week of training, thinking that people are getting into things, and getting acquainted. I encourage them to take their time, and I am touching base individually with all of them to answer their questions.
I was looking forward to starting this week, and now I get an email from their manager (whos still in training) saying they are struggling with the pace of training. Truthfully, I cannot slow down much more. It entails finding something to fill their time. If they have nothing to do, I am at fault. So as I hear this, I am completely crushed, discouraged, and lost what confidence I have built to prepare today.
There is just always something, and I don't know what to do. I feel like each week I get gut punched and have to pick myself up, and as soon as I do, I get kicked down again. It's hard...it is hard, and it is exhausting, and the stress I think is making me crack. I want to take the day off but I just don't feel that I can. It just really sucks to work this hard only to be told it isn't enough. No one knows what it takes, and what it does to me. 
I know that throughout the day, I'll feel better, perhaps realize I am overreacting mentally and physically, but all that I have said above is still true, and will resurface.

I recently made the decision to leave my job after over 8 years. They are trying to make me travel to train I don't want to train anymore. I've basically done three jobs, been a yes person forever, and yet, they walk all over me and sparingly tell me they appreciate me but pile on more. I can't take the stress anymore. The anxiety I work through- but I find myself having panic attacks still, and I just decided it isn't worth it.
I have a full-on plan, have been looking for work daily and applying. And yes, I know I know- the virus makes it difficult, but I have no doubt I'll find something. 
But as I try to do what needs to be done- I have no motivation to continue working. If I didn't need the $, I'd quit on the spot. But while I know I can handle these things that come across my lap until I find something, I am struggling to find the motivation to do so and have no energy, no matter what I do.

How to help a partner with stress,"Hello.  Im new to this group and Im in need of advice regarding stress and my partner.  I myself deal with a large amount of stress a day.  It could be my kids acting up, worried about money, having an argument with someone, having to manage a large family on my own and the daily stress that comes with it.  I believe this to be normal, everyday stress that is pretty much unavoidable and something we all have to learn to deal with.  My partner has a very hard time dealing with this kind of stress or anykind really.  It could be work, his home eniviroment (we don't live together), an issue with a friend or with family, someone making a lot of noise at home, not getting enough sleep, not having enough money, having to do a chore, something breaking or not working right, etc.  It breaks him down and he gets very angry and aggitated and starts to put blame towards others for his stress.  I want to help him but its very difficult and also hard to be around.  If I have a problem, my partner is the first person I want to share it with but in reality he is the last person I can share it with.  If he can't handle his stress, dealing with mine is a nightmare and a huge inconvenience for him.  So its affecting our relationship as well.  What can I do to help him?  I feel like Im encouraging and understanding and very patient with him but that hasn't seemed to help.  I was thinking it could possibly be depression as well since he is always unhappy no matter what happens in his life.  I just want him to find happiness and peace in his life.  ",stress-management
Struggling with creating new stress,"I work full time and have started school full time.

Overall I manage my schedules pretty well. I work earlier hours to attend to my schoolwork sooner, and dedicate my weekends to do it.
Sometimes as I do my school work, I do get annoyed and just want to relax. But when I finish an assignment, I find the satisfaction of completing something makes me overeager to just jump ahead and dive into a new one. Generally, the excitement sets me over the edge and I end up doing more than what is necessary. Then I am exhausted.
So in this moment I have completed my lessons for the week, and I can just have a leisurely Sunday afternoon. But because of the habits I have built, as I relax, I feel a sense of guilt. Then I become stressed.

Lacking Motivation,"I am so over this Coronavirus. While it has not changed my life that much compared to what it has in others the whole thing puts a big gloom over everything.

Stressing About Coronavirus,"This coronavirus scare has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety - as I'm sure it has for many others.  It isn't so much the virus I'm stressed about.  It's the economic impact.  I work in the hospitality industry.  Many people in our industry are being laid off while restaurants and bars are shut down and travel is restricted.  I haven't been laid off yet, but I feel it is just a matter of time.
I have a habit of catastrophizing everything.  I worry about what would happen if I were laid off.  How long could we survive on our meager savings and government benefits?  Would I be able to find other work?
Even worse, I worry about what it says about me.  I realize that it doesn't really say anything.  I didn't do anything to cause the situation - and neither did my company or our industry.  Still, there is a voice in my head that says I'm failing my family.  I hear my parents voices in my head saying that people on unemployment are taking advantage of the system.  I know this isn't true even in the best of times - and that this is a unique situation - but it is hard for me to unwire what I learned in my youth.",stress-management
Hi I am new here,Hi all I am new here I have fought with anxiety mainly health anxiety and ocd for decades.

Worked Up,"I find that I get in a bad mood and little things pile up. When something is due or something is not working out I sometimes let it build until it completely explodes. I have never found a good coping technique that would work for me. The suggestions that I have heard from friends or classmates such as listen to music, draw or go for a run sounds completely ridiculous to me because in the moment I want to focus on solving the problem that is stressing me out and not waste time on these activities which I cant focus on anyway because I am still stressed about whatever has me upset. I have found absolutely no positive ways of coping besides just solving the problem. This means when a problem cannot be easily or quickly solved my bad mood could last for days or how ever long it takes to resolve it. Is there any coping strategies that could actually work for me and aren't those generic responses of mediating or cooking or whatever most people do to relax because when I am stressed doing any of those activites sounds like absolute hell. Am I alone in this? Everyone seems to have an avtivity that they can do to calm down but none of those things solve my problem so I feel unproductive while doing them and often makes my mood worse as I feel I wasted time that I could have spent fixing things or completing assignments. ",stress-management
Two Weeks of True Adulthood,"These past two weeks have indeed been overwhelming for me and given me a wakeup call as to what it truly means to be an adult and take responsibility for many things. Long story short, I recently retired (medically) from the Air Force, due to a diagnosis of RRMS. I got another job while on active duty and I start Monday the 9th (March, of course). These past two weeks were a huge whirlwind for me. I had to reapply for TriCare Prime for Retirees, had an EMG/Nerve Study, new patient appointment with the VA, phone calls with the VA on benefits and healthcare, reregister my car in the state of Utah, had to get a new driver's license for Utah, had to nag my mom to get me my original copies of important documents, had to go back to the license bureau (a separate building from the DMV, really weird) and take a 25 question test, got my license, had to get an oil change, had to reapply for a new passport, sign documents for my new job on base, and now waiting anxiously for my car title and driver's license to come back to me. Whew, lot of my chest! Needless to say, these two weeks tested my patience and stress levels, which were at an all time high! I admit I had to let out my emotions and cry a few times to release the tensions and negativity I had. When I got done with my crying episode, I felt a bit better, but knew I had to do more to reduce my stress and anxiety. such as incorporate yoga and meditation daily to ground myself. Do you cry just to let go and release the negativity/emotions you truly feel when everything piles on you? What are some other ways you reduce stress and keep your cool? ",stress-management

New Here - Daily stress issue,"Hello. I figured it would be good to reach out to talk with anyone, even if it ends up just being a sounding board in the end.
I suffer from a lot of stress that has been coming up a lot lately. It has been dealing a lot lately from manifesting the stress in my issues of abandonment. I recently realized that I get overly stressed about it when I talk with my mom, or when she would usually visit, until I moved out of state. As a child my parents had divorced, and the original plan was to spend the summer with my dad who had moved back to Kentucky. When it was close to the end of summer, my dad had told me my mom was going to be moving to Georgia, and that I had to make a decision to stay with him, or move to Ga with my mom. I chose the former before being able to talk with my mom about it, who had later told me she had no plans to move there. When addressing it to my dad, he said I had to keep my decision, despite me not wanting to stay in Ky. Time came for my mom to pick up my oldest brother who had decided to stay with my mom, regardless of where she was, I was not allowed to go. This pretty much began the start of that abandonment fear, as it seemed like my mom did not even try to take me along. 3 years pass, with an all but absent dad, who barely took care of me, I finally decided I was not going to take the flight home back to Ky when I went to visit my mom and brother for his graduation. After all of that, I have always felt like I was not really accepted in a way. It always felt like the attention was on either of my brothers and I was set as an afterthought. Here I am, nearly 23 years after deciding to stay with my mom, it always feels like I am an afterthought. The only ones who really remember anything about my life tends to be my wife and children. I have secluded myself from really having any friends, just so I do not have to feel abandoned by more people, and it has started to take its toll on me.",stress-management

Peak Performance Training for Mental Fitness,"Hi friends,My brother is a football player. He was an average performing sportsperson at the initial stages of his career. He aimed to become a great player who outshines the average. But he was not able to concentrate and focus during training because of the stress coming at the time of the football matches. He wanted to overcome this weakness that stands as an obstacle in achieving his dreams. A player should have both physical and mental strength to succeed in the career. For that effective emotional preparation is required. For that, he approached peak performance training services near his training ground. It helped him to gain mental fitness that is required importantly. There is a great improvement in his performance that made his trainers to appreciate him.

new here,"Hi everyone, 
I'm new here and not sure how or where to begin. I'm not sure if I'm stressed out or depressed. I'm struggling in my life and feel like I want to scream. My husband is not living at home for the next 2 years due to his job we see him on most weekends but I hate him for this. I'm overwhelmed with work and kids. When My husband and I got married I was going to be a homemaker, that was my dream but, because of some really stupid decisions, on his part, I had to go back to work full time and become the breadwinner of the family.  My husband got a job during the summer which has taken him away but does not pay nearly enough for us to survive without my income.  
There is no one I can talk to because everyone on my side of the family is to concerned about their lives to remotely listen or care about me (which I get and that’s how it should be but sometimes it hurts). I can't talk to anyone on my husbands side because he's oh so wonderful and because when compared to my husbands family we are the cousin eddies from national lampoon and they don't want to know how hard we struggle (his entire family and I mean everyone aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, parents are all well off living in their $500,000+ homes, wearing their perfect clothes, and going on their extravagant vacations). Every time somethings brought up they laugh it off like I'm exaggerating and I'm tired of it. 
I can't handle the pressure, am burnt out, my kids are driving me nuts and my house is a complete and utter disaster.  I know I should be grateful for all I have, especially with everything happening in this world, and I would love to be but I just want to pull my hair out and scream. I want to quit my job and run away. I have no way to relax, am constantly on edge, and have no patients. I’m a complete and utter mess.

I may be stressed physically but not sure.,"Hello,
2018 has been a stressful year for my family. There has been a TON going on and although I believe I am handling things well I wonder if my body is just stressed way out? Is that possible?
My parents split early 2018 after my mom was rediagnosed with cancer and had more surgeries. Their dynamic/relationship itself is stressful.
In two years I have had 6 miscarriages, almost lost my uterus, lost both my falopian tubes (rendering me infertile), had an emergency surgery, almost lost my husband very gruesomely, had IVF for infertility (cost is ridiculous), had another surgery ripe with life-threatening complications that left me on bed rest, found out all 8 embryos from IVF were all abnormal. We have a 4 year old perfect child and I wonder if I am holding things down and it is causing my body to stress. I feel like I am doing ok but sometimes I sit back and wonder if that is actually true? Can I be fine emotionally and not physically? I am young and it was a total shock to everyone that none of my 21 eggs and 8 embryos were good?! I just worry my body might be saying... ""DONE!"".",stress-management
Ever Heard Of PNES?,"PNES means Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures. I've been having seizures for over a decade now, and finally I was able to go to a doctor (insurance trouble). My neurologist discovered my brain was not damaged, and that in fact what was causing the seizures as well as things like pain, skin problems, and much more, was stress.
PNES, to be short, is seizures caused by the mind being under psychological distress. What this means is that a lot of physical conditions that you may have could actually be caused by stress itself. Often the mind wiill sort of manifest a physical ailment when nothing is actually physically wrong, all in order to shift focus away from the stress itself. This, however, results in a looping effect since you will likely become even more stressed out by the physical manifestation of stress!I would say it's a good idea to see your doctor about such things. I've seen people who've had all sorts of problems that led doctors to search for a physical cause, but found nothing. Later on when theirr stress was relieved, the problems disappeared. These problems can be nearly anything. For example, I have aphasia, memory loss, seizures, pain, insomnia, and countless other issues with no actual physical evidence to be found.So if you have always been told you were making something up, I know what that feels like, I was told that for the longest time. Mind over matter, right? If somethine like the placebo effect is real, then of course stress could actually cause physical issues. Actually, that's what some researchers did. They gave sugar pills to a large group of people, some were told it would do nothing, some were told it would help with pain, others were told it would cause insomnia, pain, or something like that. Those who were told it would cause a problem actually experienced the problems they were told of, despite it being nothing but a sugar pill.",stress-management

Instead of doing my regular 10 minutes of meditation I did about 25 just trying to clear my mind for the work day. My heart and mind feel heavy. Im doing my best to not give in and do things I shouldnt. I need some positive stories to get me through the day. 
It comes closer and closer to the day Im going to be living in my house alone. Ive never lived alone and im worried about how I am going to handle things. My anxiety keeps rising as im dreading sunday.. 
I need to focus. I spent a lot of time researching meditation last night so that I can create some good out of my roommates old room. Im going to turn it into a zen room. Im going to buy meditation pillows, and get a bunch of incense, oil diffusers, and crystals. Just to have an escape room. Does anyone have anything similar? 
I also looked into indoor gardening for herbs and some of my favourite flowers and Im hoping that makes my house feel more like a home.

New an confused,"this might be the right page it might not, but things become a greater struggle everyday, I am 40 I am male, I am terrified and intimidated by everyone in this world without exception. Have never had anything in the way of relationships, same really for intimacy, or even online. Now the thing that caused a break in my mind which bought me here was well long term media and reality based, you see I have spent my life being the best person I have the capacity to be, my Aspergers affects my ability to read social cues aswell but yeah. 
Everything seems to contradict so my mind melts down to the point of physical illness, cause I can’t comprehend and I can’t be that. I have always thought being respectful, loving, compassionate and equal was right but then in music, movies, tv, literature (literature is a stretch) and even within reality,  you are told and see that this is not what people want, people want to be dominated, forced, violence (towards others and by definition towards them). You hear people say things like they want, love, respect, equality, their partner to be emotionally available, and then they pick up some crap like 50 shades of grey, or start dating someone that was fighting in the pub, I don’t get it and I can never be that person, kinda like the don’t objectify me 10 minutes later post a photo in a bikini without your head even in the shot, now this can also be translated for women as well of course. 
This is not all encompassing I am sure there are others out there, but we don’t get to see them as much anymore. It just feels that at every moment we need to be a completely different person to be good enough for anyone. There is more to this but I am trying to limit potential triggers for people.
i will possibly never find love, even like is a stretch, but despite the pain I can’t be what I am incapable of being. So I am limited to loving myself, this is fine but lacks the comfort and tactile enjoyments that come with love, but perhaps love is just a by-product of my idealistic mind.",shyness
social anxiety,"Hi everybody! This is my first time here and I was just hoping to get some advice from ppl outside of whom I know. I noticed that my social anxiety began after high school. During high school, I played sports and was very sociable. But now that high school is over, it's a totally different atmosphere. Sometimes I can be social but most of the time I choose not to be. My boyfriend is very social and talks to anybody who walks by us. When it comes to me having to meet new people, this rush of anxiety hits me and I get so awkward when talking to people.

don't know what to do anymore,"Hi everyone, i'm new to this group. Since I was about 12 or so my social anxiety got out of hand. I played sports but was too scared to even say hi to the people on my team. I moved to a new town when I was 14 which helped nothing. I quickly fell into a group of friends, but they honestly didn't really ask me anything about myself or fill me in on what was going on, despite the fact that I was brand new to the town and school. I hung out with them and became part of the group, but I rarely spoke. Right before high school started, they all ditched me. Stopped asking me to hang out with them, removed me from our group chat. I became extremely depressed and lonely as I didn't know anyone else and was also dealing with a severe illness. I'm now a senior in high school and although I have now made some acquaintances, I don't have any real friends. Even some of my oldest friends from my previous town make me nervous for some reason. Speaking to anyone scares me. I do have some people I kind of talk to at school and am friendly with, and I thought some of them might have started to become my friends as we were talking more and more. I've asked a lot of these people a fair number of times if they wanted to hang out (usually as a group), and not a single one of them has ever reciprocated.

I hate presenting,"So, in my AICE GEN class, we've been working on a project, where we had this poster, we drew and wrote stuff on it.

I'm a person with no friends which means I don't get to talk much with other people, which makes up much of my shyness. So, today was presentation day, every time, I present, I sometimes memorize lines to say during the presentation; WITHOUT MY notice, my WHOLE GROUP, decided to go 3RD, I didn't want to go THIRD, I wanted to go on Monday, so I could be more prepared. I wasn't prepared because I had like 4 quizzes/tests that I had to study for. They stood up and went to the present, I wasn't ready, my heart felt like it was going to explode. I held up the poster, and my legs were shaking, everyone did good, then it was MY turn, I worried, made LOTS of mistakes, stuttered, shook, paused many MANY times, and said um. . . which gets me points deducted, I went back to my seat and I just wanted to cry, I held back my tears for the whole day. Kinda started crying during lunch, went to the bathroom and washed my face. I couldn't stop crying.

What helps you with seasonal affective disorder?,"What helps me treat seasonal affective disorder is light therapy number 1. I tried it years ago, used it improperly and got a bad reaction so I didn't try it for several years. When I read up about it and followed the directions on the package i.e. doing it right this time, and it really helped. It wasn't 100% so a few years later I read that sometimes adding an additional early afternoon session as well as the 1st thing in the morning session can help some people. I tried that last winter and it significantly helped. But then I started to get a lot of reactions in the summer time that indicated that I have bipolar 2, which is a milder case of bipolar 1 disorder. Bipolar 2 causes hypomania, but bipolar 1 causes full-blown mania and can include psychosis, but not with BP 2. So I found an article on using light therapy to treat bipolar depression, and they recommended midday light therapy because it reduces the chance of becoming hypomanic. I tried it and it worked. I will continue it this fall and winter. I'm very grateful that light therapy works for me because I hate the side effects of medications especially when going on and off them. I live in British Columbia, Canada. I wish I lived in Hawaii. However, one can get too much light therapy especially if you have bipolar disorder either 1 or 2.",seasonal-affective-disorder

Hello from a new member,"I'm glad this place exists.  I'll tell you what I experience and hope I'm not alone.  I've experimented with SAD and I think I know exactly what it causes in my body.  The first thing that's weird is that I can't remember a single day of my childhood in winter (MN), but I can remember summer days perfectly. Started feeling miserable at 14 or so and thought it was due to hormones,  but it also happens to coincide with my first video game system which kept me from going outside.  This feeling was ""normal"" to me,  that's just how one is supposed to feel i guess.  Started truck driving and that surely didn't help matters.  But one day,  on my day off,  I thought about trying a tanning salon. No particular reason,  just that I never tried one before.  After this one experience,  I felt different....really different.  I started going every week.  When i made it home,  i bought a package at a tanning salon.  WOW!  I then invested in a home tanning bed and have one to this day.  I know there are light boxes,  and vitamin D therapy but I tan and there are reasons for that.  Besides the feeling of wanting to die and the thought that death sounds really awesome,  I break out on my back and head (and eventually chest if I go too long without tanning) but this isn't acne per se,  it looks like acne,  but it never gets any kind of pustule on it,  they just ITCH like you can't imagine.  Pretty soon,  my back is covered in scabs (from scratching)  which makes the itching even worse if that were possible.  A light box won't fix that problem.  High doses of vitamin D?  Well,  yes,  that's the answer but the chemisty set creation of vitamin D is nearly useless as the human body can't readily absorb it.  That's why people can take 12 or 15 thousand I.U.'s and it barely helps. I know tanning is taboo,  but I don't bake in there.  I'd rather live a shorter life and feel good,  than be miserable and live a long time.  Thanks!",seasonal-affective-disorder
Wow,I didn't think there were term for this. S.a.d!?? I had wondered but it is possible!,seasonal-affective-disorder
"If you are suicidal from SAD, I say, ""Move ASAP""","My suicidal thoughts that plagued me for 20 years have not returned in 6 years since the day I picked up and left Illinois for sunny Albuquerque, NM.  Not a single psychiatrist of mine in 20 years ever was smart enough to suggest SAD, but I had to figure it out myself.  If you need to move, move!  Don't let anyone talk you out of it.  I knew I HAD to make a change when I thought of killing myself using my car, and then realized my baby was in the car with me at that moment!  I decided then that my children were NOT going to lose their mother to suicide, no matter what upheaval I had to cause my family to heal myself by slowly relocating all of us.
Once moving to NM, I experienced 3 full years of not one single ""bummed out"" day.  It was like taking off sunglasses that I'd been wearing for 20 years straight.  Now, perhaps my body has acclamated to the extreme sunlight here and even craves more, so I have noticed now a slight depression during winter months here, but it's nothing like before.  Not a single suicidal ideation has creeped back in.  For the slight depression, I have used a light lamp, which helps a little bit.  My mental health is definitely manageable at this point.
I just encourage those of you with SAD who are desperate, do something drastic like moving!  Save yourself!",seasonal-affective-disorder
What helps you with seasonal affective disorder?,"What helps me treat seasonal affective disorder is light therapy number 1. I tried it years ago, used it improperly and got a bad reaction so I didn't try it for several years. When I read up about it and followed the directions on the package i.e. doing it right this time, and it really helped. It wasn't 100% so a few years later I read that sometimes adding an additional early afternoon session as well as the 1st thing in the morning session can help some people. I tried that last winter and it significantly helped. But then I started to get a lot of reactions in the summer time that indicated that I have bipolar 2, which is a milder case of bipolar 1 disorder. Bipolar 2 causes hypomania, but bipolar 1 causes full-blown mania and can include psychosis, but not with BP 2. So I found an article on using light therapy to treat bipolar depression, and they recommended midday light therapy because it reduces the chance of becoming hypomanic. I tried it and it worked. I will continue it this fall and winter. I'm very grateful that light therapy works for me because I hate the side effects of medications especially when going on and off them. I live in British Columbia, Canada. I wish I lived in Hawaii. However, one can get too much light therapy especially if you have bipolar disorder either 1 or 2.",seasonal-affective-disorder
SAD in full force... Ugh,"The SAD finally hit again in full force. It didnt until this month. I was doing great... until January. The weather has turned very cold and very very cloudy and windy. I live in the desert of NM... but for even here it is very dark and gloomy. We have had very little sunshine this whole past month. 
I am inside a LOT this month and I am going stir crazy w/ 3 dogs. I am tired and dragging. 
I finally drug out the LED Therapy light that I got a few years back. Some winters I do not have to use it. I got a really good one. It's called Carribean Sun. I got it online for $200. It is  a great size and sits on the side table beside me, which is good bc it is not supposed to be starred at or sit right in front of you. 
I am going to have to use it on these dark, gloomy days.
I cannot imagine living in the northeast. I did live in CO at one time, but we had sunshine and I got outside all the time. But this days on end w/o sun is the pits.
Thx for listening to me whine.

Ppd when do you get over it,So I had ppd with 12 hours of having my daughter. She had some health issues and I was worried for her. I have depression and anxiety before and after pregnancy. How do you know when it’s gone? My little girl is now 7 months old. I’m still depressed and a stay at home mom with two under two. ,post-partum-depression
Post partum depression turned perinatal,"Not sure if there is a perinatal depression support group but hopefully I can find some help here. I have always had anxiety, PTSD, depression but it had never been severe until 2 years after having my first daughter. She just turned 4 and I felt like I was just barely managing it when I found out I was pregnant again. I feel very alone as my family has never been close or supportive of me and ive never felt this anxious and depressed before. I was taking xanax but when I found out I was pregnant switched to buspar. Can't tell if it's helping or not. I feel like I could barely take care of one and feel stupid and I'll prepared to take care of another. Any kind words or relatable advice would be helpful. Usually exercise and meditation help but even those things haven't changed the severe lows and panic I feel at times. Thanks for reading all this. ",post-partum-depression

New mom with PPD...HELP,"Hello friends. I need some help.. or just a place to vent my feelings. I am a new mother (24 years old) suffering from PPD. My beautiful daughter is 2 months old. My husband does the best he can to help and support me right now. Basically i had a really complicated pregnancy and an even more complicated delivery. My daughter barely made it out alive and was in the NICU for almost 2 weeks. She still has not made a full recovery, as she has some lingering effects that may or may not go away.. according to the doctors. My PPD started after my delivery. I was sick immediately after having her and didnt get to go see her or hold her until 3 days after her birth. I feel like i was ""robbed"" and missed out on some very important first moments...(skin to skin contact, breast feeding, holding, bonding, ect.) It was also traumatic being discharged and going home without my baby. When we finally did get to take her home she was still adjusting (as most babies do) but had really bad colic and reflux. She was not tolerating feedings well at all. She would scream and cry for hours even when being held. Also, upon reading the discharge paperwork from the hospital there were several procedures that took place during the delivery and NICU that were not discussed with me afterward. I feel like i was left in the dark and the doctors did not show any regard for me as their patient.They had gone against my wishes without consulting with me first.  Needless to say, this in part contributed to my PPD. 

Anyways, here i am. with a 2 month old daughter who i love dearly, but half the time i cant stand to be around her. I feel like a completely different person.. like a switch was flipped in my brain and made me do a total 180. I get irritable and angry at her from crying.. I speak terribly to her at times and then feel horribly guilty after and cry. I have had several thoughts and dreams about harming her or myself. I feel like a terrible mother/person for having these thoughts. I often have to separate myself from her to regain control over my emotions. I dont trust myself at times. I feel empty and alone.. i hardly ever feel happy anymore. Im going to therapy twice a week and taking latuda but it isnt helping much. I have support from my husband and a few friends but i dont think they really get it. My husband will make remarks about me being ""cranky/in a bad mood/pissy"" he often times tries to make jokes about my depression... He doesnt really understand what im going through and its hard to talk to him about it. He often times just passes my emotions off as ""needing more sleep/food"". I dont know what to do becasue im about to loose my mind.. i cant keep living like this. Im miserable. Im not myself and i hate the person I am becoming. 
",post-partum-depression
how PPD feels to me...,"Its so hard to put into words how I am feeling. Its not just one emotion… it’s a flood of emotions all at once. It feels like my brain is overloading and can’t process anything.

Its more than just being cranky… being cranky can be fixed with a nap or a snack. Having PPD can’t be fixed that easily. Its more than being cranky/upset bc cranky people don’t think about hurting themselves or their baby…

What I feel is not a joke. Its not something to just “sleep off.” Its a serious issue. When you have a bad day how many times do you think about hurting yourself? When I have a bad day, that thought never leaves my mind... its constantly lingering over my head. I’ve thought about grabbing the scissors in my bathroom... or a knife from the kitchen. Maybe not enough to kill myself, but just enough to feel the pain... to let everything going on inside of me escape… to just feel some sort of relief from all the pressure and tension fighting with the emotions inside my head.

I don’t know how to get others to understand how I truly feel. But I will try to put it into words so you have an idea. Just imagine a million thoughts racing through your head all at once and no way to filter them. Imagine feelings of emptiness, feeling completely and utterly alone, extreme guilt, anxiety, not feeling good enough, anger, rage, misery, violent and sinister thoughts, constantly looking for an answer/explanation that isn’t there, extreme amounts of hatred, no desire to eat, no motivation to do anything, constant fatigue, sadness, feeling unloved/unappreciated/unwanted, feeling out of your skin/not yourself, hating yourself so much you wish you weren’t here anymore, fighting every single urge in your body not to harm yourself or your child. And then the look of fear and mortification on your child’s face when you yell at them and the instant feeling of the worst remorse you could ever imagine. The worst pit in your stomach that feels never ending and takes over your whole body until it trembles. The most horrible feeling and guilt and worthlessness in the entire world. That’s how I feel. Not just one, or two at a time, but all those emotions at once when I’m in a “bad mood” so its more than just being “cranky”

Its horrible to form life inside of your body and then have it ripped out. And then have your body piece itself back together all while trying to be your childs only food source (and at their beckon call). She relies solely on me for survival while im trying to survive each day.. and it’s a struggle. And then to have this expectation as a  mother to bond with your child and to have this all encompassing love for her. How am I supposed to love her, when I cant even love myself.

Im miserable everyday. Not because of my husband or my daughter, im just miserable bc im trying to find myself again. I know this is not me, and this is not the person I want to become. I hate the person I am now.

Concerned,"Hey Guys and Gals and Everyone Else,

My wife and I lost our son earlier this year when he was stillborn. She grieved, but mostly in her own mind (I hope you understand what I mean). She never talks about it, she didn't really cry that I saw. She seemed OK. But then our cat died a few days ago. She is inconsolable. She can't stop crying and she seems truly grief stricken. She has bipolar, which I don't always understand. Why is she losing it about the cat, when she seemed to make it through before? Sorry if I sound like I don't care, this isn't something I really understand. But I want to know how best to help her and be there for her.",post-partum-depression
Seeking Advice for Coping With PPD,"Hi Everyone,
I'm a new mom with an 8 month old baby, and I've been diagnosed with PPD characterized by suicidal ideation and the desire to self injure. I'm also experiencing anxiety attacks, feelings of intense anger, difficulty experiencing positive emotions, feelings of isolation, and extreme concern for my child's wellbeing (e.g. checking for breathing at night and during naps, feeling like normal crying episodes mean that there's something seriously wrong). I talked to a psychiatrist early on and I thought that helped, but I moved to another state and haven't seen a doctor or therapist here yet. I'm reading a book on PPD called This Isn't What I Expected and posting here, and I think I should find a therapist and/or in person support group but am having a hard time motivating myself to do so. Do you guys have any advice on other things I could try to help alleviate the PPD symptoms or to motivate myself to find more help?",post-partum-depression
I snapped and kicked my 1 year old,"Tonight I finally snapped. I was cleaning my kitchen and my 18 month old started going through the cabinets and tearing up the paper towel roll all over the floor. I didn’t want to grab it from him with my dirty hands since I was washing the dishes and kick him. I was trying to kick the paper towel roll out of his hands but instead kicked him in the leg. Of course I freak out and think omg I kicked him. So I dry off my hands and grab the paper towels from him, which he was still tearing up, and hug him. So many thoughts rush though my head like wtf is wrong with me, I’m a horrible mom and I can’t believe I kicked him. I’ve been so stressed out because my husband has been working a lot and I haven’t been getting any help. The house is in shambles and I was just trying to do a little cleaning. It honesty happened so fast and it’s all melting into a huge blur. He seems fine since he didn’t cry or seem fazed. But now I question myself. Did I kick him on purpose because I wanted him to stop or was I aiming for the paper towels. I’ve been putting off getting help but lately my anxiety has been getting worse and I’m scared everything I do with my son is going to hurt him. I used to obsess over sbs and still do sometimes. I’m trying to recall how much force I kicked him with. I know it wasn’t hard but the fact I did it in the first place has me over thinking about it. Should I stress about it still and does anyone have any tips on how to deal with postpartum depression?",post-partum-depression
I’m so empty,hi. I’m a new mom to a wonderful baby girl. We named her Winifred but we just call her Winnie. She the best thing that has ever happened to me but I just fell so empty and lost so much. My husband works nights so I’m  alone all day and night. We wanted Winnie so bad and now that we have her I just feel some much love for her and not for anything else. I can’t sleep because I will wake up in a panic because I think I fell asleep with her in our bed and that she suffocated. And if that doesn’t keep me up then the nightmares do. I have no idea how to feel better and I feel like I never will. I want to hurt myself but because I’m the only one with my daughter all the time the thought of her crying for me breaks my heart and stops me. With my feels of self harm I thought I would  put those feeling in something positive so I stated going to the gym. It works pretty well but I can’t go as much as I would like because I don’t have anyone to watch Winnie. I’m trying to get better but I don’t feel like I have anyone. I don’t feel empty and sad because of my daughter. I feel it because of everyone else I try to deal with. I have been feeling like this for months but no one can see that I’m  drowning. I’ve only told my husband very little but I don’t see how he would know how I feel. Me posting this is a big step. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this and idk if this will help but I’m giving it a shot. ,post-partum-depression

I don't know how to explain anything right because I know that it sounds bad but I don't want to be a mother, it wasn't meant for me, and it's only going to be worse for her if I stick around.

It really gets me irritated and upset. I undergone CS and i'm feeling my area of cut is aching. When I'm trying to reach out to them for help, i am being turned down. I am starting of thinking to harm the baby or just die. I also have myoma and a cyst in my left breast. So I just wanted to die to end this all. If i will be given a chance to go back, I go to the time when i was not pregnant. I know this is wrong but what can i do?",post-partum-depression
Looking for help,"I was never an anxious person in my life, never. Pretty much a very positive person and with a zen personality. Very little things made me nervous or anxious. I would give big presentations at work and just have fun with or go to job interviews and not feel nervous at all. My husband and friends always liked and admired the way I delt with these things. 3,5 months ago I had my first baby and it was absolutely heaven. I never felt so happy in my life and the love I feel for him was something out of this World. I finally had my family. My relationship with my husband is also great and life although hard with a newborn was beautiful and happy. When he turned three months, he started nursing less (doctors saying that babies do become more efficient when eating, with time) and my breasts started not getting as full as they used to at the beginning. (He is exclusevely breastfed). I then started to panick, ""what if my baby wasn't getting enough milk?"" ""What if he's hungry?"" I then started pumping like crazy and sometimes would get almost nothing out of it - which increased my theory that my milk was drying. 
I went to his doctor and he was still gaining tons of wheight - she congratulated me on that and also had a consultation with a lactation specialist, who also said that was nothing wrong with my milk supply, but the body does change after breastfeeding for a while, the breasts don't get as full as before and the babies do spend less time on the breasts simply because they learn how to eat faster/more efficient. And that pumps will never get as much milk as a baby, they just don't. Also, he still had just as many wet diappers as before - a clear indication that he wasn't dehydated. 
Even with all these great news, the anxiety that settle in during these days, didn't vanished. I know worried more and more about other stuff not related to breastfeeding, about his nails - so hard to cut, keep scratching himself, his naps - short, not giving me time to do anything, the fact that he has never taken a bottle and would struggle in case my breastmilk do dry. And all new case scenarios of made up fears that probably won't ever even happen. I don't feel sadness or like crying,  but the anxiety, oh boy, it is intense.
I then called my doctor and told him over the phone that I was experiencing anxiety and that I've never felt this before. He prescribed Zoloft. I held on because I wanted to do some research on it before starting taking it. I then talked to a psychiatrist friend of mine and he told me that the zoloft is harmless for the baby and that would help, but the main thing was to make an internal work in my mind. Identify my fears and reasons for anxiety and talk, talk, talk about it. Not to be ashamed of it. There's nothing wrong in admitting you have a problem. It is actually a sign of strengh to be able to do that. 
I did tell my husband and talked to him extensivly on how Im feeling and he's been extremely supportive and caring. I did started taking the Zoloft last night and will visit my doctor on Monday when I plan to also talk to him and tell him how Im feeling and ask for more help and support. I really want to get out of this feeling and go back to my normal self, feeling the happiest I've ever been, enjoying life without worring too much over stuff I have zero or very little control over. 
Did anybody here felt something similar? How did you get through? Does it get better? Does it go away for good? Do we go back to our normal selves as before?
Feeling hopeful.

So I stole something from my work place...,"Hey fellow kleptos,
I've never posted directly in this group before since I joined about 4 years ago. I have been a klepto my entire life, since I'm about 6...
Anyway... I manage a liqour store here in NYC. It's a mom and pop store, I absolutely love and adore my job. I genuinely mean that. So recently, I made a HUGE, 'put my job in jeporday' type of mistake.
Before closing the store at the end of the day last week, I didnt have the money for one of my FAVE bottles of Blue Chair Key Lime Rum. ( If ya'll never had it, it tastes like friggin ice cream!)  I had my best friend and her fiance coming over that night after work, I was completely broke and I took the bottle home with me any way, without purchasing it. I planned on paying for it the next morning when I came into work with the money my best friend was going to give me for the bottle.
Of course, the owner found out before I could and she said this to me ""It's not the fact that you took it home, it was that you lied to me about it , when I asked you if you knew where the missing bottle was. I have NO PROBLEM if you came to me and said ""hey, I dont have the money until payday, and ASKED me if You can take a product and then take it from my check etc.""
She didnt fire me, like I was expecting to be. She also added ""You're a great worker, you do alot for the store, you have done alot during the whole COVID situation (she means, Im the only one one staff who showed up after they said liqour stores were essential on the news; the whole staff shit out on her) 
She said its going to take a while for me to gain her trust back, and rightfully so. Im very down about this.
I really love the owner and shes a good person, any advice? I know I need to walk an exremely straight line of course, but I do NOT EVER plan on pulling this again.

I need help,"My name is Audrey and I started stealing 5-6 years ago. At fist it was small things like gum or a chocolate bar but now its bigger like phone's airpods shoes and money. Recently I got caught stealing from my uncle's son and I felt horrible. It wasn't like I needed the 40 dollars and the wind-up mouse toy but I couldn't help it. When I was in the restroom my cousin discovered his things in my bag. When he told his father he got angry and I'm no longer welcome back at his home. I can't live like this anymore. Please help!

Trying to fight the urge...,"The last time I walked through Wal-Mart, I started to get the urge to steal something. It really did not matter what I was taking everywhere I went in that store, I thought why not. I managed to get out of the store without taking anything, but I came close to. It has been about a month since I've stolen anything from anywhere. I don't know what's wrong with me. When I steal, I'm not doing it for any gain. I don't need the stuff I take. I don't even do it for the thrill of not getting caught. It's weird, but sometimes I feel like I want to get caught. I don't do anything to hide that I'm stealing. I have done it in front of god and everybody, especially near cameras. The stores know I'm stealing. The police have a record of me.",kleptomania
Hit rock bottom,"Hi, I'm new to all this, but I'm pretty sure I've hit rock bottom. I've got/had my dream job which i am pretty sure I've just thrown out the window due to my stupidity of stealing. I have been stealing little things for years, but this time i've been charged. Have got court in a few week's time. Yes I'm scared shitless, i really love my job, but I've been stood down at the moment due to my stupidity. 
I don't have contact with any of my family, especially my daughter, whom I love dearly. I have pushed every one away & am hoping I don't push my hubby away as he's been my rock through all this.  
I don't talk to my parents as my brother sexually assaulted me when I was a teenager.  He still lives at home, hence why i don't talk to my parents.  If I told them they wouldn't believe me anyway. 
I'm nearly 54 and still doing this crap and don't know how to get off this rollercoaster of this behaviour.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  ",kleptomania
I need to stop stealing but I cant,"I'm 56 yrs old. I started stealing about 6 years ago while I was in a very stressful relationship. Got caught 3 times so I went to jail and what they call rehab. About a year, total time. After that I got divorced and was doing ok. Not stealing. Then my brother was hurt in a fire and I was trapped again with another crazy man stressing me out and I started stealing again. It's been a year and I know I'm gonna get caught and I'm terrified. But I keep finding myself at a store and I absolutely have to have this thing (dress purse shoes glasses or whatever) which I don't need but I have to have it and I steal it. I hate it. So freaking much. Please. If you have any advice. Please. I don't want to go to prison but that's where I'm headed if I don't stop asap. It's inevitable. If you have any tips or something you do to stop yourself please share it. I'm desperate. I'm scared. Thanks.",kleptomania
I hate myself,"I’m 16 years old with a job and I keep stealing and today I got caught And thankfully the police were not called I was just asked to leave the Store. I have a job now and I have money I don’t understand why I do this but when I got caught my whole body went cold and then hot And I realized the mall that I work at could know that I did this so I need to stop.  I don’t know why I do it maybe it’s a way to feel a thrill but I feel guilty sometimes and then I feel a bit of pride as sick as that sounds and I hate myself feeling it. So I googled how to stop stealing and I don’t want to keep a journal because someone might find it so I cited join a support group in hopes it would help me. I know that some people do the same thing that I do but I still feel alone and I hate myself for what I do.  If anyone could help me with this I would really appreciate it.

How do I stop this?,"I admit that I have a problem and no matter what happens, no matter how badly I feel, I can’t seem to stop stealing. I’m trying so hard to better myself, to change my ways, but something always falls in front of me and I wind up at square one all over again.

I got caught and I felt nothing,"A couple days ago, I was caught stealing from a store. I was told I'm not welcomed there and if I come back, the police will be called. If I'm being honest, I should have been caught sooner. I did nothing to hide my stealing. I just walked in, grabbed the item, slide in my pant leg, buy what I wanted from there, then leave. I wasn't doing it to taunt the workers. Sometimes I wasn't even aware of what I was doing. When I got back home, I check my pockets and went ""Why the hell did I get this?"" ""Do I even need that?"" or whatever. It was only a matter of time before I was caught anyway, so I'm not angry, upset, or anything. I'm just blaise about it. When I saw the guy who caught me at the local Wal-Mart the next day, he walked up to me and said, ""are you going to steal that?"" I looked at him right in the eye and said, ""No because I only stole from your store. Everywhere else I pay for what I want. Good evening, sir!"" I made him so mad that he wanted to take a swing at me, but instead he just heckled me around the store. He thought it was bullshit, but its not. I have never stolen from any store besides his. I really don't know why. I really don't know why I'm so nonchalant about it. I don't think I'm evil, but I'm not sure anymore. If I can do something I know is wrong and I don't gain any benefit from it, what type of person does that make me.I don't know who else I can tell. If I tell my friends, they'll treat me like I'm a thief. If I tell my family, they'll just pretend I have no problems. I see a psychiatrist, but if I tell him, he'll just tell me not to do it. No matter how many times I tell him, I can't control it at that store.",kleptomania

I don't think this group is very active, but I really just need to talk to someone.
I've had a problem with stealing since about 4 - 5 years ago, and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder as well.
But this week it has literally ruined my life. 
I took a chance by taking something from work (which I have never ever done) and was caught.
I have tried to get help for my problem. I've spoken to a professional but it's never really been too indepth.  
So now my close family and friends know about my problem. All my work colleagues know. I have never been this ashamed in my life.
I never thought that it would be such a problem. I've always that that I won't get caught, but that ""I'll probably stop soon anyways""
I just need to talk to someone. Someone who knows this. My family has so many questions and I'm not sure how to answer them. I feel so helpless. And so alone in this, that I feel like I need to turn to an online support group. 
Anyways. I hope I'll from you guys soon :)",kleptomania
Kleptomania/Compulsive Buying Behaviour,"Hi everyone. I was wondering if you could help me out. I am a third year university student doing a dissertation.

Could i take 5/10 minutes of your time in completing this questionnaire on Compulsive Buying Behaviour and Kleptomania, I am looking into whether there is a relationship between the two.

There is not much literature or data of there being a relationship between the two so I am hoping to increase the research of this topic with your help! 

The questionnaire is 100% confidential and anonymous. So please be truthful so I can get accurate results. 

Appreciate your time, thank you :)

Why can't I stop stealing,"Hi all
I really don't know what to do anymore.  I have been stealing for 40 years.  On and off, mostly on. I've been arrested, jailed and I still go back to stealing.  I wonder if I'll ever stop.  I lost relationships and people that I love over this addiction.  I've been to therapy, 12 step meetings, all while I was still stealing. I know it is wrong and I know I will be punished but I still do it.  I don't need any of the stuff I steal but while I steal it, I convince myself that I 'must have it' (even if I already have it at home).  It is insane.  What is odd is that I am a very intelligent and responsible in all other areas.  I just can't (or refuse to) change?  What is even crazier is that when I steal, I kinda know that I'm going to get caught and I still go through with it.  Like I'm super-woman or something.  Also, I'm completely out of touch with reality when I steal.  It's all about the mission to do it and get out.  Nothing, not security or cameras deter me.
Can anyone relate to what I just wrote or am I the only person on earth who is this insane?  
Please reply.  Thanks

An experience about a stuttering course,"Hello everyone
I wanna talk about my experience about my stuttering course. Basically, I always stutter all my life, it is not too severe but it exists. So, I started to college but it makes eveything difficult because you need to study at prep school which is English before school. I started it and my stutter made me uncomfotable at all. One day I was really a bad situation and I decided to stop my college until I fix my stutter. I go to a stummering course. They use a technique which is called shaping. .Basically, you stretching the first syllable of every the word that you say while you are speaking. Like Oooooovercoming yoour sıııtamer like that. While I used this technic for 3 months and I was pretty good. However, after that, I continue to speak normally again. And everything was the same. I stutter again. I do not know if this technique works or not right now. but what do you think about that? ",stuttering

So if you know ın England I can join some summer school for improving English. Can you inform me? or does someone know a course about stammering at England? maybe it can affect my stummer positivily and English.  ",stuttering

Bad Day at Work,"Hello all, 
This past Friday, I was in a meeting at work where I'm usually fairly comfortable among the colleagues that are usually in these meetings, However, that day was a little different.  My department head is usually part of these meetings and will field all questions directed our way.  He couldn't make it that day so I was the lone representative from our business unit.  Halfway through the meeting, I was asked to explain how we used a certain software program that the company is looking to change.  I could feel the eyes awaiting my reply, about 15 people plus 10 more on the phone in a different city.  I stuttered quite a bit and I noticed one of my colleagues quietly leave the room.  He came back a couple minutes later with two other people from my department who had not been asked to attend the meeting.  They had to explain everything that I had been unable to do because of my stutter.
This doesn't happen often but when it does, it's extremely embarrassing and it makes me feel inadequate and stupid.  I know my job very well, I work hard at it, but it feels like all of that work and dedication just goes out the window when something like this happens.  It was a bad day and I'm trying to put it behind me now, but I wonder what the conversation was like after the meeting with those 10 people calling in from a different city.  Did my colleagues re-tell the story over a round of drinks after work?  Was it relayed to my director, and if so, what were his comments?   
I can't answer these questions, all I can do is soldier on and hope for a better day tomorrow.  Thanks for reading!

New to group,"Hello everyone. My name is Matt and I am a professional drummer. I am not ashamed to say that I stutter. I have had this disorder since I was a little boy. When I was little, and even as an adult, I have been made fun of and laughed at. For people who do not have this disorder, some think it's funny or even amusing. I do not in any way think it is funny. Over the last few years, I have had a few instances where I got up enough courage to stand up for myself. I remember this one time when I was about thirteen years old. My mother and I went into this pizza place. I was standing at the counter trying to place an order when I was having difficulty speaking. The employee behind the counter started to laugh at me. I remember I turned around and just walked out crying. My mother went back inside and gave that jerk a piece of her mind.
I found out later that that jerk was fired. I remember other times but I am only wanting to introduce myself a little bit. I have been struggling with this disorder for almost my entire life. I have had speech therapy and for a while, my speech was slightly improved. Over these past few months, I have been speaking a lot faster. When I speak faster, my stuttering gets worse and I am less relaxed. I have tried many many times to stay relaxed when I speak but it doesn't really help. I am looking some support right now and to possibly make some new friends. I am looking foward to gettting to know some of you. Thanks for reading my post.

I have blocked out my childhood anyhow. As I was describing using a flamethrower, etc. I realized that the urge to start a small fire (safely in a large tin that I have for candles) was overwhelming me. I couldn't think of anything else. So, I did it. I burned a candle (and some papers) and the relief was just so sweet. I felt alive, whole, and calmed. Now for the past few days, I can not think of anything else. I long for fire. Right now, my urge is very quiet but I know before bed, I will have to burn again. I am not sure if this is anything I should be worried about. I don't fit the DSM criteria 100%...well...almost.

Điều này sẽ giúp bạn tăng tính cạnh tranh hơn so với các đối thủ cạnh tranh khác cùng ngành hàng và kiếm được cho mình nhiều đơn hàng, nhiều khách hàng hơn nữa. Bạn có thể tự học SEO tại nhà nhưng cách tốt nhất thì bạn vẫn nên tham gia các khóa đào tạo SEO bài bản từ cơ bản đến nâng cao tại các trung tâm.

Những công thức làm đẹp từ tinh dầu bưởi đối với t,"Chúng ta có thể kể ra hàng loạt những ưu điểm nổi bật từ sản phẩm tinh dầu bưởi - một loại mỹ phẩm dành cho tóc được sản xuất với thành phần 100% tự nhiên như: an toàn cho da đầu, không gây tác dụng phụ, hiệu quả cao,.... Nhưng trong số đó thì có lẽ rất ít người để ý đến một ưu điểm riêng mà hầu hết các loại mỹ phẩm từ hóa chất đều không thể có được. Đó chính là khả năng kết hợp giữa hai hoặc nhiều loại sản phẩm lại với nhau trong một lần sử dụng nhằm tăng tính hiệu quả https://vi-vn.facebook.com/tinhdaubuoi24hkichthichmoctoctrirungtoc/.

Tóc của chúng ta có rất nhiều kiểu hình khác nhau; cụ thể thì sẽ có nhiều người tóc quá mềm hoặc ngược lại là quá cứng. Mặt khác thì có người tóc có độ dầu quá cao nhưng có người thì độ dầu lại quá ít khiến tóc trở nên khô. Ngoài ra thì còn rất nhiều yếu tố khác khiến cho chúng ta khó có thể lựa chọn loại mỹ phẩm thích hợp dành cho làn tóc của mình.
Về phương diện này thì khả năng kết hợp nhiều loại mỹ phẩm từ thiên nhiên sẽ đem lại những ưu thế cực cao. Bởi chúng ta có thể tùy ý kết hợp giữa những loại sản phẩm riêng biệt nhằm đem lại lợi ích tốt nhất và phù hợp nhất cho kiểu tóc của mình. Và ngay sau đây, chúng tôi sẽ đưa ra một số công thức kết hợp giữa sản phẩm chính là tinh dầu bưởi và các loại sản phẩm khác để giúp bạn dễ dàng tham khảo 【 Tinh Dầu Bưởi 24H 】 Kích Thích Mọc Tóc Và Trị Rụng Tóc.
♦ Công thức dành cho tóc dầu
Khi độ dầu trên tóc quá cao thì lúc nào cũng tạo cho chúng ta một cảm giác có một lớp mỡ đang bám dính lấy bề mặt phần thân tóc. Điều này sẽ làm giảm đi phần nào về mặt thẩm mỹ đối với bộ tóc của chúng ta.
Nguyên nhân tạo ra tóc dầu có thể do chính cách chăm sóc tóc của chúng ta chưa thực sự phù hợp hoặc một số nguyên nhân khách quan thường gặp như yếu tố môi trường, sự thay đổi đột ngột nội tiết tố trong cơ thể,...
Và để khắc phục trường hợp này thì bạn cần sử dụng đến tinh dầu bưởi kết hợp với quả bồ kết. Đầu tiên, bạn cần đem bồ kết đã được phơi khô giã hơi nát và cho vào nấu chúng với nước. Liên tục khuấy đều đến khi phần nước chuyển hoàn toàn sang màu nâu sẫm thì ngưng lửa lại. Lọc bỏ toàn bộ phần bã bồ kết và hòa chung khoảng 5ml tinh dầu vỏ bưởi nguyên chất vào. Sử dụng nước này để gội đầu hàng ngày sẽ giúp tóc của bạn duy trì độ ẩm & độ dầu vừa đủ.

♦ Công thức dành cho tóc khô
Khi tóc quá khô thì sẽ rất dễ bị gãy rụng bởi những tác động thường ngày như: vuốt tóc, chải đầu,... Ngoài ra, tóc quá khô cũng phần nào thấy được sự thiếu hụt vitamin và dưỡng chất để nuôi dưỡng tóc. Trong trường hợp này thì chúng ta cần nhanh chóng khắc phục nhằm chặn đứng những hư tổn có thể gây ra do tóc khô.
Hỗn hợp tinh dầu bưởi và dầu dừa sẽ là sự lựa chọn tốt nhất dành cho bạn. Bởi ngoài việc bổ sung dưỡng chất thì dầu dừa là loại mỹ phẩm thiên nhiên có khả năng tăng cường độ ẩm tốt nhất cho cả tóc & da đầu.
Trước tiên chúng ta cho một lượng vừa phải dầu dừa vào bên trong lòng bàn tay và cho vào đó khoảng từ 1 - 3 giọt tinh dầu nguyên chất. Xoa đều hỗn hợp giữa hai lòng bàn tay và xoa đều lên toàn bộ phần tóc & da đầu. Trùm kín tóc để ủ trong 20 phút để dưỡng chất được hấp thụ là có thể gội lại bằng nước sạch.
♦ Công thức dành cho tóc quá yếu
Trường hợp tóc quá yếu sẽ rất dễ dàng để chúng ta có thể nhận biết. Bởi nếu tóc chúng ta quá yếu thì khi tạo những kiểu tóc bằng phương pháp như uốn, kẹp, bấm,... thì không thể giữ trong khoảng thời gian quá lâu mà chỉ cần một hoặc nửa ngày là tóc sẽ có dấu hiệu trở lại như ban đầu. Điều này sẽ khiến chúng ta khó có thể tạo được những kiểu tóc yêu thích.
Đối với trường hợp này thì bạn có thể lựa chọn sử dụng hỗn hợp giữa tinh dầu bưởi cùng dầu olive hoặc dầu argan. Những hỗn hợp này sẽ giúp tóc của chúng ta nhanh chóng tăng thêm độ dày và được nâng cao sự chắc khỏe vượt trội hơn rất nhiều so với bình thường. Và chỉ sau khoảng 2 - 3 tháng áp dụng thì chắc chắn bạn sẽ không cần phải lo lắng đến bộ tóc của mình trong những lần đi làm đẹp nữa https://tinhdau24h.co/tinh-dau-buoi/hair-lotion/.

Công thức để thực hiện gồm 1ml tinh dầu bưởi hòa vào 1 muỗng dầu olive hoặc dầu argan. Trộn đều hỗn hợp này rồi bắt đầu thấm vào bông để chấm lên toàn bộ vùng da đầu. Trong mỗi một ngày thì chúng ta cần phải thực hiện đều đặn hai lần, đặc biệt là vào mỗi buổi tối trước khi đi ngủ bởi đây chính là khoảng thời gian tốt nhất để chăm sóc tóc.
Kết luận: ngoài những công thức trên thì bạn còn có thể tìm hiểu về rất nhiều sản phẩm có thể pha trộn khác như tinh dầu hương nhu, oải hương, sả chanh, tinh dầu cam hoặc lòng trắng trứng. Đây đều là những loại mỹ phẩm từ thiên nhiên có khả năng đem lại tác dụng rất lớn dành cho tóc.",pyromania
